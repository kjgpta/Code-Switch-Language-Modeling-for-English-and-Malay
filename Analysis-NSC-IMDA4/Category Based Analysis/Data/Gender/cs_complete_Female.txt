why korang never just start your name with like arina and diana
ya so sekarang orang panggil kau arina kan
oh ya abeh dia takyah surgery
kurang ajar sia tu
apa nak cakap like you grow out of this
ya last time I was okay cute then after that suddenly the you know period eh period pula sekali the maturing phase I oh my god I just look so oof but okay lah at least now I look better
ya but it was so funny was so funny literally funny gila
nice ke
sekolah kita is just not creative
primary five right starting of primary five I like this guy so much then I was I already prepared I rehearse kat rumah you know I rehearse how do I tell this guy then then I talk to the wall all this like pretending like that guy is the guy ah then after that sekali I met him in real life that time was Mendaki so Mendaki class then I told him ah I like him right then he reject me sia
you don't know who but her name was zulaikha I told her macam eh I like this guy sia then she she encourage me to confess to the guy you know I confess to the guy right then after that tak jadi then I told her semua then the guy cakap like he not ready all this then after that she like she cheer me up all this right end up you guess what two weeks later she got together with the guy
you gave me encouragement and all then suddenly kau yang get together with the guy
oh my god dia dah pergi dengan amira is it
see kalau she want to lie to you kan what is this
petty sia kau
zennis yang kawan dia iman tu she's muslim right
oh then kat luar it's already the swimming pool
oh she wear jubah
wait but right dia is she like religious
eh diam lah
buta sia
then after that why you all sit together dekat-dekat
but I actually want to know right how how you found the motivation to wear hijab like fully like what makes you
apa eh yang safi saw in this guy
okay wait I actually know the story okay tapi you just story I remember I remember the story
I can see that he's very introverted you know it's like very maacam senyap from his photo also I can see he he's a very senyap kind
tak macam how how you feel like okay uh from the start eh like when you just know him
have you ask afiq whether did he like really wanted to find a hijabi girl or
then how how you feel like eh boleh if I if the guy like macam afiq eh he talk to me like that he tak jaga my hati right I straightforward nah this is not the guy then I will just like stop it how how did you just continue
tak tahu ah I just I think my heart just not open yet you know okay sekarang ni orang kau nampak yang selalu marry kan you see like mira filzah also she marry someone she met a few times only
see sekali aku like twenty plus then I met someone yang macam betul-betul like god open my eyes
she can like him not for his looks cause he's more I saw his post kan he's more of those macam work kind of guy
that kind of guy the more pandai kind of person I rather more fun kind of person than
macam aku rasa boring though
itu ah macam I thought if mira with zizan right zizan is like he he's fun and entertaining what he don't have looks I don't mind sia
they say like charli you can just post anything what and people will just like it what she can just post a picture of her stoning and she can get millions of like gitu-gitu dah ya
abeh yang the bella that one she just
no lah you very kaku sia in front of
jom ah jadi agent rumah
exactly the rich yang tak perlu they get more stuff than the people who need need cause they want promote their products obviously can make this kind of people
eh not bad sia my only drop to two point something I think ni will drop some more
dia dah dia dah twenty one he start at nineteen
twenty habis itu twenty dia twenty one eh twenty
habis poly
then after that he have to go so I think twenty one dia enlist or twenty
let's say pergi twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty three dia akan keluar twenty three baru keluar
itu pun kalau dia straightaway like okay after this I do this after this kalau dia macam nak stop sekejap nak kerja
no cause that one is right I think is kalau I don't know ah I think because I oh is masters masters then you need that one to two years of working experience
bachelor is before ni kan before degree right
you should join before before poly my friend dah masuk NAFA now
so if I'm not wrong damn expensive though but kena kerja one year
he singaporean also he have to kerja one year and tak pergi sekolah for one month
tak tau dia kata tak dapat then he work starbucks for one year baru work
tak tahu lah dia suka ah dia suka
some more mak dia tak nak bayarkan he have to pay himself
abeh yang she study and she's good at it also it's good lah because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your gaji is two point five then if you enter with a degree your gaji is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know macam two point five abeh maybe after two years later your boss naikkan gaji two point seven two point eight I don't know
so is kalau I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two ah if I go for a hospital
so they add up together dah seven K seven K is enough
bagus ah
but like I think for comfortable life macam betul-betul comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
uh no it's the same uh like food but then another another shop so like she buka same shop
mana lah aku tahu kan
like I tried lah like my mum own cooking at home sedap ah takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing eh like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help aku macam I don't like lah this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister itu semua untuk buka this kind of shop
ya you know yang kedai yang ni she actually wanted to
oh ya you actually wanted to tutup the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back pasal her her work workers macam tak bagus her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
ya it's just like that I mean dia punya pekerja like the food standard is always macam tak constant sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap that kind
my mum pay monthly four K orang semua terkejut sia
dorang macam how you make money here then mak aku macam uh cause my mum she smart lah in business she smart in business she just put everything macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua kan then they just tell people then she just put on her barang
so she just take everything and just put macam no matter benda tu orang nak ke tak just put lah like kalau orang nak beli
tapi because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum takyah lah tutup ah kedai ni mahal sia
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this one you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill kena bayar sendiri
bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri then aircon dalam tu macam rosak gitu so cannot feel
ya uh tak dia repair but you know the thing is kita tak ada aircon ah the aircon macam tak boleh rasa then abeh you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
pastu engine dia keep trip ah macam dia punya mak aku my mum say can only open like two switches at a time abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat like two switch at a time kalau nak panaskan it's like very lambat kan
abeh lepas tu then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip kan tak ada lampu for like thirty minutes tak ada lampu tau then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
what the hell two switch abeh dah lah mahal abeh kau cakap buka two switch
merepek kan then mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup jer ah kedai ni then after that my mum macam sedih ah to leave the kedai seh like like the kedai then after that my dad already dah tukarkan the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad dah tukar we can open all the switch already then it won't trip bapa aku cakap they use the wire yang lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire
ya that's why kau buka tu switch jer dah trip
exactly abeh lepas tu bapa bapa aku yang buat sia semua yang the whole wire then he do by himself then like you know my mum already put in a lot lah for that shop abeh dia sedih nak tutup the shop then after that when we ask her to tutup she like tak nak ah then she say you know what if I continue to just open the shop then at least she say monthly she can still get three K what she open another shop then she can earn more what because she's interested you know this food food shit ah aku tak aku tak interested
jom ah kita buka sama-sama kau masak aku
right right kalau kita buka together then you can cook then I will be the server
kita how about we do western food and not
malay nasi
kita taruk mi rebus plus fish and chips
or like put like chilli crab punya sauce right
or we put um kuah mi soto
ya I can see you your love for soto ayam
that soto ayam
murah seh
malay food I like you know yang nasi rawan but that was so that is so good uh uh
but it's like at pioneer point I don't know I think can sit there and eat but then kedai dia selalu tutup my father always go saturday tutup sunday tutup then my father macam apa ni business macam mana nak buka ni kalau
pasal dulu it never close you know
mahal kedai tu is like you know that time they asking from sara for twelve K a month
ya sara says sara told me last time I was close to her juga what last time
yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw macam sara punya kedai always banyak banyak queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing macam you are trying to benefit from people punya business
kedai lain semua dah tak naik tank
is cannot what cause that is the person's shop what kalau kau it's either you stay or leave ah gitu if the person say okay if you don't want pay then you leave ah
you imagine eh kalau kedai sekarang ni yang that twelve K a month you think they can earn or not after that
and like apa the shop obviously the shop owner dia sengaja nak sara punya father keluar that's why naikkan tinggi-tinggi nanti sara father cannot pay then surrender the shop
kedai tu ah
tu jer that's all you know
cause they always keluar gi malaysia all this together
now dorang ni ke
is either at home biasanya dorang masak kat rumah then they send to the shop
ya ya that's why maybe they busy ke dorang both at the shop
sekarang bapa dia bawa grab pe
should be business tak cukup or like they have a lot of things to pay ah pasal dulu kan the business very good
then after that sekarang dah tak bagus then the father ambil car abeh ambil motor berapa banyak biji motor dia nak then the father buy for the kakak the abang pun all motor abeh sekarang business dah tak bagus how then he have to grab ah bawa grab pay for all this thing because obviously all these you haven't pay finish what
kena bayar so it's either untuk aku your if I am the father I will surrender the motor then just use the car
abeh nak bayar banyak-banyak how to afford
tak lah aku tak boleh ah
kau berani naik motor macam nasib kau afiq ada motor kan nanti dia
abeh takkan kau nak bilang mak kau kan safi nak naik motor dengan
dulu aku naik motor dengan aku punya kawan lelaki semua mak aku aku rasa mak aku tak tahu at all sia
tapi actually aku pun takut aku macam dah fikir macam kalau aku jatuh ni eh kalau ayah aku tahu mampus sia
it's not like it's not the guy's fault what you also want you also want to naik
the situation sekarang COVID
ya because got crowd control so ada banyak-banyak timing so
tengok timing lah selalu kalau timing jam satu gitu lepas lunch ah
banyak orang because they all rush in
ya ah then especially kalau pakai mask kan ah tu lah
ah kan ya then I don't know I feel I feel like I a bit rude but at the same time is just takpe lah eh orang pekak so biarkan jer
ah ah seh just to ah kalau pergi shopping mall pun susah kan walaupun nak beli like one thing only like bubble tea
kan kan like um so sometimes like we just want to minum air and then like people just suddenly stare at you like chill I just I just drinking water
orang pakai mask but never cover the nose like
ah kenapa
eh apa dia buat
mmhmm and then apa
basically okay lah dua macam dua alam like malay call it dua alam
I tried going on dating apps ah you know ya ya ya Tinder Muzmatch ya especially that so bila I kat sana then
it's just the way that they text the way that they reply sometimes I don't like you know sometimes like the way they spell certain stuff you know like you can just say it to me in like one long sentence but you have to kasi short form macam
uh they are actually quite hype they they they boleh berbual ah everything but
you know what I I don't really like you know talking to you you know like just ugh very cringe but it's just you know sadly some some of them are actually nice it's just suka it's just a preference
so ya talking about that tu pun
can still use your picture obviously because if not it will be catfish lah technically kalau
right so so macam kat Telegram or what then you send the video message thing at least they know like ah okay this person is this face but the name
lain lah but tu jer maybe your age lain sikit maybe your birthday lain sikit
okay maybe one of us who are like twenty one years old nak berbual dengan dorang then tiba-tiba I don't know kena
I don't know she was a minor because she never put in her bio or something and then who's fault is it you whose one handcuffs ah you you kena
you kena what house arrest ah that one
you kena the watch on the
I think maybe to a certain extent boleh macam
macam orang yang buat macam gini just to be like a predator or something that one is a no no
okay ah so hari ni makan apa tadi tadi makan apa
ah lah takpe sama I had the Nissin seafood one very nice
seven eleven one ah ah okay lah not bad sedap juga
eh apa nama dia
dulu bila kat sekolah it's just um
I had a crush on this girl so biasa lah eh like cinta monyet everything and then just macam oh my god secondary school ada mata air baru
and then ada lah kawan ni from primary school
and then uh well I have it's just like you like I had a sus feeling you know like the vibes and everything so so okay but I still ignore lah cause I thought like mana tahu secondary school it's a different ah ya ya ya like even though it's like primary six to sec one
dah mature a bit lah ah
I was talking to the guy on the phone and everything I selalu bawa dia ajak dia into the conference call like that because okay lah me being you know seeing her as my
best friend at that point of time macam
you know I want to include you and everything I do so like I tak malu lah ya so but then it's just the the stupid thing is that um
before before that night a few days before the dude and I dah confess so so we we okay lah we say that oh I like I like you too and everything it's cute but then the thing is we confess at playground with letters we roll each other letters you know ya right it's not over over text like I I state my no lah
so on the night we were talking and everything then I ask him lah like do you do you want to go to the next level gitu biasa lah eh you know I dah desperate kan so and then he like ah boleh jer like I okay because I suka you and everything and I'm like aww okay apa-apa jer lah so as long as you and I together
cinta monyet I just said it
ya but for us we don't use puppy we use monyet so monyet because it's ya it's playful basically because we
we see monkeys as very playful so like that lah but I feel like kalau puppy love is quite cute
where was I ah so during the phone call and then we were talking like that and then my best friend was there then dia dengar jer lah so she just like okay tak tak kepoh lah because I ajak so it's fine macam member sunyi
the whole school his whole cohort dapat tahu that
ya I mean that's how much I sayang her as a friend lah that I the first person that I look to is my ex that time so and then he was like takde ah takde cakap apa-apa like you think I that kind of person to share and like that then I was like okay lah mana tahu
after that we I just like okay lah takpe I lupakan jer and then
yang perempuan tu suka dia juga so ya hmm tak player is he he's just never been in a relationship before except except for with me
apa lagi eh so lepas tu
the girl that used to like my ex uh before my ex and I got together she she hated me lah cause I so called aku rampas dia punya
ya then aku macam
bro you you never make your first move how how is it my fault precisely how is it my fault also ya sure korang suka each other but if if I like him and then somehow he fell for me also and then okay lah then that means I I put in effort what and unlike you you just you just like you see from afar and just like hi then for me it's just like
ah padahal dorang ke apa okay no hate lah sia no hate but it's just
not spending time I prefer befriending ya I forgot the word befriending dengan lelaki and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends lah
because tak buang waktu sia like kau
kau penat-penat kau berbual dengan dorang kau lepak dengan dorang and then setakat they just like eh your friend single or not then like what the fuck bro
sikit jer ke banyak ni
deserves maybe you guys never you never end it off properly macam tak sedap
itu not
steep cut but kau tak cakap apa-apa then why why would he
I I tadi marah because ada orang terlanggar you know then like your girlfriend will just rely a'ah I faham faham but if you tell a guy is just like
setakat dia cuma langgar jer pe ah like that wait maybe maybe I can say we are too sensitive or kita overreact but
hmm tu lah get out but I got this story back when I was in I had this classmate she was very clingy gitu macam dia
dia dia tak ada banyak kawan lah because dia pendiam then bila orang
sama-sama but for her it's just how to say ah
setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam class so
kalau apa-apa nak berbual it's okay lah like rather than you just have beef with everyone like for what and then
lepas tu she became clingy then mana-mana aku pergi dia nak ikut then it's like ah dia dia perangai macam lelaki like she insecure lah because she she's afraid of people abandoning her so when I talk to other classmates she will just like
eh asal kau berbual dengan dia sia then aku macam
biar ah aku nak berbual dengan siapa and then it's like and then it's like ada ah project and everything so for project work
I had to choose ah I was given finally given the chance to choose my own group because dulu is dorang main ambil jer lah which
which was sad because I had those free loaders and everything and lepas tu I didn't pick her because she herself was the free loader
but she she she never realise because sebagai kawan I never tegur because out of kesian right you know like it's your own friend you sayang your friend and everything
and then she she text me she sound me and everything she say why why you never pick me for your group and then aku cakap
oh ah aku tak pick pun dorang yang pick aku
I bohong ah because I don't want her to get hurt but in the end she did and then in the end she found out lah ya and then she
and then bila tengah buat project then she will complain like uh you know akunya group macam gini macam gitu then
but that one I feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel tak sedap hati macam apa sia aku buat aku dengan kau siapa sia kawan jer
okay lah just share share sikit leh dengan
lepak bawah blok eh ah
okay that's cute I guess macam abang-abang ah gitu kan abang-abang yang bulat ah um ah betul betul betul
oh sombong eh ah oh ya that's true
cakap jer lah
so cili padi is like small and feisty and spicy
member kucing ke robot pun tak tahu
ah so the youngest all the very degil-degil bukan ke oh shit
alah but so high so high with energy maybe maybe oh but with other people a bit oh malu-malu
so dia dia tinggal kat rumah atau
kenapa kau yang jumpa atau your family members your other family members oh
anak derhaka ni lu dengar eh dengar eh
wow that's cute um alah cute nya tak payah beli bantal ada kucing
ah so that's why you call cili padi
macam especially
ya it's just it's just ayam masak ya that's true
I don't know what kerapu
I think I tengok first because usually for me
something fancy for tengah hari lah makanan tengah hari lah
uh nasi you know
fancy tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam more like salad lah because of your condition right because of your kencing manis right your diabetes
for the for me the kids kalau ada nasi ada ikan they will eat lah
uh but I don't want to buy tadi bila I beli ikan tu I tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam ice box bau so I rather just buy satu ekor ikan lah
dari beli dua ekor itu hari I beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis
you know susah nak habis abeh end up buang you know so I rather not
sebab tu tadi bila kat sheng siong tadi
I beli satu ekor ikan aje
uh tapi ada kala pula I feel serba salah when I do that kena beli satu pula nanti the kids I want some more fish you know macam
kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada plan tapi mak bawa makan ke
you know atau my mother give food untuk uh she packed food from from her house right then she give also that would also
I have to wah I edit punya rak

you know macam if you sit you if you did it this way for your write article you will have less problem lah I would have edited even faster but semalam I
I edit tak I didn't really require a lot of time lah think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours dah habis ah edit
uh tadi I berbual dengan my
my russian teacher tu the skype over skype eh
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was err he was a having a conversation with his friends our uh what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me yang
I and the song was from tokyo square then she's like tokyo square so he thought that dia dari jepun ke group ni then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean lah it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was uh
but the song actually nice tapi dia pakai lagu sukiyaki punya lagu tau do you know sukiyaki right there's this
uh it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow kak tina to this concert by tokyo square
uh that is the originally is from tokyo square but there's some uh famous mat salleh singers sing that song lah western singers that err sing err tokyo square punya lagu but that is I say macam singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
a lot of talent lah they don't macam you know
uh but dia punya melody has been reused and reused by other bands lah but that is not the most famous tokyo square
uh because like I mean nama tokyo square tapi dari singapore you know macam
because my I think kak tina did some events ah for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
and that they were performing dekat mana tau kat depan if I am not wrong eh at this padang area near parkway parade
no macam this area dekat depan parkway ke sebelah kat parkway ke one of those area lah because parkway was you it was like a famous lah you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center dekat eighties nineties mana ada banyak
I think kalau mungkin mungkin yang singapore yang rock band lah yang dulu-dulu ah
ah the malay rock band ramli sarip all that there is known tapi for the english
medium eh english medium tak banyak that's why tokyo squares is one of tapi yang you kata sam willows sekarang famous there were a few ah
like they say kembangkan dia punya talent ah
you know macam yang ada english the err english medium ada but they are not
they are not world famous lah macam the their world famous because they perform
like macam siapa jacintha ah jacintha abisheganaden I think abisheganaden is it halim
but macam you have err macam art fazil you have err jai eh is it jai is it the
I think macam we we we know okay like macam acting a lot of them because of the
the khairul anuar join siapa apa
the malay channel lah siapa tu
ah not really talent train lah it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market macam kira malaysia ada market you know
macam nak cakap pasal comedian ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar comedian pun comedian macam err suhaimi eh suhaimi part time you know at least dia dia part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
no I think macam pasal singapore banyak pakai script
singapore the the ah they're not very good with improvisation tak bagus
ah I I I understand macam boboi boboi punya jokes eh boboi the group the maharaja lawak eh kan they have boboi they have the different
ah what is that either let like either when they talk about loghat eh there's always a tema tema like like loghat like is always going to be malaysia menang because singapore tak pandai buat loghat you know
they can really do loghat know and they really are very good at imitating macam singapore punya macam they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know macam malaysia really bercakap loghat loghat is accent right kira loghat orang kedah orang kelantan and then
kita punya loghat is loghat bahasa baku
no no but they are very professional I remember I pergi err the not kedung kodek what's that
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching pi mai pi mai tang tu at that time was imuda imuda that there were some people sayang they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform ee apa tu they can really perform macam
buat masa yang berpanjangan tau macam ada stamina is really that atau buat orang macam orang pergi kelantan kelantan they they the people doing dikir barat
they can really do dikir barat the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
uh macam for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs lah
the yang yang lama-lama lah
dia kata orang glamour ada what is that ah
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia dia perform astro punya lah
I think astro punya organise so ya guest judge was
ah tapi dia ada all the the veteran singer so hady was face off with this other
ah so they have this person in the end dia menang dua-dua two of them memang kan
why now you know macam like in a way kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat malaysia you know
ya pasal dia dah then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really menyanyi is really his talent you know
no but macam I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series eh
junior eh yuan ching you tahu you kenal dia was she some
ya zoe tay was from your ni
yuan ching yuan ching yang dekat jurong eh
no but but you had that yuan ching punya alumni yuan ching punya alumni is it yuan ching
yuan ching macam hancing the the yuan ching punya alumni dinner right you eh
err your friends apa ashik eh siapa
amin kan dia orang tak pergi eh
I told you the three of you form a table what with your other friends and sama kelas
now memang susah
cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar jer
is it badan besar rambut putih eh
ya macam macam macam seroja was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
you know to be ya I mean be err get get new more books you know but macam the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just macam seroja
you you are I'm not I'm older than you sayang
ah tu ah si si siapa was telling me these millennials ah because it's
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right mana tengok seroja I tengok kesian ah
dia beli rumah tu about satu point satu satu point dua juta tau
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to uh buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house pun err
uh it's slow down macam orang pun tak nak beli
rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu I think
uh dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual
macam tinggi lah tak nak jual harga tinggi lah she just want to sell uh
ah and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle dekat
her condo tu kan not near the beach right so macam
to her is an effort lah to go back and forth naik basikal di situ and I think a bit ulu lah because situ kan jauh kan
she like cycling but macam
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but macam
for me when I see her I tengok I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
macam is typical of err they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
macam still tinggal that rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual and still have err her she's start to pay ready for her house
no no hers was second hers was a new lepas tu dia kata ada
ah tapi besar because rumah dia belum habis renovate eh because they had to for stall the
uh the no the the macam kira development dah habis semua tapi orang semua I think they nak renovate ah sikit-sikit kan
tapi pasal renovation kena put on hold because of the COVID
so I was thinking to myself oh not bad eh dia tak payah jual rumah in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to jual rumah so maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta I mean she's already nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
maybe she has the money ada duit juga ah
that one betul-betul ada err pool or view of the pool ya
tiga tiga bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice sayang it was like
uh I think I think for dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal condo she shared with a flatmates dulu dia tinggal dekat sekarang dia tinggal kat condo I think she found a new flatmate eh and then macam kat kat russia kan they don't have this quality of
uh so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware lah about the development about about buying condo uh that dasha is aware so macam macam it's very sexy lah
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because dekat itu dekat dengan russian nya embassy
and and then dekat bukit timah dia nak dekat dengan nature agaknya orang putih gitu kan
ah shared dengan ramai ramai ramai
I tak tahu I never ask
uh but I think she like the location agaknya
uh because this mat salleh they like their nature they like
uh dia naik bus dia dia orang naik bus
because maybe the flatmate yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya
they're not really macam kita a bit rude about money we talk about money like macam I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think dasha will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about macam
macam it's not really the thing lah macam us cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual
you tahu this this year I don't see her spending anything dia tak beli baju baru
mungkin dengan boyfriend dia ke apa kita tak tahu kan mungkin ada boyfriend lah
kalau like that okay eh
uh but sami suka
macam dia dia kata dia ada swimming pool kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna kan uh that's fixed to me condo lah
macam some of the aminah punya friends right they tinggal condo ah
uh macam err I guess that's macam we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
yang pak ali eh you know pak ali always get the best grades macam dean's lists lah borhan also the one the radio warna right but they were from it doesn't
macam ya people used to think that err
he was educated sayang he was educated when he was young he was educated in eton tau
did I ask him what did you do he's baba budak orang baba
dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi tuition
dia pergi tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
uh teaching macam he has he has his full time job
even after tu dia continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so macam you know you have this
but he's very nice lah I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time kita because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you berbual and then dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang so most of the time we speak melayu and baba so
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him oh can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me lah of course lah he won't pay for it lah but because it's my mahal right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there dia beli dia ingat I don't know how it is now terrence
no no no dia nak pergi actually tak nak pergi singapore
tapi dia kata dia not good enough lah dasha kata sebab tu eton they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually eton then after that the eton got
a professor but dia orang lah
or american eh but very fluent in russian and then because err project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but macam macam russian only a few know
uh tapi be you know why they go to russia because dia punya tuition fee
singapore I tak tahu but uh
so there were err she was speaking russian to her husband and dia she have two children two or three children they all go to sabah or sarawak then after that yang orang kat belakang dia there's this man ah err medical doctor
dia kata oh he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns err medicine in russia
no but I think is in a hospital in malaysia dia orang recognize
I think wait singapore punya that they have a different different tu ah
because I remember my friend you know yang arwah nadim tu yang meninggal tu isteri dia
belajar medicine dekat kelantan lah if I'm not wrong kelantan also
but kelantan ni banyak
but kelatan punya he he actually don't want to go there he doesn't want her to stay there
tak recognise kelantan punya medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes dia come back
err to be dia kerja kat mendaki kan arwah dia until he very sick already he went over there
um but yang your friend tu siapa
yang your friend tu yang follow kita tu pergi kashmir siapa tu
you know that the hair stylists yang I pergi the hairdresser tu yang pergi kedai cina tu anak perempuan dia tak boleh masuk dekat medicine school dekat singapore so she actually took out a I think two hundred thousand dollar loan
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka australia
ah because dia tak stress lah macam singapore
kan bilang
err so pula dapat keluar pergi luar negeri
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology siapa si
ustazah yang teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example yang daripada
apa eh
it's not considered a degree level macam for example you want to be a teacher right
yes that's what my ustaz told me
so macam it has to be like they recognize degree
jordan I tak tahu
could be ah because mak dia mak dia tak nak but but but uh the ustaz kata that's the reason macam for example kita dapat second upper the second upper uh or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya that's why like people say why they go to madrasah for that's the big question everybody ask
agaknya ah tu
I don't know now err COVID I tak tahu ah
so that's why a lot of people recommend pergi jordan
there's dia orang punya
kan itu hari si king of jordan datang
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like tiga empat daripada eygpt and then she knows other dialect lah so dia kata ada kesian because she was telling me because dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz
ustaz hasan so dia bilang ah dia bilang dengan I lah some of them come from negeri yang you know they come from kampung so only know dialect tau dia orang tak tahu so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend ah
and this lady have a condition ah dia kata then I ask err your cousin eh how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into eh a'ah kak tini bukan senang you know like nak kena ni nak kena surgery nak kena ni can you imagine nak kena like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap lah nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people agaknya derma I think embassy derma agaknya and then spend money on them you know err spend the money on translations err these translators
oh ya because the the king would err hussein not hussein I I I kenal bini dia uh he was very impressed the singapore side very cepat very efficient
but when I was telling doctor ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia showing off
uh that is the rumour lah that she tunjuk the jam
ya but it's also something that has strength lah because her fusha is very good like the orang arab dengar fusha lah yang I try to berbual dengan ustazah hadijah
itu fusha but okay so macam the the difficult dialect is not egyptian lah according to them lah but I don't know I tengok egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt punya dialect very near fusha the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
banyak orang arab banyak kan very diverse
dia tinggal kat egypt itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama she even take she even take talaqqi courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take talaqqi she taught she taught me how to tajwid
she told me yang the and then when I ask abi abi say betul
ada yang ustaz yang famous sampai boleh kalau you buat salah your bacaan sampai boleh ambil you know your you know the what is that thing ah
when they collect the smoke the cigarette punya ashes leh
like garang ah
let her bukan poly tak boleh pakai tudung pakai jer tudung kat poly
or you want her to go okay lah go pakai then there's the other thing lah
I think err tengok appetite dia macam math and science
in singapore you cannot do well macam
macam I don't think so lah
err namanya
tak tahu ah I just tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat lah but she's very close to murni so now she's the
punya translation unit she she's the head you know
pasal I selalu berbual dengan dia
then I made her watch asian alida bahasa melayu I even I even err
gunakan err
apa tu penterjemahan eh
penterjemah subtitle ah dalam bahasa melayu
dia suka ah mula-mula tak suka mula-mula tanya apa mak maknya tu kau tak sayang nyawa kau eh you know the cerita ejen ali kau tak sayang nyawa kau
no I think pasal dia dia daripada kaku dia macam kaku but the my mum was very impressed that dia menonton filem tanggang eh dari awal hingga akhir so I said what's happening you know
anak going
tapi tapi dia suka dia suka tengok my computer ah
okay kita punya ni nak tamat sayang
but she also get shares which I am I think she her limit is three to four hours after that she like okay don't need computer pun takpe ah she has this limit ah
I think in really should learn I know kata takpe sekarang ni tengah tengah waktu akhir dah dah peperiksaan dah berakhir pun masih masih nak belajar I said no lah no nothing belajar I said this is like membaca buku

today eh today lah kan si kakak ajak keluar hari ni dia kata tak nak
eh then si affaf macam mana sekolah dia tu
sekarang what we hear lepas tu ada kata start january ada start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
err tu lah I mean the the the
correspondents tu macam last time when I go melbourne study kan
in seoul is one of the agency other agency pun ada so like this uh uni oh kaplan one of it is there any other agency
uni mana apa buat
but if there's no choice how rasa if
the one that those without the apa is without the examining examination tu macam mana
so nak kena ambil I mean it's the same
if she opt to other macam early childhood
can she use the diploma or tak boleh pasal dia tak bridging
ya example kalau oh this one ada the next one is this one is uh no not examinable
that's two lah satu sama ada dia nak ambil with examinable
and also must know whether the diploma if she has tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi kan
cause if she wait again dah she waste one year ni dia wait again tiga bulan
I thought she say dia punya sekolah macam
career gardens apa
is different course now this the uni is still exist lah I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more kenapa low intake ke
but the thing kalau macam because now pun she take the bus pun she will pay adults fee just no school pass kan
mm waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that baik go to other place seh
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out nanti tak tahu lagi
this is kaplan tukar dia punya uni kan with these courses
can check online tak
cause now is limited time eh sekarang dua puluh plus
I her other friends sekolah mana private mana
kaplan juga bukan
with her behaviour seram
your lifestyle lah kan macam
campur-campur orang okay uh jaga diri
because suasana lain tau suasana part malaysia suasana part suasana part
ada tau ah
tu lah yang si ustaz anak dia kan remember murdoch apa yang ustaz salim pun kan you just uh go over to malaysia lah rather than go
what you can when uh other uni other places kena start dia punya tu kan then from there
kalau kata recognise that's a plus point lah kan I mean singapore to malaysia tu wah one more year
tapi tak ada uni photography eh ada ke
cari apa tu lah you you you sign up with uh intern at Sony
uh ya yang yang yang resale ah resale of
post apa post recruit people
anak tiga tu eh
is it matters if you plot english and english and maths lain english lain
uh uh you I think tak payah you can just put a survey K put a survey
ah now SAM ada new uh so called syllabus come out for english
are you if you are offered are you interested to be uh enrolling your son ke gitu lah kan
from there then you see kalau ratio dia only about ten percent
tengok uh I don't know how you I mean you can limit to one class lah kan
kalau ramai orang healthy response then you can consider open kalau tak healthy then
better ya cause we don't want need to to be up to student the student then one teacher I mean you buat habiskan duit on that
no I didn't do anything tak ada your one
I tak buat apa-apa
dia suspend
suspend jap
so what you saying is what oh ya english if both english uh she can ajar english dengan melayu eh english dengan melayu
english and maths then is much better lah then for si apa tu si
the tutor tak jadi eh no no the uh chinese boy is one thing lah kan this thursday jumpa you kan si yang yang keng kok
eh so post post ke
or no partnership you can say lah is difficult administration susah I either want to
nanti at the end kita bergaduh susah safe

dia tak payah become funder ah because macam

apa yang tu I mean we can change lah apa yang
tapi I
kita nak dia to be a chinese kan kalau dia is a eurasian
ada patient tak ah we're going to wait for what what what
but if the children going tak tahu juga seh
then then you ask him about you are staying juga eh ah about journey travel
dia tak is his ah
dia graduate ke apa
kalau kan dia ni main intern teaching long time lah dia mengajar
just now you say I'm just from something is it his uh secondary school kat mana
itu jer bahasa melayu yang awak tahu
so now he kerja part time part time ni lah full time lah
okay lah dia dah tanya you tak tahu kalau dia
but eh ya lah but the thing is kalau he is okay I willing to do these two hours first kan
his is dia punya rezeki dia lah kan if you don't want to be
in situation yang menyusahkan oh okay nak terus okay jer
but the thing is uh dia dah approach lah whether he is the type yang I tengok dia badan besar
kalau dia is the funny guy apa macam you know he can uh communicate with the kids ya first he's a guy kan
kids semua suka girls ladies
gitu ah if this guy is that one that uh can communicate uh friendly then he's it lah kan
we might just uh end of the contract lah kan macam tu lah

uh apa tu last week did you watch the soccer game
tottenham siapa eh I think
dengan siapa I don't know who then um gareth
ya then we won apa eh jap let me check the score I think it was like
ya but it was like macam last minute was like a last minute goal ya
ya nasib but we needed it because after the
second was apa eh can't remember ah maybe like
everton ke apa I don't know and then uh but only for like half an hour they were top cause they had a match with um wolves dengan
but you had school or memang takde
oh then but sampai bila
your macam when's the deadline
rabak pe
then um oh that time you mentioned kan ah yang you nak pergi tu
but okay so if borders buka pergi tak
cause sometimes like even borders buka like still doesn't mean that you know can go right
but dah buka borders belum it's still closed
but anyway um I just found out yang the international business students in my course
uh they are supposed to I think in their like third year they're supposed to go to lah to to study abeh sekarang border closed right and also the cases rising kan
then I think cause I didn't know that we have another campus kat dubai
ya I didn't know that ya so then I heard lah macam I don't know if it's true or not macam the students will go there
that's why macam tak
that's why macam like tak dengar at all right about dubai like corona cases ya so
but lucky I'm not student ah cause anyway if in in any cases macam both tak buka or both not accepting like foreigners then you waste your money right
I remember that aku teringat there's this um guy in my primary school macam he he's from new zealand ah
ya tapi dia mix macam cina ah dia cina dengan
so last time aku ada this whatsapp group
and also last time my english wasn't that good like it wasn't great lah and I like my grammar macam like
uh sembarang right ya then after that
I type something I think I type like macam
he oh sorry I typed if I'm not wrong lah maybe something like she have kan salah right ya
ya then I macam at that point of time I was like rude
a'ah mak dia masak tak lah we ordered food
ya then she was like oh malas then I was like okay lah fine just order jer
okay lah I think that time also aku dua minit abeh aku hit curb abeh dia like terus suruh balik
ya mine also mine was smooth also macam
ya or not confirm like lambat gila
ya and the pakcik
I don't know I think dia penat
uh like some allied educator dekat but it's under ah ya
it's outdoor activity macam outdoor outdoor learning ya
belum she just went for the english test
but I think the english test should be final macam like the final round I guess ya then she will know lah ya
ya then kalau she nak ajar kat secondary then kena ambil degree ah ya
I suddenly macam nak apply for
at first macam
tak my ambition eh dengar my ambition like when I was younger was to teach macam like ya like I always know oh maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout mm secondary school poly macam okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why macam I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
so macam like what you do
oh okay so macam for example
so for for example macam okay you like a company wants to manufacture food ah so they will come to people like you is it
oh faham faham
macam niche lah right ya baik ah
oh anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right macam
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know macam ambil duit abeh balik ya
as in nursing belajar nursing
but to be honest macam just take one thing at a time ah
ya I mean and she baru start kerja
exactly abeh nak ambil nursing
but it's tough lah I mean it's ya it's banyak nak kena fikir
no as in aku tahu ah
not in the in that regard but macam
don't know kalau don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
so did you apply for the for the madrasah course
ilmu ilmu apa eh pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat ah gitu
and kebanyakan macam orang
duh but orang muda ya macam our age ah
it's not a syarahan it's really macam kau belajar buku like all the buku tak tahu lah dia like macam ada banyak banyak buku
kitab sure like okay sure ya
but interesting lah ya macam some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
macam sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting ah and the ustad funny
macam he's like the abang-abang type dia macam just buat kelakar ah like every single every single lesson
not we are not rapat lah but macam
as in like it's not like we talk everyday ke apa
ah ya like ya we are just no but serious macam in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other lah ya
because macam not that productive
oh abeh
it's recorded ya so macam what's the point
if you wanna sit in abeh some of the students tanya banyak soalan and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching uh one of the videos kan as it dia macam just tanya for like like twenty minutes non stop
abeh lecturer dia boleh layan and he's a he's an old man lah so of course lah macam I think dia macam like
ambil hati and he would he will also macam just jawab lah all of apa dia punya questions
ya so ya it's damn unproductive lah but then again macam if go back on campus lessons only like tiga jam
but malas ya and jauh jauh seh tempat dia
but I tried going to campus before aku naik train
ya abeh kena stop ah dekat
ah boleh ah no
lupa ah lupa
tak pernah pergi but that time once I went there aku stop dekat I think bugis
err tak I stop at bugis abeh tukar
ya duh takkan I stop at bugis sia abeh kena naik bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like kalau my apa my kakak dapat then my dad will belikan kereta
just change ah macam siapa siapa like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no lah for what balik ah
ya fikir ah
but jauh naik public bus
satu kat kan
abeh the other one
but tadi I not tadi lah the other day I took train macam semua orang like rapat-rapat
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin macam they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think belum lagi phase two then they remove
macam just because like oh decrease ye ye o jer abeh tak ye ye o seh
mm kat mana
no tak cause that time I like aku lapar gila at like two and I want to order ah abeh like closed ya
no like macam ya
it has been right ya I get I think macam cause COVID abeh dia orang tukar
but that time aku pergi raimah dengan kawan aku
malam ah ya and it was like damn crowded then I was like oh I should have known ya
no but uh dia nak lepak that's why ya
then where macam like kat rumah kau ada tempat makan
but ya your place macam takde tempat like makan right
oh kopitiam macam masih ada apa
kat like your area
oh oh takde macam mama mama shop gitu eh oh
then besok kau buat apa
eh lah kau buat
oh wait so it's macam ah grab oh
ya but I think aku macam now that I'm schooling tak payah kerja ah
because susah apa
penat and also I'm not doing well in school
it's not I punya tak tahu jaga masa ah ya
not continue but like macam
aku rasa macam like everyone
macam lepak kat rumah all then so you don't feel guilty that you are doing the same
I don't know kemas rumah serious macam every single day I just like kemas rumah
like macam satu dua hari abeh macam last
no lah but now aku try ah macam exercise
no because macam okay that time I remember I was like
ya then my like my muka breakout seh macam
ya my muka breakout then also macam
ya right tadi you keluar
macam that's important
um ya nak besok
start sekolah
start oh tak
kan ikut time macam ya
dia orang ikut ah dia orang punya punya
I don't know I don't think so takde pun
I'm curious now how come takde eh
then your school macam usually is it two weeks
baik pe
penat seh I didn't know uni was this difficult
macam in like after after I finish working lah that
kan abang aku tinggal kat situ ya like macam just visit dia ah
tak um brisbane
ya but boleh drive to gold coast ah ya
but uh on the left or right dia punya driving
ayah aku just uh apa drive ah kat situ ya
and it quite easy macam I see lah I think it's quite easy
kat singapore tak boleh
kat singapore tak boleh
ada pe
sentosa ada pe
tak tahu rope eh
dekat kallang ada
oh ya life jacket kau nak pakai life guard
yes I did yang my dad even showed me a photo
are you serious seram pe
ya but I read somewhere macam
let's not look at western countries as like good places that like we can retire or stay you know what I mean macam ya
no I ya I ask her no I think I was like telling her lah macam oh I'm not so sure what I want to do with my life then she was like okay do you want to stay in singapore or like overseas
and then she was like okay for me I know that I don't want to stay in singapore that's why I study in cause I think she have plans lah to stay there ke apa
and I was like oh okay cool I mean bapa kau ada duit lah so boleh hantar kau belajar luar negeri
because macam our like surrounding countries like asian countries
macam for what
ah it's it just doesn't make sense to me macam
as in macam safety
and also macam when you settle down obviously macam you have family education here is much more better
much more better eh much better singlish betul
tak tahu ah dia orang nak relax ke
ya I think honestly I think they just macam nak that like macam kampung kampung ya they just want that ya that kampung vibes honestly
but my dad always like wish that he has a kampung to go back to
ya but I don't have but I do have like macam
um apa malaysian relatives lah then when we visit them during hari raya or whatever but now since like COVID cannot visit them
right macam okay lah
I think dia macam just nak experience not for youtube I think dia memang you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
ya I'm like macam don't post lah if you're living alone quite dangerous what
you know what I mean macam any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but berani ah dia tinggal kat kat hutan
probably ada apa permit ya
masak ah kat rumah mak kau suruh masak kat rumah tak nak
I I don't know ah for me macam aku tak suka um
but I don't know ah macam
western but macam I don't know
ya but europe macam quite dangerous now right ya
mm kalau I mean like
ya and the country also macam is it easy
but like like I said macam religion is the most important part lah so macam kalau
aku boleh like beribadah
but as in like he's he's okay lah gatal
guys kelakar or not
like macam he recognises the fact that he needs to relate to his audience
rabak seh
damn rabak
ya and then macam
ah best friend dia
I don't know but they say tottenham ada chance
but I don't want to jinx it to be honest because every time macam the fans cakap oh macam eh kita boleh menang abeh like always something else happens
and liverpool oh and also liverpool ada banyak players injured
so I think right macam this is a good time for other teams to step up
ya serious and like if they don't macam it's just a waste
see tengok man U is fourteen in premier league
jap aku ada extension
kau memang itu uh I mean do you subscribe to premier league
oh wait so now takde match ah
ya I just I just perasan
ada lah
ya of course ada
abeh kau menang eh babe sorry what
oh yang kau uh
tepi jalan kan
as in like they abeh ada satu pakcik tolong kau right ya
oh abeh kau lambat
tak I don't think so I think that's memang and it makes sense ya
park the bus lagi
oh okay kesiannya
oh sedihnya
tak nak join ah
takpe lah
kakak kalau ada three wish kakak nak wish apa
a'ah lah kalau apa-apa jer wish dia
so macam top up gitu ah
macam magic gitu
err kalau ada wish eh
first wish nak kahwin ah kot
tapi kalau takde boyfriend pun takpe suami dah jadi
going to three months kot
okay lah dia macam probation period dah rupa gitu
so far belum ah
baru tadi oh
mm I mean we still meet ah just pakai mask and stuff
kita actually meet twice a week seh
ah tak serik lah
uh I met his ibu like oh my god nervous uh I call her for now I call her cik dulu lah cik cik suka makan apa cik suka western ke suka indian ke
uh cik cakap apa-apa jer
tak lah tak tak tak kita pergi kat Al-Ameen woodlands
memang nak jumpa dia ah uh uh so actually it was supposed to be earlier but then bapa dia tak kasi like the bapa don't let the mum go out so then only on friday then the bapa let then okay alhamdulillah then I nervous like heck sia
uh so mak dia jer tahu uh uh
sebab dia tak rapat dia cakap he doesn't even talk to his brothers that much then never really go out then I'm like does your brothers know then like ya
tapi kita berbual sampai malam-malam then every time he'll be like I think my brothers sus me already
then I'm like kalau tahu tahu lah
ya sama
mm mm so far takde alhamdulillah like also because right
so like I read up that it was like uh macam satu adventurous and then satu lagi practical like bila sama-sama dia bagus and dua-dua macam bara api gitu jadi macam passion gitu lah
I don't know ah I don't know belum lagi ah so ya so ya but I forgot our I forgot our chinese zodiac
api jer eh
ah tapi tak lah tak lah garang sangat kan
to betul-betul macam
I macam lagi dua ke tiga gitu I pun terlupa around there lah
I think so lah tapi I think his is at most four years gitu
electric engineer eh electrical engineering ah gitu-gitu ah
uh tapi like
he was telling me also lah like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life gitu so takde direction gitu so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
thought that err because dia punya poly punya course takde exam
so he thought maybe ada exam lagi senang gitu then he thought like maybe like even without macam passion he can still macam buat lah macam survive gitu but then apparently he's like not surviving very well
ya but then he say he finish exam first lah sebab besok dengan besok besok ada
ada exam
if you ask me I say go ahead lah macam if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
ah baru twenty five seh
as from engineering dengan engineering gitu kan
oh boleh macam tu eh
ada strategy tu
macam investment kot I don't know lah eh
tak that's the thing like macam he knows
that he like suka and he wants to do like research in the industry gitu but he don't know where to start and how to get there gitu
uh uh that's what I told him also like that's the first thing I ask macam asal tak pergi digipen like why not then after he say eh I got search for that
then go electrical engineering baru eh
ya ya ya I nak minum air
kerusi aku ni pusing ah
macam suruh dia pergi course counselling ah
I am not the right person to ask also siapa lah aku kan
tak tahu bila lah but some day inshallah
ya lah ya lah ya lah tak ada minat kan
ya sebab sekolah lama seh like you you school like continuously right
mm the macam the momentum kan
so sekarang ni twenty twenty jadi next year
uh huh two a'ah betul two
entah lah tengok dulu lah lepas kahwin kot
and I have no pressure to get married so dia macam so you know what don't stress
lepas kahwin baru fikir ya
once your suami is okay with it then like if anybody else says right you can just like kau siapa suami aku cakap okay apa
uh uh kau siapa
maybe in two to three years then I'm like okay lah kau fikir dulu lah
because to me it's not about the duration is not about macam oh lepas dua tahun nak kahwin oh lepas tiga tahun nak kahwin no it's more like
that's why cause kahwin tak senang seh
ya sia mahal seh
ya exactly and then then during your wedding already people like oh your wedding going to be besar ain punya nanti besar-besar tau then I'm like siapa cakap siapa cakap a'ah I'm like excuse me
exactly eh suka hati jer main cakap jer
uh uh malangnya
mm maybe not necessarily lah my perfect wedding will be dekat kampung ah makan ulam-ulam semua
maybe kampung kat buangkok ke
ada yang satu dekat buangkok ah pulau ubin ke mana tahu weh kan best
ya I know habis pulau semakau pulau tekong
ya but I would I would rather have like a wedding at pulau ubin eh like siapa tak nak pergi pulau ubin okay tidak dijemput bagus filter filter
a'ah ah bukan tak jemput tapi korang tak nak datang betul tak betul ah bagus
ya ya it's okay ah this one macam plus minus lah mm mm
ya I mean I've seen people get married at tuas so I'm like siapa nak pergi tuas
ya so bagus ah siapa takde motor tak boleh datang
a'ah bagus tidak dijemput
uh uh uh uh dia dia saja jer
ke hujung eh
kirim salam sampaikan salam nak kasi duit PayNow takpe
uh uh zaman sekarang semua dah PayNow
but ya it like sebab kalau drive dari luar kan nampak dia punya
nama dia seafood restaurant so I don't know whether they like the building is owned by the seafood restaurant or like they do it at the seafood restaurant itself ya
sentosa mahal
go harbourfront go batam terus
feels like that eh rasa macam gitu ya it's like because
dari sentosa kan I always see all this ferry go to batam kalau lah boleh naik satu feri tu kan bagus
best juga tu
mm best apa
habis wallet
tu dia punya tu tight sikit dia punya schedule dia tak boleh lambat
mm mm ya like jangan nak janji melayu eh janji melayu kapal dah jalan eh please eh
ah lepas tu orang lepas tu kalau makcik makcik semua dah lambat habis semua orang muda dekat terus kan habis clubbing terus
tu bachelorette party seh all out seh
uh mocktail ada mocktail ada ya
ya it's a rooftop bar very nice ya me and adik went
you should I mean it's not cheap lah but like ya mm mm it's just strange because it feels like a nice place to for a date but I came with my brother instead so I'm like mm okay ya I went with adik
ya because right we wanted to get the very nice looking drinks and you know macam instagrammable gitu ah but then when we went
it was a like a brunch punya promotion I think uh brunch menu so it was like a buffet instead so I'm like okay lah
free flow macam barbecue then there's also free flow like telur nak omelette ke scrambled egg ke apa burger uh it's very nice but the I remember like everything was nice you know the
pasta you can choose your sauce chilli crab ke nak aglio olio ke apa uh then
uh and then the tacos I didn't try but then adik said it was nice
when I went then the there's like it comes with like a main so I bought the main and it was very nice it's some seafood soup something like that then you cecah dengan roti
uh but then paling best tu barbecue barbecue dia
cause like the sotong and the ikan and the ayam
tak dia barbecuekan dia macam counter kita just
of all things kan ada sotong ada sausage mm okay ada ayam then you know what was there
but I don't know maybe kita tak tahu makan or something lah maybe we just don't know how to eat lah cause we didn't like it ah very much
it tasted like meat you know then I'm like what is this it's very strange ya but then the good part also ada tempat solat
sebab ada banyak benda-benda kan
oh pahit eh
it's just it's just hilarious lah cause every single time then hazim will be like nak pergi staycation then I'm like what me and you
ajak him first
kekek seh
but I don't know whether abang hafiz will be okay with him and if he will be okay with abang hafiz also
can you imagine abang hafiz with another abang hafiz okay then you just put that in mind
think in the end eh in the end they will just like abang hafiz will call you and then hazim will call me like
tapi voucher belum lagi dapat
uh because tak ambil leave mm
baru boleh ambil leave
ya cause now also I need to take leave then tengok budak-budak sekolah ke tak
ya cause dorang deaths I mean not deaths lah but like dorang punya cases like macam tak terjaga jer
mm mm did you see the numbers everytime umi right like whoa wah malaysia punya numbers naik then I'm like umi
it's always because of like macam
tak lah like the whole show I think wasn't that macam
cautious about it dorang macam tak berhati-hati nak ikut rules tau
and then people are saying like that's only the one that's tested then the one yang tak tested
ya and their country also not that develop like especially macam tengok the medical facilities and stuff kan dalam the hospitals semua tu
it's the culture lah like dorang tak macam
gabra sangat lah I will say ya that's why
ya lah macam conspiracy theory lah
I mean in an emergency and pandemic like this kadang-kadang cannot help it
terpaksa you know because of the resources that they have and stuff like that
so macam it's sad but
terpaksa ah
mm entah lah eh kalau orang tua kita yang paling degil kot macam dorang yang selalu lawan why cannot why cannot wear then after that nanti dorang yang
dorang yang selalu marah-marah orang tau I always see you know all those like boomer whatsapp video then always send one right
then it's always it's always the older population tau is always they are the one that is scolding yang budak-budak muda then budak-budak muda pun nak cakap apa
just follow the instructions government cakap tak boleh government cakap if you don't do this fine three hundred dollar not I say one I say not I say one this one governments say one ya
wah and then there is me I was at choa chu kang interchange okay I was waiting for hazim you know I was waiting for my boyfriend and then and macam cause I came early what dah siap kan jadi duduk dulu lah kan you know dekat drop off
err when you drop off ada kerusi-kerusi gitu
so I duduk situ at the drop off area duduk dulu lah tengok TikTok ke apa dulu ah
tengah lepak-lepak habis lepas tu sebelah like
then after that kita macam kita pakai mask kita tak kita tak berbual pun dalam I didn't even notice she was there I swear
then I was just like tiktoking then after that suddenly this group of aunties right like I don't know where they came from also tapi tiba-tiba dorang datang tau like this group of like five aunties I think they came then after that uh dorang macam berbual-bual at this area like very near me ah beside this aunty was sitting so I think they were one group
like one big group tapi cuma ada satu tempat duduk so dia duduk lah
ada lima orang then satu aunty tengah duduk jadi agaknya enam lah tu tak tahu I ni macam primary school maths gitu
ya but then jap jap jap jap I haven't belum habis lagi and then right so he halau them already like kesian this aunties you know they just like there talking they tried to adhere to as many rules as possible already they just want to talk you know then uh uh
like they not even like like not wearing not even spitting or anything you just you know speaking you know tengah berbual-berbual jer seh
after that dorang jalan lah maka terpaksa mereka jalan
this aunty who's sitting dia macam tengah macam lengah-lengah lah nak duduk-duduk because baru duduk tau baru duduk
the pakcik came to me
sejak bila aku tak boleh duduk kat kerusi then I'm like
err okay ah okay then I just like perangai sia then after that I I just left lah like my mood no good already lah then the the aunty who was
sitting at the other seat right then she look at me walk I think she wasn't planning to walk but because I walk right then she look at me then she's like aiyo semua also everything also cannot now semua pun tak boleh then I'm like
a'ah nak buat macam mana aunty takpe lah
tak nak kena saman so ya
I'm telling you ah if we don't wear if you never wear mask and someone sampai sekarang eh the one person sneezed and that person is let's say positive eh
liao satu I'm telling you it's gonna have COVID already
ya so it was dah nak kat satu tahun ah oh my god ya sia
wah cepat seh
then after that only because of that kan only sebab uh of this kan then like
dorang punya living conditions got raised up as well which I think is a positive side effect of this I mean I'm not gonna say that it's a good thing but there are some positive side effect is like one of them is like this macam dormitory is only now baru tahu oh dulu kan dorang tinggal then after that I was thinking
cause kalau tak siapa tahu eh like when was the last time you actually lap itu benda punya handle like I don't know ya so I feel like it's a good reset in a sense lah
when when I was like when I use the soap and I wash wash like betul-betul punya wash like scrub scrub you know the eight step gitu kan
be like what she doing why you wash until so clean like but then ada lah aunty yang cute lah cuba ikut juga lah
macam ya but ya now they don't
ya ya ya is like ya I mean that's why I say like I think there's positive side effects also lah I mean it's not a good thing but you know if you think about it another way mm mm ada lah hikmahnya
so macam kadang-kadang like weekly she will ask us lah so how's your COVID situation when we're like oh it's getting better here you know
cause orang tak ikut orang sana tak ikut rule
like it's a law tapi dorang tak enforce sangat
lepas tu selenga I don't know lah I think
have the whole the whole island eh the whole singapore tengah geram dengan dia
check check that one time eh satu kali
it's just that everybody was just wondering macam sejak bila boleh dua belas orang
kalau phase three pun lapan orang jer
mm tapi
in all honesty at least they jujur but actually saya ada dua belas orang lah that time you know even though you might get saman or what but
ya at least dia come clean
kita sejujur-jujurnya eh are we even as careful as we were las time kan
oh my god how macam mana tu
macam gitu eh bilang orang tak payah makan sudah
ya it's basically tak masuk akal
I'm like nak cakap pun fikir sikit ah like
I I think even a secondary school kid boleh fikir that um even kalau macam situational writing eh I wouldn't come up with this
it's a mood it's a mood dia tinggal dekat uh
oh itu jauh babe jauhnya ya allah
and then yes nak try sangat ah try dua-dua sekali lah
why not and so entah macam dah try dua dua dah cukup ah
dah dan rasa okay lah dah dah puas then I I
um cari jodoh cari jodoh who is next
I was like please please kakak you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour
no no no no no no sabar sabar no no okay so the the um
I downloaded for her Muzmatch kan can so we just wanted to see how the app works right and so like we never put anything about her tau like macam
gambar nama jer like we never add in anything in her bio her profile or whatsoever and then after that um
err upload lepas like bila-bila masa ah
tak payah terus upload
yes ya you try you can just try now after that lepas tu like she just delete but then she still receives like emails from cross match cause it doesn't entirely
delete your account it just delete like it just delete the apps on your phone lor then macam the account is still there there's something about you what
kalau let's say you nak nampak more calon kan
he was cute he was cute tapi kan
orang-orang kat sana kan is really looking for
in dia punya database include international people
macam like
yes what what is that yes tapi kena bayar
to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch tak payah
like I'm not the kind who superficially macam oh if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
no lah I mean sometimes dia orang K when I say dia orang serious kan it's like dia orang betul-betul serious want to put themselves out there
ya like it really just depends on your rezeki I guess
ah itu lah
oh ya ya ya ya but like first date you terus want to pergi trekking
sebab you duduk side by side
jangan date orang gatal
okay ya I agree with you pasal the movie like
kalau tengok movie tak boleh berbual and then you
buang masa like if it's a date like like first date you know that you buang masa like dua jam tak berbual then like
if you going out to makan and everything
uh no I feel like trekking nanti um
macam very superficial ya first ideal date ah I feel like
and then like dia orang masak sendiri you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like oh ya it's so cute
the mat tikar flat lay yes yes yes yes
ya so macam if you think like those cerita like or like I don't know like macam
but what if like the guy betul-betul macam very disgusting very rude
um so I I suddenly remember pasal you did you watch the smart local ya
by um catfish K catfish tu bukan kucing ikan okay tapi so basically like
ya do you watch like the netflix punya ha what's the
and then they will have like conversations bukan bukan it's not a cerita it's like dating reality
sekejap eh
many couples right only two got married tak salah I
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates dia orang dah beli you know
so it was about this article about this um malay muslim lady who decided to make halal mooncakes because
there are a lot of halal mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
dia orang tak sedar diri oh my god
then kalau let's say kalau kita bilang dia orang kan oh
korang ada chinese privilege or whatever kan dia orang macam
kecil hati oh mana ada mana ada korang korang ni just oversensitive lah
I pernah ada kawan ni
dia tak percaya chinese privilege exists in singapore
tak tahu because is is okay
so dia betul-betul tak percaya tau chinese privilege exists
habis dia dia buat this long twitter thread pasal
it doesn't exist pasal oh um
budak-budak melayu tak bayar school fees untuk sekolah it's very very cheap compared to budak-budak lain
dia betul-betul usaha tau untuk
it's uh uh oh my god when I read it I was like K lah buang masa jer lah I baca tak ada apa-apa it's okay thank you very much
so kesimpulannya
awak a'ah yang
tak kisah pasal um
I think like dulu um
thursday asal
interview like the teaching like the macam mana
for a lot of times sebelum final like final year lepas dia dah graduate baru dia orang terima dia
kalau tak selepas dia cuba tiga empat kali tak salah
like setiap tahun dia cuba
oh bukan
medium or kecil
oh tak ya
oh tiger no tiger besar ah ee
cute gila
oh ada
oh is it the kind that you duduk dalam haiwan ya ya ya ya I think that's better honestly
kita orang yang patut dalam this cage sangkar
sejuk eh dua minggu lepas
err I pergi river safari with my family
boring to be honest uh is like the word like it it was kind of dumb cause kita orang kena bayar
untuk masuk the boar rides five dollars
they don't have the crews anymore so then the boats then kita orang pergi naik it just like a short it's like macam
ya kita kena bayar five dollars but besides that everything is like
kai kai masih makan jumpa makan makan makan
habis dia makan ya
so dia pun pregnant lah
oh ya dia makan banyak tau tapi yang the pregnant
ya so then the apa tu err
err kai jia kai kai kai kai dia asyik makan tau dia habis makan satu bamboo stick panjang kan
selepas tu dia dia crawl dia ambil lagi lepas tu dia patahkan dia makan lagi
the whole time dia just makan tau I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god dia orang cute gila
uh apa tu apa tu kucing and also you know those macam couple couple buat video
no it's not it's because kita orang asyik tengok some videos pasal couple couple so the algorithm just
macam sedih kan
ya but like I feel sometimes dia orang post benda yang
should have just kept it to themselves macam something not everything other people should be
like something are just so intimate macam I recently saw this video pasal

she I beli her using my own money you know my own duit my hati my buah hati my baby boo tak payah lelaki dah just you got a new laptop life's great baby
you didn't do anything the entire day so perangai lembu lah
perangai what
okay perangai babi then
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I mata potek or like orang Apple mata potek I do not know like I genuinely don't know
so now officially girl girl is broke I dah tak ada duit I nak makan pun tak boleh you know I was like thinking of buying like
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke apa lan jiao kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa
lepas tu I
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like dulu kan my mum pakai tudung
so like dia pakai tudung then kalau dia nak potong rambut kan nak kena pergi to somebody's house you know to tutup aurat and all that lah
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit lah but like raya have to go to their house cause it's like some nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya some shit lah
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to pakai tudung in primary school my mom brought me there lah instead of like the normal kedai barber and all that
since fucking primary six sampai last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to jadi dia punya
daughter-in-law dalam bahasa melayu apa
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously menantu material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her menantu for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her menantu you know dulu right when I was like like twelve nanti benda dia macam kecil jer ah macam she will be like
orh like what do you think of my anak like that like nanti aku duduk like dia kasi aku makan nanti dia cakap you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
um she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2 then I'll be like like apa kau merepek like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I don't know about you ah but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and salam dia punya mak lah cause like I don't know why
then I have to salam the mum then
I salam dia nya mum and then straightaway dia punya mum was like
err kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua
huh sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau and I was just confused you know I was just like
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I sayang you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri and then like he's never there
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year raya and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading ah
like I tudung and all that
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son kau nak jadi aku nya
menantu ke tak that that happened last year lah but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the menantu that's all
kan I don't know it's just like a melayu nya thing
like makcik makcik be really all up in your face be like kau nak jadi aku punya err menantu ke tak
menantu like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good menantu quality like
especially if makcik got a son that is like freaky
makcik I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now
you nak I sekarang tak I umur baru dua puluh tapi okay dah
I okay I budak uni
I don't know what else to say I budak uni
I suka masak
like I don't know what is a good quality to be a menantu in the first place
is it so that means what when you just register straightaway kau pergi primary one like you cannot skip anything is it
tak ah the only the only madrasah that I had went to was Andalus and then it was only until like what
so I go and boleh pukimak kau dia tak tahu ke
oh my god bodoh lah so the only vocab that he knows in Malay is
and like adjectives like sedap
and lawa
gila ya the jiwang kind of shit but then doesn't actually understand what's going on
oh no the motivation is gone padahal nak cari ilmu eh okay okay sorry sorry
like I solat I got clear skin I got good grades
it is scan scan tu eh
ah lepas tu
so wait he got he tunang in twenty seventeen he putus tunang in twenty seventeen and then he go and find her again
you know you'll never know might like still sayang and like I don't know like
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to berak then you don't want to berak first and then it's just like
I don't know nak cakap childish ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham sia
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi lah cari toilet yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya girlfriend cari kan toilet buat apa siak
kay wait kau nya boyfriend jumpa mak kau sebab macam kena caught is it like like terserempak kat somewhere then she's like no
lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
lan jiao I've been together with a guy for one year my mother tak tahu sia
actually I also tak faham lah
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I tak nak main main okay and then suddenly I tak nak main main equals to you kena jumpa mak I
so like I tak faham girl girl tak believe it
I just tak faham I was just like
was the one who told my friend like eh I want to meet your mak
I just tak tahu
like he's not the one that you marry and then korang like wah full blown invested like I don't know ah I I was just confused I never would
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend lepas tu buka bank account
sebab nak kahwin like they actually like
dulu I would do it dulu I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
and you know dapat
tell you so messy perangai everybody semua perangai macam sial
I really never tried blue coral my entire life but everytime a Melayu comes by
I never tried it before but like the Melayu right god like the typical like if the Chinese walk pass you know they're gonna be like peach green tea lah the normal milk tea the Malays if they come right jesus christ they're gonna make me do ice blended at the back and be like blue coral smoothie chocolate oreo
the ice blend and I'm just like alamak makcik like I know lah like
or chocolate oreo like you the melayu the makcik be like
I mean KOI punya milk tea already nice
huh why you talking about milk tea and I want sushi so bad like girl girl nak sushi tapi girl girl tak ada duit
why is sushi expensive like why like kenapa
like they come dengan beras
mahal lah but like
nya sushi
shit lah like the sushi at eh not Sushi Express what is it ah dulu at junction eight ada
oh yeah talking about your madrasah
at the start I went to a masjid madrasah for awhile only like
masjid Ahmad Ibrahim
the baju is green colour and then my tudung is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya telur came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow tudung really not cute
the sekolah is in the middle of like a hutan
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku you know it's like maybe I don't know
my yayi and my mum pergi ah pergi to the masjid and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know sekarang I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
they will just say you know lelaki yang cium #Syafiqah#</P2 kat madrasah
you know dia literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my nyai will like talk about it to my mum
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama ah ada orang cium #Iqah#</P2 kat pipi and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my nyai to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a ulu place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my nyai
I cannot believe it ni perangai
bakal nak jadi menantu orang you know this is the perangai that it perangai
ya I almost said mertua this is why I cannot be nobody's menantu when I cannot even say menantu correctly
a'ah sia I cannot believe it that I actually took higher Malay sekarang melayu berterabur
berterabur baby berterabur
boy dia
mana lah aku tahu
like you nak datang rumah I ke tak you datang lah Mai</P2 lah is it
sampai macam gitu sekali ah like nak kena pakai voice note and all
cepatnya dia punya story travel
asal dia tak happy jer ke or what like what what's going on like is she not happy or like
wah shit sia I'm still damn salty about it like can you believe it sampai sekarang sia I'm just like so tilted
motor be like on the road malam malam buta baby who you fetching is it me I pun nak ikut
but really though naik motor is really fun like it's actually really fun
like the last time I naik motor was this guy who fetch me from work
oh wah not bad sia the job like quite chill for me I've been like searching for jobs because like susah lah like I don't know if what I should do with my life right now because I I'm contemplating between like design atau like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of bila nak apa itu bila nak bila got the discount right so um sometimes they will pick a fight lah but like uh uh I'm used to it already they will be like eh today don't have the discount meh you sure or not ya then I like uh
oh my god kesian apa like I okay lah because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the uh aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
ya I also got something like that because ah in we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right dia orang tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
like that means the apa itu the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
then lepas itu err this girl fadreena um I think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay lah I ask her to come join her also I mean join them as well so at first it was like okay ah
and then asked the friend to like teman her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately ah then after that right my friend was alone lah like she was left alone lah
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short mah so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt lah then she my friend like we like how to say ah err like she kena back my she kena back fadreena then fadreena not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like ugh
like uh the boyfriend is quite old not old but like a few years older then she also say about that like what my boyfriend all like old what is your problem then like just cari pasal lah with my friend then ya ya like she think like the whole world revolve around her or what
oh wait i think I saw it was cause if tak salah it was on his instagram still right like the picture of them together but until now he haven't delete meh
the little actions he do I guess like fold the clothes all ya then I saw he also like apa treat treat her right treat her food all sedap seh ya I wanted oh my gosh three hundred it's three hundred
kau serious apa kau serious
ya oh my god it's scary though cause the first thing right dia kan engaged he's engaged and then now he's like what he cannot move on from rachel when he should be like focusing on his wife kan ya exactly
not really toxic relationship lah but like cause now I I think her life is a movie kan like a drama you know no serious cause she got two guys um so right now she's in a relationship like baru-baru jer lah the she apa itu this guy like proposed to her
but not like nak kahwin propose that kind of type but it's like uh girlfriend like will you be my girlfriend ya but then the guy is in so like now she's like thinking whether she should
so now she's like deciding lah I mean she still she loves her current boyfriend now but like to think of having to go through the next two years is also like a bit hard for her so if you are her what apa apa kau akan buat
that time recently I think was just this week lah uh they had a fight then because like my friend right she called the guy because after like uh dia dah at night right they can call already right so she call the guy ah then apparently the guy macam like I don't know why like bingit or something like cranky
the new guy obviously want to beat him up lah it's like really because it's ya like I don't know it's just a bro thing then uh apparently what else ah he got the ex got also like macam maki dia
maki the my friend ya like on a tweet then also wanted to make a thread about my friend but apparently he deleted it so I don't know problem sia ya it was damn problematic ya
oh ya I cannot I cannot sabar so I just watch every week
oh tak as in like for ratings right usually they say ratings is for like we watch on the but for most of us is like we watch on online mah so I think that's why the ratings not as high ya but
from what aku observe ya from what aku observe right it's really like that like every workplace will have that one guy who is tua
like they should look at themselves in the mirror sebelum dia orang nak prey on younger girls like seriously
especially those yang belum legal like that's that's like that's like a crime
burn burn the anak
ya like macam mana kau boleh buat like that to your own own kid sia that's so sad
no uh ya then they say like uh apparently I think either one of the mother or the the boyfriend was taking drugs then it's can also be like the cause of why they killed the child because you know when bila kau ambil drugs right then you won't like know what you're doing that kind of thing
wah so sad oh my god I cannot leh cause you got see or not if you scroll down below right you got see the gambar of the child
ya usually if like terbunuh it's like you the kid is like abused lah like like
no they never say abuse but like um they say she just they she killed the child in like february I think then like three months later then they burn the anak ya
ya then the kawan also like a bit bodoh ah go and help to
ya it's damn sad because like ah the father the the biological father of the the anak right uh was like finding the child but then apparently they said the mother
mm tak kasih tak kasih dia tengok or like tak kasih information about where the child is or what so for like five months I think the father was like finding the child and then end up the child mati
sakit hati sia ya
psycho sial gila sial this girl is gila like gila
aku wah aku embarrassed sia like legit aku macam rasa malu
ya it's not on it's not like apa itu it's not on like purpose it's on purpose ya it's on purpose then I was like wow how can you like put him in a cage all sia and the cage is like a a cage for cats eh not even for like humans or what
they got other anak you know like they they got like the younger siblings leh I think
ya like like those typical macam you know those malay drama right then got the the evil evil fella
hijrah hijrah fund
then uh bastard oh my god itu terus just pergi neraka sial itu oh my god uh
then ya I saw the syed saddiq also oh my god he always kena sial when all the older err ministers you saw the syed
ya that's what I want to say also like because they all like macam oh you must because I'm older than you right so you must respect whatever I say that kind of thing right but end up whatever they say is like really stupid sial like really
a'ah oh my god did you see the kanye mess oh my god I don't know what he doing sial like legit apa dia tengah fikir dalam uh otak dia sekarang
I should just go lah and spend two years in wah rabak pe lima tahun eh kena tunggu
ya like most of them never wear mask and also like I don't believe the cases really like zero in malaysia I I think there's more just dia orang belum report you know when they are sick
ya ah how is he a how is he even a president aku tak boleh I can't I just cannot
oh my god he's so like apa itu macam what's that word uh he's so calculative ah kedekut yes
ya yang birthday surprise
tak salah pe
I mean like dah dah berbual sampai one one plus
so he and his girlfriend dah kat situ then me and my other guy friend
some Marvel Marvel punya like
uh what else I forgot lah what else ada kat dia punya package yesterday I I read together with them then ya lah
you know like my birthday that time macam
is a company yang buat
so this one we do our own ah like small picnic mat some food very macam
that day punya is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
so the the the macam deciding factor is
if the birthday boy bawa motor ke tak
and my guy friend ni yang the non-birthday guy
dapat kereta ke tak he can drive what okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend ah eh like
you you ask him lah go out for once tak yah bawa motor then I say but
because ya he then I say you use lah the excuse kalau pergi Sentosa like
parking mahal then he say but can park at the Seah Seah Im eh he always park there
boleh pass ah
because he did say he did say that uh she did macam bilang dia
my other guy friend cannot get a car kereta bapa dia
what's the plan ah sudah lupa
ah actually if you ask me frankly I prefer kalau pergi Marina Barrage
because dah dekat dengan kedai makan
just just so that macam tak waste time on the road I feel lah
from the other guy he feels that kan macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua if he tak bawa motor
I I lazy lah go through all that apa monorail eh
okay if we go Sentosa we must start like lepas zohor lah that kind
ya but then he has class ngaji so
ya so need to wait he finish ngaji by the time like two already then nak travel all the way to Sentosa three plus
kita kita nya more like museum attraction kind
uh apa eh
the girlfriend say ah sometimes he like penat from so he
then I'm like kalau he penat like you know
he dah biasa buat
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay uh apa you wouldn't believe it we wanna go Tampines hub also naik motor
even though it's like dekat gila
no lapan ratus lebih
to naik motor lah so cannot stop him
so if if he still macam go for ngaji then most likely is Marina Barrage ah cause
macam we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
dia by six sudah tutup I think
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be biar lah
you know the kedai makan dekat sebelah
I've never eaten there right so I ask him agak agak berapa ah kena bayar like how much is the
korang korang makan apa sia dorang beli banyak ah all guys
then she's like eh then I then I told her lah macam
worse come to worst aku beli air jer ah
then she was like kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air jer
yeah I mean if there's simple food like nasi goreng mi goreng I'll buy lah
ah like this type ah macam shell out eh I feel
yeah macam I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask uh mana kau nak makan ah
point ah I will tell them takut like penuh
uh I did say if we go Sentosa tak ya gi Marina Barrage Vivocity area ada pe then he was like tak nak nak makan restaurant atas sikit
Vivo uh that's what I thought hmm then dorang kata apa nak makan apa Mac then I'm like
kenal us lah cause she knows like
ya and she's not like malu malu dengan kita
she she was the one she was the one who said eh korang nak jumpa for dinner tak a few days ago then I was like
nak discuss about this lah
yeah then I was like masa tu I busy
uh we were in the same class tapi kita ada different clique
ah subset ah dia macam
abeh ada smaller group
hari raya ah hmm
the the guy tak suka the same person I don't like
the other guy also don't like tapi dia pandai bermuka
so sometimes raya also he never come then I a bit sad lah cause like I mean like I close with them what then only me and the other guy ada
ya no loss then he say it's okay uh I will go to your house for raya with the other guy lah just the three of us I'm like okay
ya I think hari raya is the only time that whole big group meet
Arshad say in the group uh apa apa kau kalau tak pergi then kita tak nak pergi ah
just go anyway I also bajet lah I spend
ni nak keluar for the birthday anyway I want to spend money right
I also macam don't feel like how I would feel last time I'll be sad if I never I cannot make it you know
I said that then then the the other girls they alah uh apa you never go then macam boring ah
kalau pergi lima orang then that one person won't have a pair if you take rides
no tak pernah pergi
macam company just another person
tapi three three people is still not bad
I told you what dorang kena kena buang kerja
the blue one the kaki tangling
yesterday ah the girlfriend was telling me kau dah naik yang merah

Aisha aku takut Aisha aku takut
ya I told her that then she's like tak betul lah
oh ya I haven't reply ni
cannot tangguh anymore
semalam oh after we talk about the birthday thing we talk about like other things also lah
then she a bit malu ah and then she was like korang tau eh we we know everything
they uh he saw her in school but he wants to kenal kenal with her right
you know you know the line that guy like uh apa guys like to use or like they ah basically he said uh dia the girl that eh hari tu I saw you at

tak ada kau kata like it's not um
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's punya race eh tapi at the same time kau kata like they shouldn't choose so
like kalau
okay kalau kau chindian kan like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial apa tu the quota that one right
cause like kalau this one
dorang dah ramai gila cina
so kalau kau chindian then kau identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
a'ah I I don't know if like we can jual like jual to melayu eh jual to india or not

okay ah I don't want to say selalu cause it's too like absolute but
uh banyak kali
chey dipinggir yes ya yes ya
ya dipinggir is like ah macam jadi outlier gitu kan
um honestly aku rasa
so aku rasa macam
cause kalau tak ada quota ni semua kan confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation ah cause like macam
kau imagine ah woodlands confirm kampung melayu sia woodlands yishun
yishun tak sangat yishun maybe like yishun maybe like chinese a bit ada indian aku tak tahu
eh eh kau takmo
yeah um abeh punggol probably
I don't know macam cina maybe
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so macam all those like private private properties semua kan macam like rumah sebuah sebuah semua
dorang tak ada seh that's why like they can get away with all this like
ah like segregation so it's like in private housing private housing there's like the kau tahu macam dorm
that foreign foreign workers punya dorm so it's like
like ah for workers and from china semua they live together then from india bangladesh semua live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
um expats ah macam those orang putih then they tend to live in like bigger houses pe so there's the macam they are quite detached from our society
eh diam lah eh yes yes

ya and it's a it's very like easy to baca and
easy easy to faham huh it's not love story ah it's like a sahabat
ya kau dah baca ah tu
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners adab lah adab
mm okay look before kita start kan um
uh okay macam mana nak cakap eh um
so macam uh sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana
ten years down the road bila kita dah ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
um macam for example friendship lah macam kita nak buat kawan baru kan
err tahu tahu
inshaallah tak
okay okay untuk aku kan because poli poli aku lah macam what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
macam mana eh um define
my course banyak cliques tau then um in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation kan so macam apa aku observe kan
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is dia orang popular and then they are
macam for me uh in my course most of the cliques yang macam the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people um they
they are closer to people that macam ada good looks semua so macam
so it's very very subjective lah in terms of macam mana dia orang select uh friends and ya and how the friendship last till
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so macam teaching ke uh
ya design ke ataupun like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
it depends beauty macam
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain uh like macam for example for female right they like males macam
the lelaki yang ada certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
aku rasa macam are we talking in like first first
um like kau nak share
okay uh okay untuk aku kan macam if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset sebab macam
uh for me I place I I put more I mean macam macam mana eh my first first
how do you say it macam
uh for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would uh my first check list is like mindset or personality so macam ya because macam
macam mana eh kalau kita uh kita tak
we are into only the good looks then like I said macam in apa ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so macam to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect lah so macam mindset and personality so macam personality and mindset is something that your bring uh macam mana eh it's like since yang kau dah ada personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset um like
macam mana eh what uh your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods uh rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality macam like for example ten years down the road kan kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita when you have your children then like if you
okay uh firstly memang aku ada watak a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly macam
uh memang high punya
dia lebih lawa lah ah
before we go to the next question I want to ask macam
okay okay best ke dalam topic of friendship kan
friendship bila kita buat kawan uh buat
buat kawan for the first time
to me uh in terms of boys or girls I would say girls sebab macam
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like macam their
macam the friendship is base more on macam
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly macam I mean
not to generalize lah macam like boys they generally talk about like
uh apa macam like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya
mm actually for that topic aku pernah lah belajar lah in aku punya course if like
macam what we think is a society it's not like um good but then it's still functioning so
macam is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something lah
rather than to have a society that macam everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of macam they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
disanjung yes yes yes
macam content is it the content they deliver
they they apa tu they are attached more onto the expectation rather than reality
lain macam extra
okay so for fashion um back in those days macam nineties eighties kan
macam the fashion do um I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion mm
err yes based on pictures also lah then yes it's very laid back and macam
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan dengan the fashion trend you know so macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now macam
we have like the uh what the term E-boy E-girl then the uh then the what type of new dress macam hipster hipster so macam
mm so macam
the no um the fashion macam mana eh do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
macam is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so macam do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
oh pasal journey is it
apa tu macam um right now uh
macam mana eh uh so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is macam kau ada banyak kawan then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is um ada ada uh ada value lah then ada macam ada tempat dekat society but someone macam just dia macam apa seorang
then dia macam pentingkan not really pentingkan diri as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care lah so like what what you think of like um this society standard macam ya
that was jodoh seh
we ngam-ngam
and I think for our friendship also um we are not that judgmental like in uh between ourselves so macam
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and kita macam banyak advice each other so so like it's really something
the negative side there's uh society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself lah since beauty was so macam
ada okay uh ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung
mm so it's like full package lah macam good looking very humble also
but I heard okay so that one is um macam kita kirakan macam uh role model yang macam
someone who is err so macam mira filzah dia macam actress kan
western eh uh aku tak berapa tengok
mm okay then for ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam uh pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam in your own
macam those not as
those not popular lah so macam kawan kau
ke or like someone
yang macam dia lawa and very like lemah lembut and all
it's something macam
ya macam uh kan cakap pasal uh apa tu
deen and deen and dunya so macam apa tu dunya means like world lah so macam
dunia tak di akhirat lah so
so macam aku rasa macam sekarang like budak I mean not to generalize okay but like budak-budak sekarang is more
aku rasa macam sebab macam singapore kan dia uh nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa
so macam the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world lah instead of like the the uh afterlife
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those yang macam dia ada dua lah so macam dunya and deen
so like more macam be comfortable in your own skin
ya sure okay so kita tinggal like a few more minutes lah so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
okay so aku start first lah so regret aku is to be the beauty standard so macam dulu uh secondary one primary six semua kan aku macam very uh very insecure lah sebab macam
kita ada influence dengan K pop apa so macam kita nampak woo macam lawa seh and kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua I mean kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam uh we are not there lah so macam ya so like what I regret was like uh
like aku terlalu pentingkan like kecantikan dari luar instead of dari dalam ya
um then jap
like I think message something like to to remind you during your apa macam uh bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat lah I would say
um the priority will be uh ke uh work live and
I think pressure in terms of like macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam marriage lah so I think
I think the pressure will be more bila kawan-kawan kau dah start to slowly get married so macam you'll feel very pressured so um my message would be um
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause macam to to to learn to prioritise
do ask ask to do macam-macam
err finish my practicum yay um I think semalam
cause I macam like you know
true true then macam how to say ah
uh so macam
in a way macam same thing as um
uh so macam meet client then um got assessment then lepas itu
then macam apa itu my office is literally macam just beside the units where they live so macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven lah
ya lah okay lah existing cases tapi macam apa itu
because sekarang macam buat split teams kan then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each lah so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak
err like we face shortage of manpower lah macam cause um this the err
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs lah macam two services so dia kesian gila lah like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time bila phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
so uh so then macam then she also has to handle the clients kan the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she err she also has to attend to the matters there lah so macam double work
ah so she kesian ah
then baru sahaja recently another staff left ya cause
it's not pasal itu lah like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
but I don't know lah kalau macam
err yesterday I meet up with the um lah then dia tanya I like kalau do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added lah if I want to come to the company and work then macam I don't know what program lah ada satu program ini dia hey just started up their office is in simei which is like great lah macam very near my house
I realised my tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila ya
full time lah macam err how to say ah they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird lah macam I was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there lah the staff there there was like
then uh what macam um so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the uh my my um the staff there cakap uh the is the one you are interview lah
then macam like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor lah then then she on the first day I came in for my macam meet up session dengan dia and my reporting officer
sampai padahal they just want to get to know me better lah
so cute ah then she ask me lah macam like you can go this option this option then apa itu
um then she ask me if I want to continue working lah at the same place yang I buat internship itu then I macam err not sure lah like a bit too far lah but
I guess it makes sense lah for me to macam continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then macam in terms of macam you know blend in with the team gitu like they know it's going to work
I think internally adalah macam issue sikit lah cause dia dah macam cause ada change kan so macam the difference in mm apa power dynamics I guess much macam mm
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be macam less
err hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program kan so macam dia um just suppose head of the homes is actually macam a bit restricted lah
haiya he's like he's the one yang actually main person to do the homes and everything but because um the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then macam like dia dah lama dengan kita lah she already do this kind of this job so macam when she comes in and station kan the office gitu kan so err I think he feels a bit restricted lah
ya ya can tell sikit lah
macam I think dia macam like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then macam cause he got his own way of doing things then macam like he doesn't think that we should do this but err in a way
uh then macam like ya then macam at the end of the day macam like I dengar two things ah like I think dia pun macam segan and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I macam uh then macam at the end of the day dia cakap lah like I'm not trying to supervise you
but um this is how it's going to work lah this is how I we used to do it lah so macam I macam caught in tau
so like uh macam am I talking too much
ya macam like this client he came back from hospital then dia pakai taxi then he kept asking lah
lepas itu err I want to
err be refunded by for my cab then apa itu dia cakap
apa itu I put in a group chat lah where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
so then after I uh I got the message then the head of the homes came and then cakap lah like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I macam like what what is going on
ya and then macam like it felt weird like macam apa
like dia orang punya procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
ya so like macam I felt a bit err and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm macam
I guess macam dia orang treat me a bit like staff there lah which I understand ah macam like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think bila yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff lah macam they they allow me to do a lot of things
I I felt like macam still terikat lah like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things macam I tak check in sangat lah like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it lah but macam
uh macam as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so macam like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so macam in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client tidak ada
so macam two and a half months actually quite short lah
ada one satu grad dip then the other is I think um under grad but err it's her second practicum
uh so I think this company macam purposely they take up err
they tried to pick up macam grad dip yang pernah kerja
ya ya in the social service sector so that macam mm not train lah macam like you know uh
work etiquette ah work etiquette macam like organisation after awhile macam a lot of organization macam structured a certain way
and then macam there's like cause I know lah macam like there's policy there's guidelines macam there's to meet gitu so macam like I roughly know lah
ya so I kind of know lah punya mentality where they go they a bit
they are a bit macam
jaga muka jaga face sikit like macam they expect
I guess like macam when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast kan ya so macam some of them macam resistant some of them macam they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or macam the society or the community macam thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report lah to government or which is lah can trickle down to usually lah cause they always report to lah
so then anything raise up lah then blah blah blah nanti in the end turun to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so macam be miracle lah miracle workers then kita cakap dengan dia orang lah it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time dia orang pun tak nak someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
and then macam how to say
dia orang punya is a bit merepek lah at times I feel
cannot be that macam one case worker has to hold maybe around
err I think last time apa eh eighty cases
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer lah they wanted I think hundred I was like kalau hundred one case sahaja can be like besar gila because of their complications is are they
someone who is very minimal macam susah gila it's because like it comes and goes ah each person kadang-kadang this period they are okay some periods not and then also macam seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like macam chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause macam I think macam
how to say macam it ties into their
so dia teringat-ingat the families ah or what how is your relationship with their family lah that kind of thing
you ketawa
for like uh macam reporting period lah ya then macam
but I think macam they try to push lah macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work lah it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the lah because macam
it's try lah they try to lah maximum I think thirty to forty lah but then nowadays ah cases macam complicated you the person itself is not alone kan then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so macam orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah
and apa
I might lah I I will I will look through the simei one is a new program it it seems like macam um a a duplication of some of their services so macam like
I ask them ah what is it about this new program that you want to start uh new siting cause macam I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs lah
err I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred lah so then what's the macam main difference lah between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very um macam apa exploratory
oh no no there's no need to itu I have to I apply the usual route lah
macam I'm not in the headspace to cari kerja sekarang
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters ke tak next year is like I I feel macam
it's not that lah I macam don't know where to go yet I don't know if macam is the place for me to do masters like macam after one year one point five years of doing grad dip kan macam like
is it a good place to start like to study lah macam their profs are good and everything but macam ada I don't know lah what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work
uh I think I macam orang gatal sikit macam I cannot
think what about your current job yang yang part time how is it so far
so you have to be firm and you have to macam how to say
approachable macam like you don't be the too nice person is usually is all strict first
then afterwards macam like then they say you strict right then they respect then you come in and be nice
it's the little things lah you cannot macam force your way into it like macam like
whatever you say you keep to it then they will respect you even macam as young as two they will remember especially kids ah they will remember
alamak teruk lah ya
I don't know I I want to do it that time then I think I had to cancel my appointment cause siapa eh can't remember so I had it was a a clash then I tried to reschedule then after that circuit breaker then my mum pernah buat ya ya actually I want she okay sahaja
but I I tak
so I wanted to go again then I terlupa then a lot of things happen kan then ya you know orh this year is like a very um happening year for me
on monday tapi dekat mana
tempat itu jauh jauh seh for me
is it not the darah one right
ya my mum advised me to go for the darah one cause apa itu
ya so she asked me to go for the darah one she went for the darah one also actually
you my apa eh
I can't remember what my mum told me tapi dia cakap macam you can you kalau nak ikut sunnah itu you follow which day eh
no monday ke thursday tak ingat but definitely not friday ya
ah but she went for it but macam yang this one this lady dia buat itu the female one she she she lives in tampines ah then she she part time major
think ya ya buat dekat rumah dia
I tak ingat err
I book I book the itu then I
macam normal lah tak won't break your bank kind of situation lah
uh no my mum okay sahaja lepas bekam
at least you don't transcribe yourself I I was apa itu part of my assignment one of it is macam to do process recordings lah then I kena record myself with a conversation with a client
it was so cringey then I heard myself cause it's macam I pakai mask kan and then I have to macam analyse lah everything that I do with the client then I was like so uh I hate this I hate this like interview so long thirty plus
ya I know I think ya I think when I heard my uh voice macam like apa itu macam way lower then macam
uh macam
the normal normal high pitch I think I realised my voice is the lower register and then macam calm like more huh not calmer lah macam
then will be like kenapa hujan siapa nyanyi
mm no ah it just sounds normal to me ya I I don't know lah macam ada ya
I think I don't know lah macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
voice macam I think it's the um channel that they go into so macam when we hear our voices during our
apa itu using recording ke apa right ya it sounds weird net factor
can't imagine we apa itu sekarang what maybe they gonna do some space travel kan tak sampai ingat who is it ah the guy yang faizal tak suka itu no
okay okay can lah I don't mind cause technically macam it's either
macam no err no macam
parkway parade or like you know north east region gitu
actually macam ya in terms of connectivity macam cycling I think in the east is better
eh there is a dekat tampines there's a eco green park town
eh I is this the guy yang you were the one that ya the one that you macam not certain is it this one
ya lah it makes more sense lah habis itu ya
then sometime macam like kalau the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes macam
uh ada lah fiction you pernah dengar
outside you and the mother-in-law macam okay lah bermesra gitu but
I think macam like entah what would what would I know also
tak macam ada like female macam ada expectations on us like we should tak kisah lah kalau you kerja full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then macam like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
mm like macam apa itu
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja lah kasih duit
but nowadays is like susah lah nak
I know which is like macam a bit worrying lah macam I think I tengah fikir-fikir because macam
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause macam at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility kan but then also
like you shouldn't segan and not ask for help and then my mm then my parents dia orang tak nak macam they want to have their own lives lah they don't want to be like you know
it's like the only other options I can see is that I macam berhenti kerja sekejap lah jaga anak and then ya and then potentially you lose
uh apa itu credibility um relevancy to the the area that you are in then susah balik nak masuk kerja
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband ah and then macam a lot of people tell me lah macam oh what uh don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent macam like what is going on
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good lah kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop
ya so macam
technically kalau nak masuk playgroup lah it's a nice timing to masuk balik kerja and then
I don't know lah macam singapore punya culture not flexible yet
so macam
number one err it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very macam like uh abang why you asking for my name no ah upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in err
that's why lah but of course there's that connotation lah kan tapi it's not it's not really
so ah dia suka dia suka in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here abah was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got zina to sit right beside me
ah that one I didn't get to ask but that one is tak tak important lah ya
so the other ah important part was about his job experience lah so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain lah actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he apa the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and abah were very calm about it tak ada macam problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that eh
ah so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was ah number one ah apa there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then dia tinggal pasir ris
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale lah because they want to look for some a place near err istighfar
because dekat um the parents place pasir ris
this is this could have been boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik lah kan which is to
bilang kan that you want to um do this to both your parents and zina's parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that err the keys you know then what you have to actually this part abah was the one who ah already point out I just reiterated the point
nanti kan macam terdesak kan you have to like actually have to push for this ah then you are making it difficult for both sides
ah then he just he just nodded lah he he understood uh but I was still macam thinking eh do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here ah but I think it's in between lah it's in between that apologetic but also macam like okay
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel what begitu I say it's not about that lah it's about you informing do it properly
ah then I then I also talk to them lah like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan abah also want to hear what is his apa dia punya rancangan lah
um then it was very clear rancangan is that
the next year somewhere dalam march they intend to tunang dengan zina
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet abah probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement lah
the nikah would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least ada
ah then okay then at least say that gives proper time lah for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the abah was saying you know zina just got
err just finish studying jadi apa the plan in these two years for for her uh then this azram cakap oh ya uh this is to would be
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about macam like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me zina also needs to work to build up a
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why macam it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple tak payah tak ada complication
and I and I pun cakap dengan dia lah that
you nak kena
dia zina pun nak kena grow up
asing asing asing masing-masing kena grow up tersendiri
ah so you need give that time untuk you both nak kena grow up ah that's the thing budak itu diam jer so I tak puas hati because like you can just be numb about this whole thing lah that is a which is uh quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that abah is there something you want to uh anything you want to ask them uh I said ya so ah let me check in um so
so one thing that I brought out is you both nak kena
tersendiri grow
memang ah nak kena apa ada this uh
grow up right memang nak kena ada grow up tapi uh growing up needs to needs perlu berada dalam
ah context apa
maksud dia has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that uh growing up takes place both lah during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this ah so I made it very clear that don't just lip service dia perlu perbincangan further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate abah dengar ini tak mahu communicate communicate like tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa abah there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so um I think they got it lah so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
kau orang nak kena sit down nak kena plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say ah ya lah grow grow grow but you just gonna
tak work on it you just gonna macam letak kat tepi jer and just macam put it into the back of your mind tak nak macam
apa buat kerja develop this it's not gonna work
of course I'm not macam blind to this ah
because at the end itu mama dekat kitchen and mm mama malu malu lah apa lah nanti bila kita duduk makan baru mama duduk
dayah tak ada dayah said she doesn't want to be there also lah
I didn't say sembunyi-sembunyi lah I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
body gesture and how he interact with zina he is very firm he's just firm lah it's that not say very firm lah but it's firm macam whatever zina macam nak nak tanya ah ashraf right do you want water then he will just say
very macam he won't just he won't say oh it's okay zina he he won't
so I can see ah and the way he speaks also is macam very direct and very
ya so it's not macam so as as ambiguous as it was lah at least it's kind of macam very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to ah give zina time to work ah give zina time to develop
kita tak tanya pasal dia punya family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
changi business apa changi ah ya that one ya that one warehouse lah ya so
dia macam ya macam I I don't know that
so jadi macam
then abah abah is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that abah like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay abah is comfortable with him already
ah that's something that they will have to macam resolve lah how but at the very least they are giving zina time to grow
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been ah apa been attached to for the three months
ah it was okay normal not not that macam overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that ah the past uh he has yet to have the chance to go for jumaat players
ever since COVID like macam basically he's just trying to share lah like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like macam he just brought up we were talking about jumaat prayers and then we were sharing
ya tak payah macam pening-pening sangat
ah actually after that was a lot more interest lepas itu lagi interesting
was abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir ah ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah
ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik ah ah lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik
tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena kan then I said abah
abah nak kena tengok eh
hidayah okay you you got two different daughters abah cakap apa different both are daughter yes both are your daughters tapi there are two different girls two different daughters
zina is on the receiving end she is zina sudah memang nak menerima
apa berkahwin hidayah I don't think she is there yet dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu
then zina pun add in ah ya but she says she wants to get married ya memang dia nak tapi is she proactive looking no what she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors uh
then uh then I said so abah you need to understand yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan
so abah kena recognize that and dayah is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say abah macam habis kita then I say okay yes I know I I faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana now bila habis sampai bila abah kata
then abah let me give you some advice
if you nak di to even
abah err mama bila nak
calonkan or menunjukkan calon
biar quality
biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada quality dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik of course sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam give up dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah just throw jer ya then mama say tapi the one yang dekat australia itu abah mama tahu tak he is just a taxi driver then dayah will think macam macam bingit lah
because he actually err apa he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to sewakan rumah ini so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
itu lah yang aku cakap
that's why I say cari orang berkualiti berkualiti is not just about
ya so anyway jadi macam
abah understood that lah I said abah tak boleh control apa dayah nak ini
abah boleh control kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh control itu itu yang abah boleh control
so I said right now it seem that dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan fine tapi cari berkualiti this if people are not are ada quality and I said pada abah it's not about social status it's not about macam kaya tak kaya ya it's about the dia nak kena match ah
jadi budak ini dengan dayah are two different people so cannot
then membina diri sendiri eh macam mana
ah lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina
tak boleh zina cakap ah ya ya okay I will look at it lah abang ya
dia cakap abang lah okay
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said oh I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know uh semalam that err you you are ashraf then I was thinking okay how is it macam mana dia akan menerima ini ah cara eh
zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku like
nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama I don't know lah but then lepas itu dia tanya err abang your name is salim is it ah yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me abang ah like if macam dia satay ada banyak ya then abang also can bring back the
so I thought err ya that's why it was easy lah macam abang pun cakap and because like I said
I told ashraf that I'm appreciative yang dia terus terang dia
ada apa ada wawasan lah ah
lepas itu abang pun cakap ah yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak clear ah habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini
encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini ah
okay lah I thought macam the
macam mana it went through was good lah ya
ah azlina azlina need to macam grow up lah on this
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're macam like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has lah correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what ashraf has did did you see or not how ashraf did it
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi
kan daddy cerita senang then I say isn't it simple so that macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru
ah you just have to be upfront jer kan senang and ya lah ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
aku cakap dengan dia yang easy-going dengan being firm
during the discussion dengan ashraf I was saying zina
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study mm ah ashraf dengar jer lah what he want to say he just mm mm
mm but whatever it is he is already macam he never macam like show the reaction of macam you know or he didn't show it lah of being tak nak tak nak apa oh like shock or what I think he knows ah what he's getting into with zina
ya lah I agree of course that's why I said they both tersendiri nak kena grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed tersendiri
if if kalau izat buat gitu then I will tell him off lah eh kau kenal dia ke tak kan kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa so we have to be we have to take this step kita kena uh apa kita mesti
ambil uh
kegiatan begini ah tak boleh macam ah
tak boleh macam apa ambil scenario jer
I faham
no lah dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan no
I was two zero abah open this topic about dayah then I was asking zina zina what have you been talking to dayah lah about dayah's like err relationship or a'ah zina cakap no we don't talk each other huh
sekarang dua-dua sudah try kan
dua-dua sudah try
tak boleh kan so you tell me apa nak kena buat sekarang
nak buat apa sekarang then dia sudah ah ya try again lah try no
sudah try sudah sekarang kan tak boleh kan so nak kena buat apa
do what you want me to tell you the answer takkan lah I have to give you the answer
why you must have the jawapan for me
I want to hear from your own mulut
and then dia cakap ya then kita nak kena ask someone to help ah then siapa this someone to help
kenapa it has to be me to ask you to
you know abang salim kita ada problem
okay just kind of macam jumpa
see things eye to eye tak boleh macam bersefahaman
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why zina kalau if this were the reverse that let's say you and zina you and dayah
macam mana pun that has happen ah izat would still come and apologize to me
then you did zina was saying macam like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to izat
macam like life lah about children about
apa marriage like that that
lah macam ya lah macam like how how he uh apa decided to get married with with salimah then ya we have ya before even during during apa
during ah our apa being after being married also we still talk about macam certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not macam pen pals is not like macam like the way I would talk to faris for example but
macam at least macam things things about personal things I still can talk to him macam I can easily talk to him macam eh izat kau tengok macam ah macam dayah is like I I can have the conversation with izat you know ya I can but macam
dayah and zina will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that macam
no lah not really enstranged like even after this one I I have macam move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise dulu lagi tak boleh apologise pun dia punya ego is so big
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to macam make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms hidayah and zina is different they are just happy with being ignored
dayah zina sudah give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring hidiyah
that's how bad it is ah so at least me and izat kalau kita disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like izat macam has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that macam he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not macam um tak nak berbual dengan si salim no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he macam best character he needs to learn to work it out
kita semua memang have your own areas of growth but
dayah and zina is like they just ignore the problem then I say zina especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi kan lagi kau orang lagi will be more separated
you and dayah ready have a problem bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi what do you think
this passive aggressiveness tak boleh tak boleh ah
and not just macam like ah tak apa no it's not tak apa
ya I I did I did macam tell her lah that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that uh
you nak kena
fikir how
this is important this memang mustahak
you cannot just macam biarkan that this issue err to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
ah first you have to you setuju if you setuju
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak then
jadi it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem masalah yang dia ada ini is trust issues hidayah doesn't trust her because hidayah feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what zina has trust issues because things dayah is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you ah so that's why lah trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts ah so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
tak boleh ah it's just not healthy and you cannot just
biarkan macam gitu jer
mama abah just listen so good thing was
mama abah willing to hear
mm kenapa
zina was uh no I uh zina was saying that she was um the reason why apa she went on to telling izat first because she felt more comfortable talking to izat
then she she sudah bingit lah bila kena rubbish then she walk off
she she kena already lah then she walk off
then say ya of recent years it has been the case ah that's that's the part I said ah rubbish then stop it since when then she already sudah kena then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it lah macam like eh mana wah you are the
so going back to yang tadi kan we were talking about zina and dayah and I was asking zina who do you think you
jadi sebab dia kena tengok and understand that this is the situation
and zina sit down together then they can iron this out lah macam
they just don't see the point in macam making sure that they are
true lah dia tak boleh macam just simply you know say that oh this is a one time deal mesti lah dia ingat
ya so obviously it takes steps lah it's not macam I one time can boleh boleh
akak kakak last kerja kat mana
okay kak okay kalau kalau kerja kat situ kan apa yang akak pelajari
jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar lah daripada incident tu
okay kakak sekarang mempunyai um experience experience di dalam bahagian industri baking um kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba industry yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba
apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar uh kanak-kanak yang kecil
kira kakak tahu kan yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak have the skills untuk cope with this problem
dengan adanya technologies sebagai telefon bimbit dan tablet adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda
kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita around ten years old ke eight years old gitu bila tak ada komputer semua or bila takde handphone kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita time kecil
kakak ingat tak dulu beza eh sebab dulu kita takde netflix takde youtube kita cuma tengok live and live kadang-kadang if you want to go to the toilet nak kena tunggu advertisement
then remember last time you have to apa nak kena rush the toilet kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat
sekarang senang jer now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it kan like how did we survive last time like kalau you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit susah tapi like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
like there's only one computer in the house then kalau if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so kakak remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way macam
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at rumah lama that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
orang kaya kan bagus nak jadi nak jadi kaya-raya
boleh tolong mak bapa sekarang kan pembelanjaan kan banyak that's why I need a lot of money lah and
furthermore now my age is already dah tiga puluh lebih tahun
so I will need the income the additional money to support my mum lah and my dad ni semua
oh ya lagi dua wish okay lagi dua wish is mula-mula nak jadi orang kaya selepas tu nak jadi orang yang kurus
cause I am right now I'm my weight is about one one two so I'm quite fat lah and dulu-dulu kan I was actually um eighty kilo only I was quite fit lah go to gym one week four times
per day I mean four times a week I do all kinds of exercise even at one point in time I even had a abs lah kirakan dua pack ke
empat pack punya abs lah kirakan dah tu I also last time belajar karate judo belajar mixed martial arts semua
cuma sekarang jer lah dah apa tu dah kerja kan jadi pun dah malas
um lepas kaya sihat okay err since my age now is tiga puluh dua tahun I'm just waiting for three more years lah then I wish that I can buy my own I don't want to buy private cause the maintenance tinggi sangat
so I just want to buy itu pun kalau boleh empat bilik lima bilik ataupun masionette lah mana yang I mampu why
cause kalau beli rumah besar sikit boleh rental income so I can meet one of the agent yang I kenal which is my friend lah
ask them for advice so they can help me lah um tolong cari kalau boleh pun nak nak beli rumah dekat-dekat dengan hospital ataupun dekat-dekat dengan any healthcare punya tempat macam polyclinic or what why
cause kalau kita pindah dekat situ I mean kalau kita ada rumah kat situ
kita boleh rental kan rumah dengan nurse nurse lah lagipun nurse gaji kan okay boleh tahan so kirakan kita boleh earn quite a lot from that rental income ah kirakan ah itu saja lah yang my three wishes lah very realistic punya wish ah cause kalau kita wish merepek pun I mean uh bukannya boleh mencapai kan so I will always wish on things that I can achieve I can confirm I can achieve
okay lah kalau if I have any superpowers out of the three right
hmm superpowers eh err superpowers what are the three eh apa best eh mm
tengok gambar avengers
superpowers ah jadi thor ah
thor best ah thor thor is the god of thunder dia boleh pergi to a different realm boleh pergi space boleh pergi sana sini
thor pun kuat kan dia punya ada hammer dia lah hammer ada dua macam macam hammer lah
abeh lepas tu dia boleh pergi mana dia nak pergi he's the strongest ah actually but then there's also another one strongest which is also my choice is a
captain marvel I know that captain marvel is a lady lah but uh actually kalau you can make it into a man punya character pun bagus juga
so it's basically the strongest avengers in all the avengers even thanos pun kalah okay there's one more is I like to be the witch ah a witch
from also from avengers kenapa
cause yang time kita tengok end games tu actually kalau
thanos dia tak panggil ah apa tu dengan dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia who make it link it's actually witch tu witch tu yang akan kalahkan dia lah cause he's already
on the verge of losing bila bila kalah rabak ah but then cause he asked the dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia untuk bring down the ring
so all the yang spaceship besar punya cannon tu kena tembak jer rabak ah kena that's the three superhero that I want
hulk no cause hulk dia besar sangat actually kalau tinggal dekat singapore nak jadi hulk aduh
sebab tu kat singapore kalau nak beli kereta pun jangan beli kereta besar beli kereta kecil sudah kalau beli kereta besar kereta punya parking pun bukannya besar-besar pun
yang parking lama lagi halus-halus jer nak pergi sana sini aduh nak belok jer nak u-turn jer leceh
kita punya roads actually very very small so it's the best kalau
even your body jangan lah jadi macam bodybuilder have a small physique lah kirakan angan badan besar-besar sangat
meal tu apa makan apa-apa ah
ah until now I pernah makan
itu that is very memorable apasal
itu whale meat yang paling mahal sekali
actually dia punya whale meat dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis jer dia potong
lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan ramen ramen
dia punya japanese version punya ramen lah then kita makan
selepas tu first I thought macam dia punya dia punya portion dia is quite big tau besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih too little
oh it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause uh it's not sashimi usually orang jepun kalau kasih sashimi dia akan letak dekat a different plate
but this one is cooked uh but not like deep fry punya cook lah macam I think steam or what lah cause
dia letak on top of the ramen itself so we must eat along on the ramen dengan dia punya
condiments ah basically dengan dia punya seaweed semua lah
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually um the most unique lah paling unique sekali and dia punya
restaurant is actually located outside meiji shrine ah yang pasal halal
tak halal tu actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese punya
restaurant kan once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else macam
babi or any uh meat stuff lah even ayam ke daging ke apa so once they sell barang
seafood is purely hundred percent just barang seafood jer
okay okay yang itu paling best okay yang dia punya whale bila makan it's eh dia punya potong slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
lah put inside my mouth it just melts dia kira macam makan butter gitu cuma rasa dia is bukan butter rasa dia is lemak tapi bukan lemak macam
kambing ke lemak ah no tau it's just lemak
but you just taste the sea water so kirakan
lemak ikan and whale punya lemak is really one of a kind ah it's really wah if
kalau awak pernah makan macam sea urchin ke apa ah macam gitu I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat itu itu yang very very very unique
ah tak pasti isi or fats
but uh mostly it's I think fats ah cause kalau isi whale kan is a tough kan
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut even fats kambing
ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti melts in the mouth
ah so that is the thing and lagipun dia punya I think dia potong tipis-tipis lah so I can't really
actually takde yang okay compare japan korea lah kita jangan cakap pasal thailand
thailand is dia punya makan just semuanya pedas-pedas jer
uh japan boleh tahan uh but japan punya makan is betul-betul
yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu is you know what um makanan korea
cause makanan korea even dia punya mee hitam tu yang
orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa exactly the same as kita punya mee rebus
yes jajangmyeon cause kita punya mee rebus semua the difference is jajangmyeon is macam dia macam basah-basah
dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa exactly the same macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah and of course kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap cause why kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi
and ada telur ada apa so dia orang punya is a mixture of japanese
punya taste bud dengan mix with into mee rebus punya rasa that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique lah quite unique tapi yang I really like about korea is dia punya daging bulgogi
itu I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner dia punya daging bulgogi dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas enough ialah cukup
cause pasal pasal daging bulgogi dia is macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu bulgogi tu you imagine macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate fuh lepas tu makan dengan nasi
nasi biasa nasi panas-panas eh steam rice ke apa
sedap you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you takkan rasa jelak I mean according to my taste lah cause I really like the daging bulgogi
yes I've tried wagyu beef yang halal punya actually we have
until apa tu um A three ke A two usually halal punya wagyu beef there's no A five yang tak halal punya iya yang A five cause um
yang halal punya is actually err it's only made in australia
yang the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself lah yang halal punya is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five punya punya apa tu punya punya grading
the the wagyu beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan yang yang ah
the essence of wagyu beef ah yang banyak marbling it's also I heard there's also a
for the wagyu beef punya itu ah market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya the rest of it is a usually um
tak uh no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia punya is uh dia punya grade not that high lah but dia punya rasa okay lah actually okay lah the thing about
uh wagyu beef is just that dia punya lemak jer
yang if you if you really notice kan dia punya yang urat-urat tu is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the lemak fats is the same
what makes it different is that orang jepun ni dia punya wagyu beef dia suka potong raw
makan macam apa tu the sashimi eh then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that umami effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
ada itu umami punya effect umami effect is exactly like how you
eat macam uh apa tu
ajinomoto dia that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the wagyu beef
uh dia punya lemak-lemak dia
oh like I say just now lah I only eat bulgogi cause that's to me is the best of the best paling sedap
the bulgogi is really my got to lah I've eaten orang makan thailand makan indonesia melayu semua I just like bulgogi cause bulgogi pun kira macam-macam tau a different part of korea yang halal punya they make different type of bulgogi the one that I really like is the budak-budak yang bikin kat
that hill daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua
makanan halal from singapore from malaysia
turkey negeri arab semua ada so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque nama dia
oh tak apa-apa nama dia is is not it's a adalah I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
okay cause dia pun macam road kan so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small macam
err macam mana eh you know like those kind of arab street punya shophouses you go ah
macam gitu you go then adalah dekat situ ah actually yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu
a lot of them and also there are other specialty kan it's actually ayam rebus and dia punya ayam it's actually they take the whole
macam spring chicken dia kasih steam itu benda
and dia rebus kat dalam the chicken soup the chicken broth wah then they they just ah basically
dia tak potong tak apa the steamed chicken tu they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
ah apa tu one bowl of rice
fuh makan sedap ah actually during winter makan tu is the best ah
not really winter lah it's quite cold but not really winter yang I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
dalam minus
twelve ah minus twelve yang paling sejuk ah lepas tu yang paling best kan kat japan on the new year's day new year's day pagi-pagi bangun
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean dia punya snow dia punya snow is tak banyak must wait for the night time then we go to the
ah kalau you go cause tokyo kan is bandar kan so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields dekat yang pokok-pokok ah then you can take the snow from there
err truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore punya weather cause singapore punya weather you can only expect two
punya weather lah like uh autumn
uh apa tu spring lah winter
livelihood lah I mean tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah berapa besar lah rumah kita then lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk weather singapore sendiri dah
dah banyak apa lagi kalau imagine kita kena simpan for
winter clothings lain
autumn clothings lain
spring clothings lain summer clothings lain so we will ah take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal lah that is for me lah but unless it's ah you are
talking about we are living in japan negeri dia besar even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there dia punya rumah sana
murah-murah and actually it's freehold tau it's not macam kita lease
ninety nine years is freehold rumah dia is actually very affordable
kita punya rumah three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized punya rumah in japan freehold
punya scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area macam kita punya
tempat lah hougang ang mo kio
kita punya you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right kalau dekat jepun you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban ah it's macam dia punya heartland ah kira
is all rumah dia is all uh rumah bungalow bungalow bungalow
lepas tu yang ada tempat ada gate yang ada tempat tak ada gate but mostly tempat dia orang is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
dia punya village dia is actually a farm
dia akan farm is actually itu farm dia uh jepun punya beras kan lain kan so basically all the villagers dia akan um
apa tu have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right ah until modernization come lah but that farm itself right untuk kalau
nasi basic punya nasi is actually more than enough to feed the whole
so even until now also there are still people but not young people lah the old people ah dia orang tua-tua yang ah mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right um yang paling best kita orang tourist they let they let us enter
cause dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun
dia orang will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english yang
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english pun is actually
broken english it's not really full uh punya english the language that we learn um from our
oh budak-budak singapore kita punya english is one of the highest grade lah kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa english in all of asian punya country even if you go to like
russia even china you know apatah lagi malaysia indonesia ni semua their english level dengan budak singapore punya level
is really macam langit dengan bumi lain
oh tak for japan tak uh it depends on where you go kalau itu tempat is betul-betul hundred percent muslims okay usually macam gini even if you go
to any other country macam thailand even bali or what kan kalau if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a dua dapur
one dapur is for the halal the other dapur is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they ada dua dapur for those pure
muslims usually yang macam if you go japan is those
orang kita cakap mualaf ah orang jepun mualaf ke apa ah they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the dia punya sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually kalau macam kita punya singapore ada MUIS
ah so they also have their own punya MUIS lah dekat in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those uh restaurants yang mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think dia punya rental dia punya duit
sewa dia every month is very expensive so they need to cover lah they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive mm korea jepun all the same even bali even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop dia punya area
that's how they live their life I mean untuk kita kalau macam extra was-was kita jangan makan but you must we must know that there is actually two dapur
it's not one dapur they make they mix everything together no no no two different dapur
actually they yang the alcohol pun it's not really dapur lah it's just macam a bar just a bar place
err cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty ah but since kita pun dah ada banyak options sekarang so mm
uh what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much lah kalau macam dia cakap buah avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday nanti you get other complications when you get when you eat benda yang is too good everyday is no good if you search
there's this guru from india he say garlic is the best uh medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
uh have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic punya uh cara perubatan really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic punya treatment they all use garlic
itu aje the most the most healthiest yang I eat
apa-apa skills lah is it the the the
hardware dengan software punya skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether nak jadi apa I say I nak jadi kaya kan so
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine ah you dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja eight to five
or kerja shift or whatever
untuk cari nafkah you straightaway have an app
cause sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua they
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in negeri macam kita ni singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause kita punya negeri ah is the hub for education so if we have the right skills kita boleh bikin product from that skill
I suka makan so I kalau boleh skill untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak um but one thing eh kalau I suka masak I don't like to
masak a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before dia punya barang mahal-mahal portion besar yes dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam very posh
tetapi their fusion food macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu even dengan tekak orang putih they don't like cause um when you
fusion western dengan asian punya makanan
uh I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants yang ada makanan fusion yang betul-betul
err how to say ada dia punya rasa dia is you can actually you can want to go there again lah
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event macam birthday ke kawan-kawan nak celebrate birthday promotions ke ah probably
sekali-sekala macam gitu dah but for
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money untuk apa kan
oh ya uh the last skill eh I have eh okay basically for me eh I daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah start belajar karate lah
uh I really want to have that kind of skill untuk
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it macam example karate
ah judo ataupun mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
karate under okinawan punya style
and okinawan punya style is actually the original punya karate lah which is actually
in fact yang karate yang
orang jepun practice is actually fake
cause orang jepun punya karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about orang jepun it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese punya karate
it's called nama dia bukan karate nama dia karate-do
do dalam bahasa jepun is a way of life even judo
all the do yang kat belakang semua is actually maksud orang jepun
is a way of life so orang jepun is more on to the perfectionism
tapi if you really learn the original okinawan punya style it's more of the
the relax orang okinawa actually belajar karate like even
kalau awak awak belajar okinawa punya karate kan
even if you come late the the orang the instructor tu can actually still accept you but for orang jepun punya karate
so untuk orang okinawa punya karate is actually untuk orang malas-malas err like myself
actually orang okay the main difference between okinawa punya karate dengan japanese punya karate is this orang jepun punya karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to oo oo dia kira itu dia punya how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by uh contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think ah orang jepun punya karate is by contracting their body
untuk kasih badan dia tense
uh cause untuk dia orang what they learn from
aikido judo ni semua if you
um you can practise the real okinawan punya punya martial arts ah punya ni karate cause even
dia they call this macam kita ah nama dia bunga-bunga lah kita punya silat bunga-bunga
err orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun
punya is a
nama dia kata kata
so kirakan okinawan punya kata is actually more
practical tapi orang jepun punya kata is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't uh focus about dia punya feel
actually ini karate ni semua eh it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a budak yang belajar okinawan karate dengan japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm budak okinawa they will win cause orang jepun they also learn kata but dia punya kata and karate dia they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause untuk orang
korea punya
orang korea punya the way they fight bila when they practise
but orang jepun dia punya kata
the stands dia punya kuda-kuda dia is
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original punya martial arts fight is for
you ask them to fight each other yang long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan punya orang
come close to japanese punya
karate punya budak
dia akan blur dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin
okinawan punya karate will always win japanese punya karate
but the big but eh orang okinawa even though they are more relax dia punya gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
okinawa punya karate kan every class only maximum ten to fifteen people yang belajar
ah dia punya guru dia they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan punya karate lama-lama is dying out
but japanese punya karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class ada dalam hundred people
two hundred people tiga ratus orang belajar in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese punya karate-do
ah and also in ah in japan punya karate-do
but by right the original karate yang from okinawan one
that is the true essence of okinawan punya karate
ah tu
bezanya it's actually there's a lot of difference ah you can talk
three days three nights eh tiga hari tiga malam boleh
berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis cause it's actually the punya cerita is very interesting
apa eh
okay for singapore context eh aku nak percuma senang jer
cause healthcare dekat singapore yang paling mahal lepas tu
yang lain benda percuma is of course kereta dengan rumah lah rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal
orang budak-budak singapore ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah
yang dia orang boleh mampu uh mostly is that's the case lah lepas tu yang pasal
kereta of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
yang kau dah kasih orang lease for ten years engkau charge orang tu sampai hundred over thousand for a a normal car
carparks yang kita ada is tak cukup
apa barang free nak of course lah nak rumah kereta dengan healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare dah ada pernah personal experience ah kalau dekat singapore you do not have any insurance apa-apa jadi dengan you ah
bayar lah sendiri sampai pokai
kalau ada insurance boleh cover sikit at least duit tu boleh cari juga lah
boleh apa orang cakap ah termampu
kalau no insurance at all ah kena bayar pokai-pokai ah pandai-pandai lah hidup nak
what we do okay kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu
then zaman kegemilangan islam
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the khalifah punya empire
ada dibiayai lah oleh
so apa dia orang bikin
dia belajar um err
zaman-zaman rome punya punya buku-buku
they translate daripada latin pergi arab
in fact ah even the egyptian punya historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why kita banyak actually a lot of our
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually ah push ah macam all the
so kalau untuk zaman sekarang if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing lah we will explore untuk sekarang lagi kita ada we are very modernize
kita akan explore the space ah
ah just ah apa tu
kita manusia ni we we love to explore
we automatically learn a lot of new things lah macam gitu lah
ah repeat repeat soalan
work bukan activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity kalau activity
okay activity yang paling boring kan eh
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight tak boleh cause uh you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
mm kalau okay lah
cause why I every time I hungry kalau rumah tak ada makan I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
kira kan I don't do a lot of stuff
dekat luar I'm always at home so kalau
say about macam bad stuff no lah not really lah
kalau ada bad stuff mesti hidup pun I can't sleep at night also lah
kalau not really lah
I yang pasal ni I can't really say much lah ah ya
dia punya abs tu eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
dia jadi achilles achilles itu punya movie okay I like two movies ah in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is ah ni lah troy so that the difference
is actually pasal orang paling kuat achilles
mm in the end he died he have a choice actually kalau dia if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong lah
had eternal glory macam orang ingat dia
any normal egoistic man he actually uh it shows kita manusia especially man ah uh all
about this movie right about three hundred and ni ah troy is all the quotes that they used
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity itu word eh macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena
so it's it's about the same thing and also dalam
ah gambar-gambar macam achilles ni semua troy ni semua it's all the same thing it's their quotes eh you can actually bring it to real life and ikut lah so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out one lah
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is uh macam
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy yang
texts yang panjang-panjang semua
prefer texts yang macam
yang pendek-pendek short and sweet kirakan macam gitu yes summary and also mostly
thirty two tiga puluh dua tahun
tengah buat apa is it the O levels
apa eh actually seventeen
apa eh actually nak cakap err
actually kalau if I look back in my life right
kalau whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever lah I've been through um but kalau betul-betul nak advice of course lah um
cause at that time also kalau misal kata nak cakap oh you learn coding you learn all these app making right
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn sekolah poly that I learn is actually that was the
err orang yang ajar tu pun the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that err they are not that brilliant also
so if you ask me to macam you know to start a something new I don't think uh there will be good advice cause
microsoft mark zuckerberg ni semua eh the way they start kan is a really is all a downhill task lah
ah so cause also apa-apapun nak kena see
tujuh belas tahun really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned wah betul-betul uh benda baru
wah ni banyak boss semua cakap gini
you just be normal stuff ah five years' time eh okay kalau cakap pasal goals eh um
I don't have the urge to buy a car cause I use to own a car and I know how expensive to own a car in singapore and really I I don't see myself like macam ada have that kind of materialistic punya goals
terus jadi billionaire
I would want to go to that path instead of any of the materialistic thing macam nak beli rumah besar
beli kereta besar all these I don't want cause benda-benda gini semua kita hidup dekat singapore we know that it won't last for cars
alright boleh
boleh eh okay so basically aku tanya uh whoever living at my place first to do this lah cause I thought need to do at my house
then I aku call siapa ham boy dengan uh I they technically live near my place what so easier so I call them dua dua tak nak buat
I actually oh my god I forgot to tell ham he told me uh dia nak fikir dulu
ah nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
no is based on macam first come first basis
okay basically err my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
sekali suddenly she just sent me this lah so I actually thought this was a debate
ah so aku so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I ah call you lah uh I was looking for people ah macam ham boy
actually one of my friend who stay kat
ah very near right tapi dia tak nak
like I don't I don't get some people punya mindset macam
tak kan satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
oh my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
ah actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want ah ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
ah always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
kita tukar question jer ah
tukar question
let me guess kau kene kerja for
settle down relax there K dah settled
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
ah but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita lah
six fifty nine I aku dah kat rumah
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
so they talk about the dulu orang Turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
uh rumah tangga
uh musuh
cucuk belakang and all ah oh my god I tell you
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class ah
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek kan two years in a row ah don't need study ah lepak ah
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class eh kita focus jer how to be best in the cohort
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
lepak kat luar lah ah tak belajar after oral
aku main catching
ah prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
past tak terjadi
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
yeah oh my god dorang punya cara berbual
some um country ah they you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
like dulu punya time ah
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
dia punya masalah yang betul kan is actually apa tau
life hidup
macam life is so simple
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
everyday activity lah bukan kerja ke apa macam K for me
nanti muak pe
and what jelak sama jer lah
eh kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi tau pasal sekolah
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
intuition that I can read people face so like I know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
like oh muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini oh macam gini ah orang dia
so tak ah so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
I expected you to be a super mat rep
err perang perang kan
so actually alamak confirm mat rep eh fikir dia siapa sia
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the apa the headmaster apa
course head eh apa
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa hamizan tak ingat
what skill eh apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
I mean I heard of it before tapi macam
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu kan cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
then you know his uh dia punya cara marah macam mana kan see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
takde lah
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops lah ni lah tu lah ni lah tu lah
ah definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so I can them like bombard them
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
so aku macam oh my god
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa lah hidup macam ni
it's for me is merepek ah like I I can't believe ah macam
K ah kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly kan what what's the point
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit jer
abeh kalau kat rumah I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
precisely I aku it is
I find it super merepek
so it it made me like oh you know what ah so tiring ah malas ah
ah tak leh ah tak leh ah
abeh come by my house lah one once in a while
eh kim cam
pergi pe ons see you in five minutes five minutes eh toa payoh to woodlands
why your apa engine so loud
yeah I never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit jer singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa ah
kalau kau tanya aku eh mm
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
if they give us like pre before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
like I pay for competition semua
izzul kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot eh sorry sorry sorry
no no no K basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
so my game and dorang punya game tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
tak kira apa-apa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in Singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
correct so parents aku suka apa tau they like err
air bahasa melayu apa ah
angin tu wind
oksigen ah ni dalam melayu properly ah eh
oksigen ah the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
G E N oksigen
kau punya okay ah let me see eh
then tak tahu dapat dorang punya salary ke tak
dorang punya families kat overseas macam mana
book reservation punya
kalau dorang buat ni eh kalau dorang buat ni kan
dorang punya tracking system pun senang tau actually you know what implement to all shops
dorang buat gini senang nak track orang
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai right
tapi satu masalah will be apa tau
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play takraw kat serangoon sana
because kalau if kalau kita lepak kat luar
ah kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa like we just do our own things
Italy they have a very big hit all this macam tourist attraction punya tempat eh very big hit
so kau masih kerja
eh tu nenek aku
I mean technically it's my sleeping time ah aku switch aku punya body clock
after asar to subuh
now is subuh to after isyak
okay apa ni kau punya time tinggal berapa
sixty mine is only fifty nine fifty seven okay lah I guess kita end the conversation now lah eh
so macam very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
if aku ada pagi punya kelas then she have petang punya kelas then if have if I have petang punya kelas then she have pagi punya kelas then it's like you really boring
lepas tu it's like how to say
it's very dry cause sekarang tak ada hands on cause of the COVID so kita tak ada jadi hands on activity
then I'm like central ada macam
uh childcare kat dalam kan tapi kita tak dapat pergi and we suppose to pergi so now it's like really dry and like err boring and all we do is like datang school lah habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
but then at the same time macam best sebab
dapat jumpa kawan pe
dapat jumpa kawan habis like
we go eat together sometimes tapi macam sometimes cause semua tinggal jauh-jauh so we cannot
do anymore but then college central still do but now because ah recently ada like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless macam is online class tu pun online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
habis lepas tu kita buat powerpoint slides about the muscles all lah
but ah then actually tak do like any like that is kalau kita buat macam project ni kan
it is counted as kita punya participation mark
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot lah from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now kita tak boleh buat so we don't do anymore then we have like
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then macam quite senang lah cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you oh your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing kan pasal
each of the people can there's like uh over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final nanti kau your
kau dapat when nanti kau dapat tahu ah kau do like well ke tak then after that for my class like kan you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good kan you have the opportunity to retake your punya like test lah but then my class tak ada orang retake cikgu cakap like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module tu macam cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say macam
uh in macam experience through experience cause we do a lot buat macam relationship management lepas tu kita buat the time kita buat like kita punya individual presentation kan it just
we in right this is the frustrating thing ah cikgu just go just go through
cikgu just go through mana part yang kita nak ada buat assignment one dia orang tak ajar like throughout macam in secondary school they ajar everything what even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and dia orang bagi pun
uh is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like kenapa budak ini nangis then kenapa ah dia tak eh separate dengan parents jer then uh what kind of symptoms
so macam a bit dry it's very dry
business writing is more to macam you write emails letters
then is easier in a way because ada multiple choice
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then yang section yang lain cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
we are like like you said lah this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april oh we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like macam how to say
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab COVID
tak yang mana eh tak boleh keluar sedih and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
tak boleh keluar cause mana-mana pergi tak ada duit
so mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit kan
and then like ni then can think about like other stuff
but they want to tanya you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
do like I I I just like to get it over with macam
senang kan kalau kau
aku like I can do bila-bila aku nak I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
macam I'm a I'm a bad person lah I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like banyak gila is the amount of like group projects right is banyak is like until like every week you tukar group you've just tukar tukar tukar constantly you tukar cause cikgu first of all like
the reason they give is because sebab apa cikgu nak kita meet
work with people they want dia orang nak tengok how
speak english or like other ada apa language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
macam mana kau boleh cope dengan working with other people
kalau aku group yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat frustrated tau
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy aku macam noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done macam complete ah cepat habis cepat kau pergi relax cepat kau pergi like
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like semua my project kan is die like hujung hujung last minute submit like eh but eh is good work lah we are able to provide good work but it's still
depends banyak dengan who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together ada like yang they are mm
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name ima cause he just talk malay cause he macam he's really a perfect
honestly banyak orang cakap is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
banyak yang senang like
senang for you to masuk senang for you to complete senang for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate macam kau yang classmate bo chup like serious like
tak buat kerja kan I mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat A even though gonna work is like so bad
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar math kau ajar one two three four five under ten pun sudah okay dah you are set for life in that career in that sense lah
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so macam
but then macam what they never think is that
really competitive you know like the other type that macam every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada like macam oh
they like the macam
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam I know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking lah but she's clever but rela also clever but she also don't think about ranking macam kita
sorry to say but melayu more relax lah
kita macam more like okay tak apa kalau pass pass kalau fail fail gitu tapi we try hard
tapi macam there are a lot more other races macam they are very keen on
macam competing macam hardcore gila ni semua kan so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning ah but we are learning it break we break up
more slower in a sense kita boleh more slow but
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school macam aku dah fail fail fail fail fail lepas tu bila kat the end aku macam okay pass macam I made it jelita bah cause I I do set expectation that are high
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up macam
I aku rasa macam very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
senang jer macam gitu then I'm just like oh my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
aku go into thinking that macam
senang like ni like it will be nak very easy
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid takkan tell me budak tapi tak nak observe budak tu lepas tu I nak tanya write report pasal budak tu then I'm just like oh my god I cannot do this
but dia orang ingat like macam ni senang cause kau jaga budak jer pe kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga but actually
we watch how the budak grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes cikgu yang responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then kita okay just besar macam okay lah by this age dah cakap actually there's a
oh I look back my slides right I'm learning ah I'm like tengah revise jer aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak and we revise okay that's actually link kita belajar pasal brain then kita faham okay which budak pakai which part of the brain when they are doing this budak pakai then we are just like oh my god we are just learning like
seniors mereka cakap from the first year
kau boleh tahu how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously kau dah tahu like you are like
macam it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly eh tak tahu apa-apa they don't know anything about budak-budak you don't know anything like
some people even like masuk early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how macam early childhood has
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
for the next few years kau ada job untuk dapatkan they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay aku nak pergi uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
I want to I don't know initially memang aku nak baca psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide macam belum decide kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam I'll pass macam how to say ah
poly obviously I aku tak nak just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
my friend said that in every like I was macam very when dapat pergi kan you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that apa tu once in your lifetime you must experience life
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but sekarang COVID so kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she bawa nintendo switch jer pergi class ah semua orang main just dance is like that kind of thing
all of us want to go poly semua nak pergi poly kita punya ultimate goal is poly
macam bila kau kat first day
dia orang tanya kau like um
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay ngee ann temasek ngee ann temasek that kind of stuff bah banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
macam susah tapi that
bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap okay memangnya it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
that's obviously true lah then macam very susah then I see you learn by laju so aku dah macam
oh my god I cannot take this aku macam dah stress I remember ah me thinking that when I do my assignment like oh my god is already so stress aku dah stress gila masa buat assignment aku tak boleh like sometimes kalau kau message aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku just macam
I cannot do this aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition macam I think itu yang susah transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in kat ah secondary school all these are the teacher untuk guide kau like okay kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni okay kau nak submit kan ni kau nak submit kan tu in kalau kau tak nak submit cikgu macam eh kenapa kau tak buat submit
ah kau nak submit tau next time tapi dia dia orang tak remind kau they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay ada exam make sure belajar tu jer aku macam what the hell aku macam come on man like
adaptation is how you are ah adapt let me ah I think most people tak nak it's understandable kalau kau tak nak
cause kalau kau dah badly adapt poly right kenapa tu like you kau tak macam you cannot get used to
macam I know ah focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like macam cikgu ajar one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner lah macam you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language macam mother tongue
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important macam but then now they are making like macam oh mother tongue punya base preschool semua kan but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's macam kat movie
like macam devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
punya like thinking how they make decisions macam mana then macam oh budak ni
like is like macam evil not evil lah
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then macam ah when we realised that it's hard macam susah
serious susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung just tidur I cannot take it aku macam kelas pukul lapan we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
kita back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you macam I think the
macam kau punya record senang kau record like how to say that time aku the whole way aku tidur like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so aku tengok balik recording okay macam okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff macam keeping balik cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap okay fine
it's just seriously hard oh you know macam now is
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
I have a older friend right aqilah kan a year older then dia she tell me macam tegur aku lah
what kind of people you want to mix around with kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan
cause biasalah cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada they're going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat COVID COVID ni dia orang text sahaja it's just like ugh I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation macam okay kau nak boyfriend tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay lah kau tak ada boyfriend
that's why I relax macam okay now I realise you know macam ninety percent of my friends that you macam
my close friend lah macam kau aqilah megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe hada you know she has macam ada boyfriend sekarang kan
takes a lot of decision tau cause kau one year kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak moving along with your life what dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah getting uh upgrading yourself in a way lah then kau nak you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
betul tak unless you have boyfriend lah but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
it's different ke so it's college lah so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan aqil kita plan lagi
ke korea belajar
then we're just like come on hada then she just said kita tak nak
she she doesn't kita tak nak how to say dia nak take a break dia tak nak continue belajar cause I don't think she prioritise
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys kita macam okay kita macam single sedih kan cause sedih tak ada boyfriend
sedih dan lain-lain but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy kan is bila dia bilang aku jer tau dia tak tahu apa nak buat into the future
I don't like aku macam god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like dia nak kena get dia life straight I like I find guys like macam tahu what they are doing in life right very attractive first
susah kalau nak like okay mm we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we macam get it lah but then macam we
who you are in life you know macam eh sekarang ni school decision um aku selalu cakap tau oh tapi some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are oh I'm like
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really macam put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
and then but the but then macam to me kan the
the aku punya pressure towards myself is lebih besar
so at the end of day kan I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because macam kau already
macam let's say I aku ada a lot of thing spent untuk diri aku aku ada like a lot of
I actually single best gila sebab kau first of all aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
how to say aku tak sangat
aku tak nak lelaki yang macam sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like macam macam I have seen a lot of my friends banyak bagi tahu aku apa everyday kau everyday jumpa
macam kau okay kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas tau
macam I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like ah you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like ugh like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
bila kau dah seorang eh
kau ada banyak freedom you know kau you can do a lot of things because now banyak of my friends that break up they are like oh my god
single is fun but after two months they're like oh my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then aku macam aku tak nak kan saya lelaki aku macam ah you know macam my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if kalau aku dalam relationship kan I would take it very slow
cause obviously aku nak date for long term
apa yang kau nak in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
most of last most of my last time my friends ada contact kan can go back with aku akan text macam balik punya eh ya aku balik macam but then when ah I go back home alone
I feel fine apa I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku jer tidur jer janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay kau nak you nak makan tak the I the best thing is aku tak payah minta not minta macam aku tak payah macam
like worried keluar dengan kawan lelaki boyfriend aku macam marah eh kenapa keluar dengan lelaki like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense bila kau dah free for too long
tunggu macam how to say ah
first of all you learn to love yourself back kenapa macam cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes bila dia orang break up eh dia orang kena dump they think that macam somehow ah what's wrong with me berapa muka soalan kau kan tang is like kenapa aku then you have to over that
like time where you like okay aku ni okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
kau just macam build up on yourself lah
aku faham ah in a way and then
cause fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri
then bila now I'm thinking like at the end of the day kau seorang jer during this pandemic I spend a lot of time jer I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
like bila aku dengar anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause aku just nak text all the time then sekarang macam I like brother and my sister they were sick ah what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam call boyfriend calling ni kau tu
family is important to me macam I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
how happy I was when I was with them thing macam
my family is a type macam
kau nak faham like kawan friendship semua
macam is not
anytime boleh end
walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang eh
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
adult you know macam
aku sekarang I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like macam ah she she like how to say
location ah phone kita like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like kenapa kau nak lock phone aku macam that kind of vibe you know then bila kita the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just macam how to say
my mum just like ah give me touch you punya phone
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
aku aku reply aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku phone I aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak hide
I have nothing to hide so aku just bagi
kenapa main kenapa cause he's always playing game
so dia macam very agitated tau so macam
and then macam kita dapat balik kita macam okay and lepas tu she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what tu bukan masa aku muda-muda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
and then after that she always like lock kita punya phone semua kan then habis tu when family time she lock off kan I was like but we don't ever feel macam
cause like and macam kalau you
that app kan kalau kau pakai more than eight hours kan dia orang lock kau punya phone tu kau tak boleh buka so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause aku sahaja I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend tak tau it charge charge semua pasal kita just macam bond banyak-banyak bond
so macam aku I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila app tak ada kan then we understand now kenapa
naturally now kan kita spend a lot of time together a lot kita tak on the phone kita macam I say to my mum
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night kita watch the harry potter series as a family macam
uh like at eight after my that eight eh like all on my apa dia off day kita just duduk habis kita tengok harry potter like kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam it's that kind of vibe you know then macam but when I spend a lot of time with cousins kan I realise that their families are different
macam they don't really tak kisah sangat pasal family dia orang say
okay aku dah besar pe okay like now what eighteen
kenapa nak spend a lot of time with family
shazlin dia family tak pakai baju raya dia matching tau
dia beli sendiri so pakai different colour ah but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink eh
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay satu colour jer
then we buy like same colour and it same with macam makan tau like it's like puasa right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night ah last day usually last week kan kita banyak makan take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then bila aku macam spend a lot time macam
with other people and aku realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
they dia orang tak macam
dia orang tak macam forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always cakap why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
a lot so macam my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like macam every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this

tu lah anyway I think it's time for us to end so ya
no because because when when I made the order dorang they asked for the ya lah they asked for your options like what do you want
okay ya so the cake is now the chocolate orange cake with Nutella kan ya then the macaron my mum biar dia choose lah cause different different colour let her choose ah but she cause she
ya the colour is the flavour so dia ada different different flavour lah so but my mum choose like the colours that are ah but the the taste the taste is not that different lah for macaron manis jer dia punya taste a bit a bit jer
tak dia maximum three flavours ya so so the bottom two the bottom two tier is one flavour the second two tier is one flavour the one two tier is one
mm tak
I ah cari-cari lah kat instagram
ya I read all the reviews apparently all the reviews say the macarons are good so I try the macaron I tak tahu that's that's the thing that's why I rather take the macarons cause the reviews a lot on macarons
nak order order birthday cake first ah
ya but then but I already pay deposit lah so whatever lah kita tawakkal jer
ya cake is the ya I think the remaining I just need to find out dia ada minta macam I think they ask for two hours time frame the that one I don't understand lah I ask uh don't know they haven't reply ah whatever ah nanti ah tapi that the cake is still a long time pe the day on the wedding baru dapat pe
I don't know I just cause their phrasing for that question is like very weird so I was like what do you mean by this tapi dorang belum reply so nanti ah just wait for them to reply
ya she want to ya she want to tambah-tambah lah
ya so biar lah biar lah dia mak pengantin
ya but he didn't ask tak I I called him actually I I wanted to ask about the package cause I need to order the wedding cake ya I I want to

tak dia delete sendiri I buat macam buat bodoh like I pretend as if I never see
ya lah I know I know tapi tak nak the thing is ya we want our guests lah it's just it's just my dad's issue thing lah yang dia nak more seats hais
ya but the thing is they won't get to eat because the food is specifically for fifty pax ya so kalau dorang actually for crew they won't get to eat
that's the thing so tak kan nak kasi macam kawan kita datang abeh dorang tak dapat makan seh it's not a buffet get it that's the part that they're not they don't understand
yang yes fine I can put them as crew macam like so that you get more seats but they won't get to eat lah because they are not itu pe a'ah the food is only fifty pax what
hais so tu lah a'ah I just ignore abeh after that dia tak tanya she didn't ask me but dia tak tanya macam directly after that bila dia delete like she didn't ask me my mum ah
so I like just buat bodoh ah I just pretend like
ya then she never ask me so I just buat bodoh ah tak lah lama lah lama lah awak jer
awak jer
takpe lah actually actually the homework pun boleh buat bila bila you can do on your own timing I can do on my own timing
friday friday I takde friday I just have I got the appointment with the begum bridal
so begum bridal boleh lah if you want but ya lah tunggu my mum tengok-tengok I think awak pun macam boring juga

a'ah jadi dia tak boleh dia tak tak boleh datang jadi mummy you tunggu luar dulu
so far tak dia tak kasi apa-apa I'm tired of looking already seriously like okay you want to choose choose these two I penat because I'm doing everything I penat seh it's like nobody is helping me seh

awak pula tak tolong awak asyik busy jer
why biar lah
habis tu congrats eh message
I bilang dia ni bukan emcee emcee lah zal kau ni ingat aku nak kau bilang bilang jer suruh-suruh kau kan cikgu pandai suruh-suruh
ni bukan bukan bukan suruh dorang main game ke pe
mm ah itu ah that's why
ya lah just kalau ah tu kalau orang tak bilang pun nanti semua macam lost
dia cakap dia cakap boleh aku boleh emcee tapi um suara aku tak sedap lah nanti aku bawa sham sekali eh kalau kau tak kesah aduh
dia menggigil nanti mata kelip-kelip mata dia err err err err aku tak tahu ah err aku tak tahu ah apa nak cakap
tak because ya nevermind ah just kita just takpe tak kesah on the day itself boleh tengok just see actually all these things nak kena tanya can you just write it down the things that we need to ask like what time we can come in to start prepping like cause the cake semua nak kena datang
ya so just can you just can you just write down first but it's christmas I think mesti ada event nya yang masuk
ya like when can we come in cause we also need to plan apa someone need to come in to look look see see first siapa syafiq
awak ya ya
ya actually awak can come with me jap you mak awak terus awak dah tak payah worry about is it
actually awak kalau nak you can come from the hotel also lah
entah but the this is kita belum halal nanti kalau orang tengok awak tengok saya macam tak pakai tudung macam weird
tak or you you just wait at home first bila macam about ada timing lah so make sure saya dah pakai a'ah dah pakai tudung and all that
ya then you meet me at the hotel baru kita datang sama-sama lah I mean ya I mean we will just gonna I don't know ya the thing is because dia cakap we have from seven to ten abeh dia cakap kalau bridal use the room but we also don't have much time before that what
mm not enough time lah nak makeup
ya ya biar lah I don't think nak kena tanya mak andam juga ni like like will you follow me uh to the venue or tak ya cause kalau tak dia buat kat rumah then lepas tu dia jalan pe
pak andam usually is your brides man what eh brides man groomsman
alah kalau gitu rizal tahu lah
a'ah rizal dengan syam rizal dengan syam semua buatkan hafiz pe
actually syam syam yang bagus benda gini syam yang bagus
syafiq tak tahu ke
actually saya tahu tapi tak kan saya nak ikat awak
ikat pun boleh ikat sendiri pe
tapi saya saya pun tahu dulu malay dance pun kita belajar benda ni semua cause kita pun pakai apa a'ah kita pun pakai samping pe kan ah malay dance pun kadang-kadang our costumes we have to wear the samping kita semua belajar pe buat flower and all that I was talking just ask the person to teach lah but it will be weird lah kalau bride ikatkan samping
but the thing is if the thing is kan when mak if mak andam is there dia boleh siapkan awak juga pe if you come to the hotel room
tapi mak andam nak siap lelaki I don't know
ee tak payah lah
I think ya I think it's part of the package awak pun nak kena is it awak kena tiga kan
tengok lah tengok my mum suruh
takpe I tengok kalau dia tanya kak kau nak pakai inai ke tak tak yah lah ah okay lah ah kalau dia macam gitu okay kalau dia cakap eh kau merepek pakai lah inai ah then tu makna terpaksa
tak perlu lah hafiz pun tak pakai
and lepas tu ada lain benda ah ah pasal yang food serving
ya cause after nikah nikah selalu berapa lama fifteen minute twenty minute
mm tak ah ambil gambar jer lah abeh lepas nikah dah ambil gambar
doa ada doa kena doa bismillah gitu
okay lah so so fine eight thirty nanti uh the thing is actually kita dah short of time tau
ya nak ambil gambar orang nak ambil gambar kita
ya abeh kita tak makan ah
sekejap ah like the last ah last last eh we are photo taking tiga puluh minit sudah eh
ah okay okay so okay so awak take note err for lepas nikah kita cakap the food is served at eight thirty walaupun apa jadi just serve jer because it's gonna be on the table jer kan
ya so so just eight thirty a'ah macam eight thirty eight thirty gitu okay start serving lah like once once dorang dah they feel like nikah tu dah is okay to make noise already then they can just go
tak lah
tak kesah lah kita nak makan we still need to cake cut okay
like okay dengar dengar dengar that's why I say ya we'll go by table that's why I say biar let them serve the food after this lepas nikah lepas tu okay just ask rizal to okay um now the food while the food is served we will go table by table to take pictures eh like each person ah
ah but first of course our parents first ah ya of course of course our parents first lepas tu dah lepas tu dah continue ah so in the meantime people come people go back and then just makan jer ah like that one time so once we are done dah lima puluh orang then we can just go join them makan tapi cake cut kita belum
selalu cake cutting first kan selalu cake cut is the first kan
ya ke
eh okay lah okay lah okay then then the cake will be the last because after that kita terus kasi and then kita kasi dorang then they just cabut kan together with the berkat kan okay okay so oo but I need to remember to buy packaging to give the macaron and the cake macaron macaron boleh bawa balik the cake boleh makan tak ah plastic okay lah macaron plastic okay lah
macam macam yang kopi ke tak kopi punya ah itu okay tak lah on macaron ya allah macaron
tak itu itu nanti saya suruh siti siti siti bagus siti kan baker
ah tu yang nanti siti nanti suruh siti tolong anokan
ya so eight thirty makan table by table take photo and then once we done we join bila kita dah habis blah blah
baru kita cake cutting cake cut okay dah jalan-jalan dah
so table by table kita makan by the time should be nine thirty lah tak kan kita makan lama sangat ada chance pun saya pun macam tak terasa nak makan a'ah lepas tu suruh dorang bungkus makan
shouldn't be lah kalau pergi table by table should be tak terlepas ah
I think so confirm rizal sabo nya dia mesti sabo punya like uh korang ada apa words to each other oh okay we both have a few words conjointly rizal kau irritating okay dah dah siap eh okay then something else I want to ask lah something else I wanted to ask the venue but I forgot ya lah yang pasal deejay tu are they giving cause dia cakap remember yang pasal spotify cakap just give us and then we will play it for you
oh ya okay okay so so can kita lupa pula nak tanya pasal tu sound board ah you tanya dia like who is is someone manning the sound board supposed to be from our side or you want your person to jaga your sound board
ya so so just ask him kalau tak takpe I just standby hafiz hafiz nanti kau pergi
wait eh nanti nanti ya it's just fade down fade up actually kalau rizal boleh buat pun rizal boleh buat sendiri jer bila dia nak berbual just fade down sendiri lepas tu dia berbual bila dia dah habis dia off mic lepas tu dia pergi ah lepas tu dia pergi balik to the sound board to just ah macam fade up lagu sikit ke ya atau actually awak boleh set kan on the board auto fade down
a'ah then awak buat itu jer tapi nanti dorang tak kasi eh kalau tukar setting nampak macam yang kecil punya macam yang
it was at the corner it looks like the you know the normal typical Yamaha yang kecil looks looks like it ah but I don't know I didn't see properly
oh ya ah we have to huh apa song mesti maulidnya

ya lah awak nak cakap cakap ah
ee banyaknya
dia cuma nak duit jer buat apa nak talk to dia buat fifty fifty fifty right technically it's including am dia ikut pe
tapi memang nak kena gitu kalau dah invite banyak you need to engage an ambassador to make sure that everyone is ya it's better to have rather than nanti everyone all standing at there in front and then kena saman might as well you hire an ambassador to make sure everyone is abiding with the safe entry rule ya lah
dia boleh buat cuma siapa nak jaga macam shah ibrahim easy dia hire an ambassador that's his way tapi kita ah bila kita buat siap nak
oo I remember the question that I want to ask tukang ambil temperature
tak but ya siapa yang jaga is it our people or his people
ah just ask awak just ask put down and just ask jangan I think I think nanti saya datang eh don't have anyone ya it's err you need to ask someone from your side to do it barangkali banyak gitu pe
I don't think so cause dia tak minta dia tak kesah kalau submit name I think hotel hotel yes macam restaurant ke
I ya we really need someone to jaga the tempat seh I think rahmat have to do it I think rahmat have to do it jaga-jaga macam nanti orang datang oh cik eh cik duduk kat sini eh cik duduk kat situ eh atau atau beforehand beforehand kita buat allocation and then we update them okay you be seated at table what table what that's why we need I put I put first thirty first october is their last date to so first november kita confirm everything we assign wherever and then we can send out like send again lah macam their confirmed punya table if any changes please let us know beforehand so we can make necessary changes and all that
then wait nanti after merisik I think um the week saturday we can send out the invitation lah
can merisik is on fourth october which is sunday then the following saturday can send out the invitation so we got one week to print out whichever siapa-siapa yang awak nak kasi the hard copy then we can print out
I will I share with you ah eh got google this I dah buat schedule perangai perangai production manager cause I'm like I tengok I need to see the dates huh
ya that's why now I use mine ah I already apa apply eh pakai twenty four hours tu ya I already put it so nanti on the card ya I will just tell them to search my name ah
because when I search I dah try I signed out from YouTube and then I try searching my name just nice keluar everything mine right my account
tak I actually don't know how it works ah
I just for me pakai for me just use laptop camera can already but you awak yang nak
biar ah bukannya kita nampak it's the screen is going to be so small we're gonna be far away from the laptop
okay lor so it means you what you're trying to say is the camera tak payah like be connected to the laptop
eh besok awak kerja kan
mana tahu sometimes you go site you take a while what
entah lah
tapi fajr takut dengan mak dia mak dia marah dia diam dia ni tak dia ni jawab balik
cannot ah mesti have to dorang nak kena takut takut they need to know the consequences of their wrongdoing macam zurai tak pukul langsung
ya lah ya pukul just to dorang rasa dia punya pahit ah macam ow
nak kena sakit sikit jer
I I tengok terus I tertidur
tapi ya lah like let's same ah like my my brothers can do whatever they want perempuan aje like the rules only ya because they're they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya lah dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap ah biar ah dorang lelaki
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners ah like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered macam wow a man ya tu ah
or is it it comes from the western ah so orang tengok macam gitu kan
the children the the children will tengok at how their parents are ah nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam if let's say dorang nampak the father kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti they also know they will do that to the girls also
it's no lah sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because sekarang perempuan semua they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya perempuan perempuan wants the same status and rank as the guy so macam ya sekarang wives apa
tapi women now don't want to show that women need men
ya sekarang susah
I think it's okay it's okay kalau women want to be independent but ya but at least show lah kasi like give and take
tak sayang ah tu
ya they don't have time to dia you know you know I saw I read something like I think we should do it lah when we get married dia cakap tak I read somewhere it's macam an advice dia cakap how to keep your marriage alive or macam not there dia cakap make sure once a week at least once a week you go out go for a dinner a'ah then at least once a month go for a staycation or something once a month macam go for like like a someone further away somewhere further
tak okay okay okay once once a week go out with your family together with your kids once a month have a one to one date a'ah lepas tu once a year go overseas with the with the whole family this is how you keep ya ya so at least walaupun like you have children once a month you are having dates so every once a month if if any time between the first month and the second month your your love macam die sikit ah you will macam you will refresh your dating days a'ah so at least every once a month every once a month you are lighting up the candle you're lighting up the candle ah so at least diam eh ya so that so I think it's a very good advice seh macam I think ya it's it's it ya cause the thing is sekarang a lot of people
but ya but when things happen dah susah
tak lah don't have to be tak don't have to macam go out macam overseas as in pergi dekat dekat pun tak kesah macam malaysia you know that kind of thing ya just somewhere lah
ya it's about macam kita macam keluar once a week bring your children out is macam gi bawah main-main ke a'ah just macam every sunday ya so macam picnic ke bring your own food ah pastu macam bila dating pun tak suruh pergi mana-mana mahal macam just go out dating jer huh ya just go out like apa
ya that is the daily that's the daily punya cure ah tapi susah because I think everyone is working tapi dorang cakap kan dorang cakap kalau let's say suami dia actually dah solat abeh bini dia nak solat suami tu boleh solat lagi just to imamkan dia something like that kan macam let's say kalau wife wife dia dah solat sekali lelaki dia datang
ah lepas tu lelaki let's say the husband datang balik balik dari kerja it's okay that the wife solat lagi dengan dia just so ah suami dia macam just boleh solat jemaah lah with the wife
nanti balik ah imamkan
sekarang ya the thing is sekarang cakap senang nanti mesti ada dugaan dia bisikan syaitan tak payah lah tak payah solat jemaah pergi solat sendiri-sendiri sudah dah apa ayah why you never pray what time already siapa anak siapa anak syafiq eh ayah what time already
tak lah dengan mak bapa dia dorang sendiri-sendiri dengan awak jer dengan kita jer nak solat dengan kita tapi dorang kat rumah sendiri-sendiri

mister soput itu nak kena sebat
so it's like wah ini kalau ada uh ya can always teman what like someone to talk to
instead of seorang seorang
ya exactly then it's going to be perap in this whole room
considerable amount of space to joget-joget
move around lah at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like bersepahkan
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything semua sekarang tengah mahal I don't know ah like
I have no idea okay lah probably yes I have an idea what is is mahal now because
panasnya ya allah
then that that that's the thing price should be kurang apa should be lesser what
and nak itu pasang apa
and then have to pasang another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
the outside of the house was like rimas
then after that bersepah lagi then rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows ah tingkap macam best
kan mahal
you fikir masak-masak dulu like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like fikir masak-masak dulu like if you move in
kenapa mama nak pergi kranji suddenly
okay then cause suddenly she message me out of the blue kata nak pergi kranji tak three day two night then I was like wait what was I doing just that time ah I was like I think I was settling my mum's you know then like super busy lah then suddenly dapat message tu abeh I macam eh apasal suddenly but she didn't tell taufik at all
ah so yesterday I told taufik like eh my mum got message you or not that she wants to do all these thing then taufik was like just shaking his head so she haven't discuss like what why she want to go bila nak pergi mama tak ada bilang ah
itu dekat dengan jalan rasuk eh
so entah lah so let's just wait until mama like reply whether is it like a go ahead or not I mean if she wants to go to sentosa capella I don't mind lah cause you can use the hundred dollars voucher for that what then this one suddenly I'm like cam mana nak kata no
ya lor the the the new park royal is also err halal ya ya ya my sis is going I think in december my both my sis my sis-in-law they are bringing all the budak-budak kecil ah ada some glamping for kids inside the hotel rooms ya
ya then you can use the hundred dollars the rediscover voucher also but this morning I was like looking at the list lah didn't see the kranji one but I saw ada ada apa eh oh I saw got capella then capella you have the spa inside the room
then besides that ada apa lagi eh um W hotel the sentosa one also I mean it's a little bit upscale but then you can use that hundred dollars voucher then all of us can use together right so okay daripada kranji
eh it baru keluar ah
tu lah
eh kalau snow city I can ask any of my ex-colleagues what then can go in for free
ya nanti lah next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy gila
not son of a peach punya
err block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so masa I kecil-kecil there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
then there will also be macam ada bau tak sedap ah but okay my family tak kena sangat ah but our neighbour pernah
nak dengar ghost story
so my neighbour I think tingkat dua we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think pukul sepuluh ke apa there was somebody who came over to their house macam you know the makcik-makcik jual keropok err they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open ah so it it was a makcik selling cake tunjuk the cake all that so macam my neighbour kasihan then my neighbour pun beli lah the cake
so the makcik dah go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a batu nisan inside
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like tersipu-sipu
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents punya renovation so they just got the key on deepavali like after like one month of extension then that one also like a little bit of a merepek ah cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it sebab dorang dah change dorang punya address
abeh entah lah like very niao ah so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november deepavali is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend yang they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so err eventually on fourteen november they got the key then um we went to the house the next day taufik pun pergi the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime cuci jer keluar like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to beli the odour eliminator ah spray around a few times I think err we went on sunday last spray for the things then err I went again on monday
the next day ah the next day bau masih tak hilang ah cause twenty cats seh so spray spray spray lagi still tak hilang abeh bila I balik I was like having like a huge headache then err eventually I call err macam professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser juga so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces ah so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the masuk the nak buat dia eh
tanya eh ni ada berapa kucing ni seh lepas tu I cakap dengan dia lah ada ada twenty cats dia macam wah teruk seh but he was like telling us that err okay ah the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so dia pergi dekat switch then he call us lah say eh I think this house ada pijat punya infestation juga
because apparently on top of the switch ada colour black black black which is actually an indication of tahi pijat ah so he was like hopefully all the pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali ah the all the bed bugs semua but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be pijat or not so yes but yesterday my mum pergi dah tak ada the smell sangat so I guess it worked but
ya err the pijat is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change ah so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went tak ada the smell sangat and then macam um I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but ada lah macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat the living room so macam we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay lah but end up the cause they went again macam
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension kan so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow lah dorang tak kasi then dah jadi my parents house apa so my parents pergi tu yang they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there oi kalau I think if my parents tahu pun they wouldn't have the house lah but no momok so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa lah jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke
you cari you cari dekat which what site
have you tried yang those the punya job fairs pun tak ada
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense pun dorang will go to like some companies
aduh entah lah
or not really I mean tak ada bonus ah and all that apa ya as long as still something ah like my dad got a job my dad kan masa tu kena retire he got a job pun tu tak dapat bonus ke apa so that one is that only contract for one year ya
oh that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family kat airport for like one minute to lambai-lambai only
ya but um he also kena so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants semua kena stay at crowne plaza so ya lah they only like macam see each other bila my brother keluar dari the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his uh daughter cuma lambai
but tak boleh jumpa what is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother dah lama tak makan makanan melayu right so
he requested for nasi lemak on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for apa benda tu nasi ambeng or is it laksa one of it lah then malam he asked for bandung
missing all the local food simon to either macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
err they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still macam makanan the variety is not as much lah ya
what oh mama high class you tak tahu ke
ya but mama high class lah that time ah she was watching her japan show eh at at your house lah then she texted me err nura masa tu kita ada stay dekat hotel tokyo one one of the atas hotel lah then I say no we didn't stay at the atas hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like wah situ ada makanan halal
abeh I said but we also eat makanan halal apa
actually if apa right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb ah then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very macam open to try food ya it's like macam she said like macam okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really lah we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point kan you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
ah itu ramen tu
oh kita orang tak bawa pergi ah sashimi sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya ramen miso but not sushi she say she oh tak makan seaweed kan so tak bawa ah but all the rest dorang makan banyak obese apa
no idea ya like even the um balik punya flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
I agree eh tapi kan nasi lemak I still prefer the silk air punya have you tried ah
oh my god the silk air punya is so nice ya oh I think out of all the err nasi lemak okay ah not counting like parents masak semua kan silk air nasi lemak is like up there ya but you cannot choose what so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with nasi lemak or not
like people say malaysia punya nasi lemak sedap kan I think silk air one that one is sedap
so I was telling taufik like maldives kan ada banyak island kan like can you open up one island just for singaporeans untuk okay what
I think ni kena write in to maldives nya government kan
tak boleh eh
ya lah for as long as he stay there I'm going to like betul-betul tekan
flying some of his friends have been retrenched like err he's flying A three fifty so a three fifty ada banyak flights so during the COVID period he has been to canada he was in new york he was in seattle he was in singapore he was in melbourne err where again
abeh the later later one banyak like holiday people ya but qatar dia punya border control is still strict not like macam
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to lepaskan the requirement of the singapore government ah lepas tu baru they fly to singapore expert
okay lah not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore ah like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian punya banyak like jiwang-jiwang
or rindu family cakap dua minggu jer sekarang dah lapan bulan that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore banyak oh where is the class for this err ataupun rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through
our own life walaupun macam tak banyak benda going on but it's still like a lot of things happening
eh but my parents punya company so far quite good
tapi kan they tak hack the flooring for the they tak hack flooring semua ah they hack the skirting pastu they ah oh the service yard kan kita punya ada the that door the windows ah that one can hack they hack it out
oh ya macam face the apa the main road ke
but actually five year at ubi ones are not bad macam like my house kalau dah five year and a lot of people kan jual the the house if they take care of their houses actually it's not bad it's if you get the previous owner yang teruk tu yang ya ya you have a lot of things to do but I'm sure like if if we sell your house you will buy right
the five year one ah is one that you can consider cuma maybe you have to do the toilet ah
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles yang macam like a little bit kasar-kasar
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi I don't know where they go
entah lah like competition
ya ours macam the my sister punya is like newer tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah ours kalau you tengok the door kan yang dia punya handle is quite solid but my sister punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka
kan abeh dia punya tempat masak the hood dah jatuh-jatuh
ya so if you want to buy buy techno jangan beli bosch
ah ya ya kena macam ada talk forum
then after a few years you kena tukar kan ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it masa kita orang pergi that's why it's like um it's
um it's a little bit more atas than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the dia punya tu macam fulfilling macam very atas kitchen
okay lah I why they didn't choose quartz that time oh cause kita orang pemalas they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz jadi sebab kita nanti take the pot terus letak on the kitchen counter
taufik and I are the pemalas kind
granite the good thing is ya lah if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous pastu um tak banyak choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you kena buat sealing dia lah but kita orang tak pernah buat abeh nampak macam still okay apa takyah lah malas ya
oh okay dekat sini ada mister but I don't know whether they will have the washi tape ke tidak
okay lah okay lah I think some of the stuff not expensive ah but gold colour you better better have to go to JCube dah lama seh tak pergi jcube if I go there I will only go to JEM tomorrow jcube a bit out of the way ah
dorang nak tutup the temporary interchange to pindah to another temporary interchange kan did you read
it will be a temporary interchange again dah ten years eh
I work oh wait before I start working or is still the old one pastu I work the pindah to the temporary interchange and then I dah quit work dah three years with nparks baru pindah to another temporary and then last I read another ten years baru siap
so I cakap hillion dah siap dan yishun punya dah siap and then ah yes correct I think woodlands punya pun will be done before the jurong one will be done who the ah
ada masa the fifty was it ah fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty err apa they will move the science centre then science centre masih kat tempat lama aduh
entah lah ya I mean I would prefer at jurong lah cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be macam dekat dengan water feature entah lah but oh they said after that err they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground err ya
abeh before COVID kenapa tak nak start
apa jer aduh well that's jurong for you tapi jurong punya rumah mahal
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news kata that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is ada ke tidak
kalau you beli rumah nak beli kat mana
no it's just too expensive actually kan taufik and I were like looking to upgrade ke tidak tau cause like we were thinking lah that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over lah but we don't have any extra room what so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
we we were thinking of that but the thing is tapi sebab entah err like that lah slowly lah ya then apanya
we like the house punya location you know bawah there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery tak you don't see like into neighbour punya rumah so nak cari like really our criteria susah
like our neighbours are also okay pastu we have like area kat rumah to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so takpe lah dorang pun dapat menikmati all the pemandangan-pemandangan plants yang taufik bawa balik
tak lah dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok our area quite nice jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok alah tak ada pokok besar lah jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to pun tak crowded then ya then cheap and the tak crowded is the most important criteria
oh ya sekarang parents semua ada whatsapp chat right
pecah-pecah but we don't mind lah cause we know that you can always put back what but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam like perempuan apa melayu terakhir eh
so that's why bawa dia lah pergi wash hands semua pastu keluar dia nampak lego jer terus macam hundred and eighty degrees turn ah like oo what's this pastu ambil then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see taufik punya dorang tak faham
because star wars kan so all the err apa all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take seh and then one of the transformer cup ah you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said oh what's inside then she actually open up
and macam take out all the mini fixed ah aduh and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old pastu dah dah dah do a lot of things lah then start riding a bicycle oh dah can understand a lot ah oh she can baca ayat kursi also
ya kalau dekat schools nak deal with the parents pastu to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other wah macam mana seh mm ya lah that one is also like my last priority
what's that ya for the seven years I dah tak boleh tahan ah at least this one it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain pun tak mendak sangat
yes correct dah hafal sangat
I tak pernah buat tuition like
oh dear actually why they why madrasah tak ambil like the err trained teachers ah
entah lah I'm not too sure
and my sis nak hantar my niece masuk madrasah tau
ah I tak tahu so next year my niece three years old then dia nak hantar pergi those macam ah hafal quran punya classes all that
mm so don't know lah cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so dia kata takpe lah dia nak hantar the my niece pergi masuk madrasah so let's see how it goes anyway baru two years old seh
ya asalkan you ada education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really macam plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think taufik will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid apa bau all the plants also ya I can imagine that
kenapa tak botanist seh
eh dulu I kecil-kecil kan I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
oh I I really wanted to jaga my own kambing-kambing like like want to be self-sustainable gitu like have my kambing-kambing oh sheep sheep so I can like err jual dia punya wool then um like kat new zealand then kat switzerland ke then like macam ada a small muslim community there so I boleh buatkan korban lah dekat their
no I think I think she like macam because her life
got so susah kan so she want like
she tak nak tengok dia punya husband and new wife hidup senang
ya so I think that's what she wanted lah so that the husband hidup susah juga macam tak fair kalau
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her tapi cause that's what she's not getting from the husband what
who the siapa
dia berapa episode ah sixteen eh
but other than that I think macam the korean punya broadcasting stations all like their um
ah no sebab kan
so I hardly ever like really habis kan any drama
I actually for my migraine lah cause my ubat migraine finish already
skin condition if it's like macam he can lah
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then dia cakap can ah but
he will prescribe topical or oral punya ubat like they don't do aesthetic services ah
then I say okay I understand then lepas tu dia cakap but if you want I can try to give you like
macam the first three months I give you this ubat
because he said is not ah because I I I did ask him is my macam I feel like my face is so macam rabak ah then dia cakap
oh err it's not like macam really a severe case so I can still macam prescribe prescribe
ubat for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the kecil-kecil punya biji
ya lah like macam there's no head on top right
like I don't macam I don't see myself spending
but yours is not like macam yours is just macam white heads kind of
ah you just get from Cosrx kat Watsons ada
maybe that's because like macam depends on the product lah
haven't yet macam usually my cystic acne right other than this lah
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone gitu jer
like macam after you get you've after you give birth like macam
and then apa bekam kan muka ada mini cups LOL what the heck
even even in even on weekends right macam rare gila
I think aini macam semua turun-menurun because ayah dulu pun ada pe macam gini
you see ayah face lah or all the macam wak mak long also have like
like the bekas-bekas
I regret one thing I regret right macam in my life
my poly first year seventeen when I gatal-gatal you know bila
ya lah then because you remember you gave me the Kat Von D foundation dulu
you use the macam the high the heavy duty punya Kat Von D dulu then
no lah I'm just saying then I didn't know what macam I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation what so I just use that every time so macam I think that
but it's so it's not accessible nak beli
ya so kirakan macam
kalau pakai makeup lebih
muka muka lagi rabak even though like macam I do the proper cleansing ah
ya because like macam I don't put anything on my face what and I do macam regular
punya skincare
pakai plaster
I know I mean it's the wrong timing for my pimple sticker to habis but don't know ah see how lah later
ya kebaya
boots no I never buy I never buy I only buy like strappies and the tu
apa senang lah kalau nak pergi kerja
two bikes what then I thought like macam he thought when I get my license then I just
use that lah rather than to leave that bike all the time kat car park jer tak buat apa-apa
the high maintenance mean kalau buat delivery is very macam will cepat rosak and cepat
masalah so naz will spend more if he use that bike to do delivery
bapa dia orang kecil bapa dia orang that time datang sembang dengan ayah I thought bapa dia gini ayah ayah like lagi tinggi jer

ya damn kasihan right so macam after some time this haikel also this haikel also macam
mak dengan mata air obviously mak what so left her then the second boyfriend
also left her because cakap masih nak enjoy life masih nak party life this is like macam
have their own kecantikan
but she damn kasihan I feel like whole like is very kasihan because like
do you know do you know about the anak dia punya bapa
the anak punya bapa passed away when the aryan was two years old
bike accident dekat you know belakang marsiling itu
yang err marsiling road yang yang belakang stadium
that road kan dulu kan tak ada kan sana kan
so the road dulu kan senyap gila so macam accident
ah basil bawah lagi apa dia punya yang atas punya yang directly behind stadium nobody knows
dia orang dua motor dia kawan tau
so dia got tumpang satu then another bike is in front
so the one in front dah memang kat depan okay ah tiba-tiba kat belakang tak ada kereta tak apa crash
so it's either dia tersendiri self skid or what ah pillion dia okay
pillion dia tak buka mulut only buka mulut to lawyer
because some of them cakap oh this one uh macam some of the friends cakap ah okay the pillion nama is fir tau
so fir cakap ah dia orang cakap ini confirm confirm fir yang bawah kirakan fir cap merah you know the bike so that's why dia tak nak buka mulut dia buka mulut kat lawyer jer
but then if if it's true ah that's just fucked up ah macam kau bawa cap merah habis kawan kau meninggal sial
like then he she he never tell he when ah aqilah asked right dia just cakap oh dia tak ingat apa-apa
baru passed
ya the arwah
then she like she ceritakan me ah the whole like the macam
cakap nak tidur habis tiba-tiba like one hour later dapat call from the friend
the friend cakap err apa like mirza dah tak ada
then dia macam huh
she's twenty six so ya she gave birth at sixteen habis she still wanted to finish
but then oh when she macam bila mak dia bawa pergi doctor to check that she's pregnant or not she's eight months pregnant
so kirakan the whole time right dia just tak buat apa-apa ya then
ah dia cakap ah because like she suspected that she was pregnant habis lepas tu the
so paling paling pun nampak macam buncit
macam banyak makan gitu then apa the dia kata the
ah arwah bawa dia pergi
stole some err pregnancy test because underage tak boleh beli mah
so dia dah try dua ke apa pregnant so balik tu dia kata dia bilang emak dia sit down with the mum and dia cakap
ah kakak rasa kakak pregnant then terus mak dia bawa dia masuk bilik mak dia rembat dia
then rembat rembat rembat lepas tu dia nangis nangis nangis bawa pergi
err check then dia check scan tahu oh eight months pregnant
but so it's impossible right macam
kau aku pregnant eight months what I when I already I got my period
macam even the blood was macam
macam spotting eh
but that's scary I mean okay good for her lah but macam
tapi anak dia apa passport
a stay home mum what so macam like
she's not like compared compared to your mak cik
your mak cik fai fai what
chicken ya eat lah lama-lama your children face like chicken

slowly I mean at first it's like macam very cepat the effect but now
ke five years back
that point of time I mana ada keluar keluar balik lambat

no lah I think ever since like macam in his forties or
ah you know what my friend punya kakak go

then I entered the door cause kak ella gave me her her house keys lah
then I entered the door nayli saw me dia terus

do you use heat protector ya memang memang it's genetics lah but there are factors that will like make it worst what
this one is your that one ah baju ah
sandar tembok ada lah
ya but I I had one before ah but I never do anything to it then lama-lama dia hilang sendiri
oh then ibu then ibu you give ibu
because it's unhealthy punya way of losing weight lah you probably lost weight because you didn't have proper meals or what
mm even when countries macam like uh mana eh
I think I think like macam taiwan or or australia or what no australia I had a lot of good food
china but I took like fish ah cause I scared like macam the daging
I think it's the people like macam cause you got bimbo kak ella and like
the others macam tak macam nak kita nak bargain dia tak kasi chance
the toilet kan dah kecoh apa
err like it was just kecoh lah I mean it's never it's never not kecoh what with kak ella what ya
nak cari toilet lain
ya now dia merepek
madat is your mum
I call her pemadat what last time
I think she buat like macam ondeh-ondeh in daripada then the bag coconut
or coconut or something or some sugar white sugar I think dalam beg then I take out then
ibu patutlah patutlah you very skinny
but is he matrep no right
like old matrep eh
then now my eyes pedih because of that nevermind I'm used to it
macam when I was at gold coast right
then I just macam even though I was alone
but macam to go to the shopping or outlets all right macam kena naik tram then I will go alone
no I I didn't like macam I didn't do that but
I think some of my ex colleagues did that but dekat
colour lain colour
some of them or even yang lagi gila right I've seen right those yang pergi athens flight
habis lepas tu tak salah is three or four nights there layover then they will go to santorini
tak penat ke kan
tak ah I think it's not ah
eh terkeluar eh babi
no lah later if my eye berair all
ya can make your bulu ketiak straight also
sterilise ah kononnya
you know malaysians have this malaysians have like some cream treatment like macam they inject shit into their face
so macam a bit hypocrite
I baru makan tiga hari
masih ada it's still selling at baraqah
but I don't feel like macam I just wanted to try this first
ya Odella made me lose weight because I shit a lot I shit sampai air watery
my err itu ah immune
oh you didn't drop out ayah quit
ayah called ayah told me after tu
err what do you think boleh
is it wah just now also I sibeh sleepy sia I don't know why tapi macam I think cause the the err shopping mall was very noisy so macam tak boleh tak boleh concentrate ah so like like everything too noisy then kita pun nak dengar cikgu pun tak boleh then we have to lean remember we were like leaning in to try and hear her like and it was like
ya you all intended to macam invite orang lain or no just the two of you
oh dia datang pukul berapa
then you balik rumah makan eh
mm I like the the chicken cutlet noodles and the chicken cutlet apa tu curry rice
ya it's like just the chicken cutlet so juicy reminds me of that time when I went to punya apa tu dia punya Cheers store kan then lepas tu tak ada tempat makanan halal so I just went to the Cheers store beli dia punya microwave food then err the microwave food I I bought this japanese curry katsu rice
set and then it was honestly okay just that the the curry err the the chicken was like very small and it was I think because microwave kan so it was macam a bit soggy already ya so it wasn't crispy so I'm now I'm thinking about crispy chicken now ya
oh this morning I was actually quite happy cause err I woke up at what time eh like around ten o'clock ya then I was a bit hungry so tapi like err there wasn't enough breakfast for me leftover from my family so I asked my helper to help me cook
nuggets and french fries ya so while she was cooking right then haziq called me ya then then ya haziq called me so I was super super happy because like macam dah lama tak dengar dia punya suara ya so I so I was super happy so the moment I answered the call right
ya cause he wanted to take his laptop hashtag priorities ya then err ya so he he wasn't supposed to walk lah technically but like he just waited for dia punya nurse to close the door then he secretly go and walk to his bag to take the laptop ya then err he was really happy I think he sang like I think like almost ten songs seh
then like he sing kan sampai nurse kat luar semua sampai I think like around like almost the entire ward boleh dengar dia nyanyi ya so like but then the nurses were very happy lah cause dorang pun tengok apa tu dia dah how many days tak macam macam tak sihat so sekarang dia tengah happy dia tengah sihat so dorang pun happy ah
so dorang pun macam tengah motivating him like wah wah today sing a lot ah just sing some more lah okay don't need to wait for tomorrow just sing more now ya so like
alhamdulillah boleh gembira sikit ya my heart is like tenang sikit ya so that was my morning then after that like while he was talking to me his mum suddenly came in like she never in knock apparently ya so mak dia datang pastu dia kena hang up lah so pasal dia tak nak tak nak kena kena tangkap ke apa kan so then err
err then after that he still texted me lah like oh now today like a lot dia nya dia punya sedara datang ya nak nak uh nak visit nak tengok ya so he just like uh kena layan dorang ya then just now right before I met you he was telling me that like dia nak watch netflix on his laptop tapi bapa dia tengah pakai so he was complaining then I'm like never mind lah your bapa tengah
tengah doing work kan then was like ya doing work but ya lah it's okay I'll just use ah then his sister was also using his ipad ya so he was using and his sister was using the ipad lah then he also cannot use to watch netflix so now he's watching TikTok
orang tengah sedih kena makan comfort food then after that gain weight after that gemuk after that uh regret
semalam ya I went out to go to the hospital tapi I tak dapat jumpa haziq lah cause err dia tengah rehat so I just duduk kat bawah jer ya what about you
belajar makan eh makan apa kat situ
no I always go to the choa chu kang one cause I gym kat choa chu kang ya so sometimes after work I go to choa chu kang to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue err I will join is an electronic queue lah so I will go there scan the code then err I will join the queue then after that err they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box punya queue management system is like that
but err in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym ah then cause my gym dia punya bawah ada this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food oh shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets oh damn
right because our house area tak ada burger king dah lama then this is the newest one
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the apa tu the mozzarella cheese burger to other people tapi kalau if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead lah
then I park at this super far away punya car park cause dia punya parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price err all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price macam two dollars sixty cents uh sixteen cents ah ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before kan so
but when I went there I takut like because it's quite ulu
dorang cakap ada shuttle bus ah tapi kalau because I'm gonna go there at night so I takut like
uh kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik kan nanti ada benda
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut ya ya then like I think cause it was so ulu so when I waited a I parked my car kan then after that I waited for the shuttle bus kat bawah
ada like dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok jer probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like uh macam wearing office clothes ish ish lah I was wearing with jeans ah the top macam uh like office punya punya baju lah
ya then after that dorang tengok jer apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini ulu ulu punya tempat
ya so I tapi tak kesah lah so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the makan place the kaki makan tu ya and I ate my favourite err what's that called the lor mai kai ya
then I wanted to buy dia punya what's the one that we ate that time oh dia punya honey barbecue bao the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time dorang tak ada semua dah habis so they only had like siew mai and lor mai kai and the typical nasi lemak so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the nasi lemak so I just got the cause the lor mai kai itself is already quite big right
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then err when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles kan so dorang cakap uh noodles the person who cook the noodles uh only available sampai pukul enam then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay lah uh inshallah next time ada rezeki boleh dah makan
makan noodles dia there was this err it's a bit like ban mian ya it's it looks a bit like ban mian but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to makan ya like you just craving kan
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook dah dah balik rumah lah so I just like okay tak ada rezeki then ya then err ya then I ate there then err the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right dorang tutup uh pukul tujuh
eh pukul tujuh eh pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay sampai kul sembilan ah tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi uh they allow me to sit dekat luar dia punya outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor lah it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya macam in a way communal area lah tapi ada meja so okay lah so I makan there I duduk there sampai pukul sembilan gitu then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya wah ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like err cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
ya but alhamdulillah ya lah okay lah tak nampak apa-apa then I just balik rumah jer lah
ya I think so we still have like macam forty minutes to go
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the selimut then after that you just sleep ya sia it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun lah
ya ya tapi I saw kat sebelah dorang ada roller the want to roll the floor err when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying ah pasal it like last time when I tengah main netball kan I always use that roller to spread out the rain
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know lah I like to travel the world kan ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to apa tu
err stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home tidur one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay lah ya okay I need to aim to be like you
ya I I saw a few videos on it lah during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker tak ada apa-apa nak buat kan ya so I just duduk rumah tengok video like in a way very sensitive content just tengok jer ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me oh you went from then go to wah smart ah then in my recent job interview pun dorang tanya oh I think your academic background is very good
ya so like those err from what I understand is more of like those people yang dorang nak lari dari rumah uh dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah uh apa tu maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that pun ya selalu gaduh kat rumah and all that gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu that kind ya so err that is what apa tu Mendaki is trying to do lah ya this was err last year
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do lah so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the wah the interview was like what like dua jam siol ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya err I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know dorang punya volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of adab in terms of your akhlak semua uh boleh pass lah ya like macam there is no macam red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people yang betul betul need help ah ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then macam err Mendaki has to answer in a way lah so I I understand where they are coming from
very english lah like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible kan ya but then now I mean I am improving lah in a way in my malay err language exposure ya so like when I err my my question to them was like I am macam in a way
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me lah like your just be like your problem is different apa kau kan anak-anak orang kaya that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of lah my intention was to help them tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu uh they don't want me to help then
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so wah I'm like wah if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so macam to be honest in a way I just lost confidence ah like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life macam still huru-hara so I need to let it get it settled first lah don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
like it can be a controversial opinion tapi macam
mm ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as macam maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then macam dorang tak boleh they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard lah like you know like how they say equality versus what ah equity
he felt quite sad that um macam I

ya and then and then um ya lah then I just say lah macam I planning to buy him a cake like because um he wants a macam swensen nya cake gitu ah cause that time my birthday kan kita beli yang cookies and cream tu pe then lepas
ya that's why so so so I was thinking lah macam like maybe can share with the whole family also but then lepas tu like we ended the conversation kat situ like kita tak berbual banyak cause I only told her that I wanted to make something special for him lah because like like ya then lepas tu on monday suddenly on monday
ya jap it's here it's here ya it's here ya
ya so like apa ah what I talking ah oh ya and then about the cake then apa ah then
apa ah I lupa ah I forget what I want to say oh ya on monday ended on monday and then on monday she texted eh monday ke no lah semalam no no monday ya then monday like macam we just talking about some random things yang
I saw on facebook ah macam pasal makeup and stuff then lepas tu err I just say that like I told her like what's my plan for saturday so I say ah saturday I decided to just bring him to luge because I ask her like macam ah aiman pernah pergi luge ke tak then then she say ah I don't think he have been there then I say okay lah then so I'll just bring him there then like the can apa save it for other time
then lepas tu I say ya that's why it's not hundred dollar on the dot tau dorang kasi macam little by little like twenty twenty gitu ya ya I mean I read about it lah I don't know
ya I think so because from what I baca dia cakap ah like macam dia will kasi in division like they won't kasi hundred dollars straight
but I tak tahu must read again ah tapi tu pun like in december lama lagi seh it's not now lah ya but it's not like now like dorang dah bring out the news it's not like straight away they can
ya but so lambat like what ya ya ya so so ya so so I told her her lah I told her yang apa ah pergi dengan our friends like the the chinese friend
because apparently I wanted them to help me with the surprise pasal kita kat sentosa pe so like terus apa like can like beach surprise you know that kind tapi end up I was thinking because supposedly kita pun ah had been planning to go boat noodles supposedly tapi tak ada time because it's either they want it on a weekday like aiman like in camp and then or like saturday sometimes I work sometimes I don't want to
go out pasal aura pe then lepas tu I was thinking then lepas tu I just say lah like err maybe we should just do it on the birthday lah so so ya then I told his mum that we're going to eat and then go luge and then makan then balik ah ya then lepas tu on wednesday like last two days she text me she say ah she buying eh she ordering food for friday because like macam yang masa that monday
when I told her about like this plan the saturday plan then lepas tu like she didn't even like we we were talking about the friday plan lah tapi cuma tak confirm you know ya macam like because I said that um have to see how what time he balik if he balik uh early then maybe you just stay home then I balik with amirah because amirah is working she will finish at six thirty
so six thirty dah habis then I balik dengan dia so macam surprise juga apa kan ya so so then macam either that or I still meet them at causeway point ya habis lepas tu end up like we didn't agree on anything ya and then on wednesday she text me yang she ordering food on friday so means dah confirm lah kan ya
I mean not really discuss lah but then like we talked about it but we don't we didn't came to an agreement that okay we shall do this you know that kind macam we just talk then lepas tu but also because it's her house and then we we we know like I think she know I know that like you cannot just come the house that kind because there got one time
um aiman ask her if I can come over for dinner on sunday lepas tu sunday kan dia boleh makan dekat rumah kan so like ya then dinner on sunday lepas tu ah so she was like err why never tell in advance you know that so like like ya then lepas tu
ya okay ya then lepas tu dah gitu then ah apa-apa ah so so like ya then wednesday she say then lepas tu she say aduh that is so far probably

buang duit jer
cuma just
kenangan kenangan yang lalu ee I don't know I cringe
true especially this year raya like
uh kita tak dapat pergi jalan raya kan then kita tak dapat jumpa most of them so we really haven't seen them like one year plus gitu
oh I thought worst I was like oh my god no hal
can't ejek seh
to eat it because I really like the biscuit and between like me and my datuk like um
he always like uh cakap like
the biskut is biskut hospital lah dia tanya oh adik nak ke tak biskut hospital ini then I'm like yes please please nak like it's so good like macam like um
I will makan it with Milo or like or like minum teh gitu then I will eat the biskut together
that biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah] with my datuk so I used the biskut as the background of the painting then uh for the forefront of the painting like I put uh my sofa all like from the living room
like tribute gitu
so like I just joined it so I'm trying to start drawing again like I really rindu art lah
it's true it's like I I know a lot of people yang macam
they ada then uh like they
letak like all their energy into the
then their is like wrecked ah but then they are like very bagus in their
word of the day penat
it's very macam
asal kerja merepek seh
tapi sekarang susah lah because uh COVID ya then banyak orang
that masuk that programme jadi to have something to fall back on
legit lah compared to like having tak ada kerja langsung kan
imagine those lagi like
orang is not oh
I don't know macam cool
rasa seh tapi this is like
oh oh I know so you are saving the earth by not eating sayur because you love the earth then the earth need more sayur
my nenek love kambing man
she gonna give any excuse just to eat kambing
she can makan kambing for like
I don't know I think she can eat kambing for like
the whole month straight or something really seh we really have to macam kita kena macam hold dia back untuk
like from eating kambing it's just that bad but she got like high blood pressure all which is like bad ah
you just triggered my like primary school memories like I uh like my my last time school also they they tanam pokok Ribena then they they kasi like me macam
pegang the Ribena punya fruit
it was quite cool like but I don't know how the dia orang buat the fruit to the air gitu
macam like dia orang just
um dia punya buah dia like
like it's not even buah it's dia macam bunga gitu
tapi bunganya dia macam buah gitu eh
oh but tapi dia buat apa competition
oh dah itu jer
tapi cute seh
oh sedihnya
satu minggu jer
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like macam
singapore cuba try
jadi macam more environment friendly
I don't know dia orang buat like macam ada certain
just rich like dia orang rasa like that sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu so dia orang macam oh just bayar it gitu
so like they will still bayar it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents kan confirm orang macam lagi terasa macam like oh my god that is like duit like I should really bawa my own plastic bag or like bag in general
you know like very like feminine punya bags
apa seh I thought I want to like
kumpul duit from uh
family member ah like kita ramai ramai kumpul duit then like beli something
tapi right some of them already uh like dah beli like dah beli the present
ya then they buy like bag wallet gitu which is something that
I want to buy ah like I don't mind macam we kumpul duit then we buy like macam expensive like Coach or what you know like something a bit more pricey like more quality kan then how ah or maybe I should ask them ah but I haven't like ask them you know
dia orang kena ada bunyi gold kan like
mak cik tak trend ah
she just like gitu jer like it's usually like clothes like very cliche ah like clothes bag like wallet
actually boleh juga ah
boleh ah go jer
I think you know I think I can like kumpul then like buy
uh gelang tangan
because itu hari kan me and my sister we went to Tiffany & Co dekat jurong east
then actually kan dia punya harga pon like tak mahal mana ah like it's still like quite okay I can like kumpul duit ah or maybe like can be just like my immediate family kumpul duit then we just like buy gelang or something I think jewelry is like a good idea
ya boleh juga [ah]
so macam mana this considered as the start ah
oh just now just now tadi meet up dengan ni dengan rizal
dengan shahrizal
dia punya dia mum passed away and
his mum passed away is about pasal cancer ah
then ah there was err few years ago lah abang tak ingat bila ah
so ya so sekarang dia kerja dia kerja ni dia kerja jual emas
so dia ada dia ada kedai lah dekat mana dekat jurong east station kind
dia kerja CISCO
and then now dia macam work like this lah dia dengan wife dia
so dengan wife it's like doing like those like last time the event event the wife will sell those like macam those cakes
like Ferrero Rocher kind you know so he would do event lah tadi dia cakap
so dia cakap dia just tolong bini dia lah ya lah kan tolong bini dia
dia cakap doing but now masks currently is just masks lah plus events ah
probably ya because dia cakap dia ada ada dekat storage space dia ada apa err where all day he keep all the fridge there fridge
all those the cake fridge got for last time they rent so now dia dah beli secondhand lah
like you know dia check out that time
oh you know ni err beach road is closed do you know that the hawker is closed apparently
the tulang place nearby lah there's another tulang place lah
just go there because I was alamak I was so like not so clever move lah cause I was wearing white right then I eat tulang alamak it was like alamak disaster
ya so the the tulang experience wasn't so enjoyable because you know
dia ada ni lah dia ada apa ada macam titik sikit lah
not bukan macam like yang splash it was
err tulang dropped then there was a splash and I thought it was gone but okay lah but everybody is stained lah just now everybody have err something to remember ya ya
so is very evident lah that everybody ate tulang right so
shah shah then after that rizal lah rizal rizal also dia punya
ya nama dia shahrizal kita panggil dia shah
and rizal also lah rizal dia punya daughter next year P one what
daughter dia
ya ya ya tu err tu lain itu rizal
and then dia punya son dia punya son
is err in learning age apa
ya son dia nama harris
dia punya daughter is I think
ya punggol so dia cakap his house ke apa lah gitu
apparently dia cakap dia nak kena jumpa hari ni
because err something like err dia punya daughter is taking up chinese so
he jumpa then after that dah boleh ni lah I think got in err school something like that
so besok kita nak buat apa eh
ya apparently I thought like not non-halal then I see then I was err passing by there with err kak zarina today then
kak dina cakap eh ni dia cakap eh tengok dia makan dia macam like because dia tak eat all those stuff lah like korean korean ni aku tak tahu uh kalau macam ni ni dia cakap lah mana boleh makan ni tak halal eh tak eh halal ah
that's why dia pun cook pun like mother mother punya cook
ikan sepat go ikan sepat ah apa
eh dia ada three daughters
pun dah adult pe
anak dia already adult like I think
the youngest one also is like what twenty one this this sunday eh this weekend besok ah dia punya birthday
panggil family come eat she cook
balik time ah balik fetch her tuition
anyways uh ya you were saying apa tadi afikah pasal
something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got dia ada macam beberapa sample gitu
because in her team kan ada macam leader tau
so leader leader nak kena macam like
err macam leader macam uh if got macam the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier lah
so if this is a macam leader punya role lah
so tapi macam this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge ah you team leader
so they cakap lah got one one time tu
eh dia cakap dia she was in the toilet sekali ada this leader
ah and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking ah talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave ah like macam like you know
so diorang cakap then the other lady was saying like err eh then you leave then how ah
cause is like err say I also new say dia cakap like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is uh this indian lady lah older than her like master degree and all
but tapi dia macam I think the quiet type lah you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
oh okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague pun macam like eh
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so tak maybe ya I don't know maybe tak
tak stand out properly I think ya
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay apa like you know at least you know the next job
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good what kita nak orang orang ya that's why
so what was the painting yang painting tu dekat mana
ya so so what's what's what's going on dekat apa gillman baracks is that ah is there anything going on there and when the last time we went there for exhibition right
eh apa tadi
tiba-tiba ah
the first his car tu apa
more than she did that then what's that just now she called me then dia cakap dia nak apa go vivian house tomorrow
ada jer
mangsa dia kan
dah habis eh
okay so nanti next next friday dah decided where to eat
tapi I think dia macam macam weird leh
cause senang lah you are you're opening a restaurant and you are using my name eh
you know eh kau aku one thing then you use my name
oh she came ah tadi
okay habis so sekarang dia tak laptop ke macam mana
eh ya you say you want to have like nak advertise what paid by
so hari ni siapa buat all these err like math questions
there's time for solat there's time to bath there's time to eat
yang first paragraph tu nak kena bagus lah
that's why I was eh ya ada eh accountant
but last time was like very far because apa eh dia macam english camp gitu ah
go this camp ah and like dia ajar dia ada macam
err I think ada video let him talk then he see himself
I think last time eh ada tau macam Mendaki Mendaki macam apa
macam like err after kind and then like
that kind got cedar girls tapi ada ah macam all that ada
macam really smart smart student one ah ah ya lah for sure
tapi ada juga ya some some of them is nice ah nice like talk normally some of them also like a bit weird you know
like macam
then ah think we were int the room then I don't know what's wrong with that guy makan pun nak tidur
then the aircon have to be like super blast one ah then quite sejuk
some Mendaki camp right so we had like solat all that lah
you know they need to pay tahu tak I think tak payah
I don't think I think I go there by self I go there myself I come back pun myself
that one ya uh tapi he buy like those like
nak buat apa sia ni buat apa
tak ingat ah siapa
so tu dia orang lah
ni apa ni ni kira apa ni Facebook ah
ya lah dengar baik dengar they they say that now
err apa eh get the sebab like
like your parents punya house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
so tanya ah your mum macam mana
eh tapi you not there what you should be there I think you should be around ah like to hear like you know that time you were around right mencari sales whatever whatever right
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are dah tukar ke belum
kalau dia dah tukar what is changed you know
ya ya then from there then she cuma
mm so I think what you are concerned that one dah macam like stage three stage four lah to sell like how to like
now is number one kita nak tahu whether boleh
ya boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita belief that can jual also is is it really makes sense to jual
then if jual already then after that then
and like decide on what to do kalau it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
semalam ada dengar yang pasal news yang I think there is another three families yang dia cakap
yang geylang lorong something ya ya ya ya
macam macam weird ah I don't know whether it's an old
family ke apa ke kan
lah this one I just knew like here dengar dekat radio jer
so tinggal lagi berapa minit you cakap tadi berapa minit
besok confirm aku nak kena like
oh dia apa cakap-cakap oo buat dia cakap apa err
kita talk ah I see
si liza left already then talk take another friend
tak ada lah not confidential just talk about family lah family macam gitu
tapi dah cakap like
tak tahu asal lah dia cakap dia oh
sha sha rambut dah putih like I think she he like she got a lot of white hair so is like like what
jom kita bercatch up
sekolah kau macam mana ah
jadi seorang jurugambar is aku punya impian actually
tapi if I were to
like menyerah my freedom cause kan being a being a photographer is like a freelancer job
tengah cari ni tapi aku pernah ah satu kali aku um aku photographer cousin aku punya wedding actually
nasi lemak ah
okay ah kalau aku kena makan one dish for the rest of my life
aku rasa aku akan pilih makan pizza
pasal pizza tu filling pastu portion dia macam besar
okay ah not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
pastu like the most memorable meal for you leh
oof aku pun nak pergi korea sia
eh hari tu aku baru tengok movie tau keluar dekat pawagam cerita dia pasal time capsule
so macam
aku terpikir ah if right you found a time capsule ah from long ago macam ten years ago gitu what would be inside your time capsule ah
ah ah eh kau dulu art major in secondary school terlupa aku
what to do kena kerja for a living but right terpikir juga aku if manja tak payah kerja lagi for like a living what do you think we will do ah
tak akan depend on just our government kita punya government bankrupt juga
so like macam
kalau macam gitu apa macam susah apa yang kau harap macam free gitu
healthcare tu susah juga ah kalau nak jadi free
education pasal education sekarang walaupun ada subsidy mendaki tu semua kan
mahal juga pastu kita singapore kita punya education kena tinggi baru kita punya job macam bagus bagus kau tengok ah nak jadi doctor education kena overseas university ke susah juga ah
kau kau masuk uni tak
aku punya course ni macam
kena masuk uni ah kalau tak aku takleh tak ada future untuk aku so university ah under medicine gitu tapi susah juga ah pasal very competitive punya situation so if I were to join a local university ah under medicine it will be so competitive with all the kids lor
aku punya impian actually nak jadi photographer ah tapi macam
impian photographer jer macam hobby gitu
so tak nak pursue sangat under photographer pasal freelancer kan so dia punya
hmm so just extra income kalau aku tak ada apa apa ah tapi sekarang aku ni belajar under medicine so
aku punya first and foremost punya important punya course nak masuk in uni will be under medicine ataupun
kau pula kau punya course apa ah
tak ah aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah
and then kalau nak try under pharmacy pula dorang punya
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
aku tengah cari kerja ah sekarang tapi pasal
times are tough ah so I know for government pun they macam
a bit tough to find job now even though macam
so a bit lah I don't think so I can tahan lor
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan eh aku dengar that time kau kena
satu kat malaysia
the one in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia tu a bit slow ah
um that's why ah if like you want to study overseas as a melayu I think kan australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where ah the place has accommodates to what you are lah like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat itaewon situ ah ah cause I heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
so right semenjak kita kat rumah kan confirm kau tengok banyak Netflix kan confirm so macam cerita apa kau tengok kat Netflix
tak aku tengok movie eh
I a bit scaredy cat ah to watch that show but right talking about devil daughter teringat aku pula aku punya favourite show sekarang lucifer I don't know kalau kau tahu ah tapi banyak orang tengah bebual pasal cerita tu so basically dia macam ah detective punya show so they solve crimes and all that tu macam aku punya favourite genre ah ah so basically lucifer tu dia dia actually devil dia syaitan tapi tak ada orang terpikir that he's really the devil until like his face his devil face came out then like um then people started believing it ah cause they are like mere humans kan so dorang macam a bit scared of him but he's a really good detective also ah he work like hand in hand dengan the detective cop chloe it's a great show ah but it's super overrated now
no bukan part two it's like season five part one so the season five is split into two different um two different parts ah so got season five part one then got season five part two so the season five part one just recently came out then season five part two suppose to come out in like september so and so but then cause of COVID right they cannot like shoot the last few scenes last few episodes mah so in september then they resuming back lor cause the COVID
maybe can rent bike because I don't know if kat situ macam ada tempat rental bike kan macam east coast park kan ada tapi I dengar east coast park pun tutup pasal banyak orang ramai sangat orang kat situ
ah dia macam dia macam mana nak cakap ah dia macam mysterious kau tahu tak dia mysterious abeh macam kau ajak kan dia macam tak comfortable gitu dengan lelaki eh dengan perempuan so kat dalam school context okay ah but outside school context aku tak tahu ah tapi aku punya cikgu yang lagi satu kau tahu yang yang teacher tu aku nak jumpa tapi aku macam paiseh aku tak tahu nak ajak dia keluar ke tak
tu pun aku dah lama tak jumpa last aku jumpa pun february yang aku turun sekolah abeh then then hari tu aku nak wish happy teacher's day pun aku lupa
aku jumpa kau kat situ pe hari tu
aku tak ada sebab aku tengok jer aku tak ada sebab serious aku suka turun bawa pasal aku punya kan abeh aku sorang aku rasa abeh aku macam catch up ah dengan cikgu cikgu lain semua sekejap tapi other than that not much ah aku tak dapat aku ada number dorang ah tapi macam aku tak tahu kalau dorang save aku punya nombor ke tak ataupun dorang okay ke tak keluar dengan ex student tak tahu ah kau pernah nak ajak kau punya cikgu arts tak keluar
um a'ah lah dorang sekolah tapi lain lain tapi ada satu yang sama sama sekolah dengan aku um tapi dia different course ah dia masuk dulu baru dia year one sekarang aku kan year two sekarang so tu jer lah yang sama yang lain semua A-level ah
oh yang A-level punya dah quite some time ah dia tak ada dia tak ada banyak masa kan sekarang dengan A-level dia so nak jumpa dia pun susah kau pula
kau punya kawan yang best friend kau dulu kat tampines kan jauh kan
cause kan one of my friends yang A-level dia dia sekolah dekat jer ah not that far so macam to me also can also pick a place to find a day then like we just you know we just compromise a bit lor but cause we not that far right so not too bad ah cause our group of friends then got three of us so
I actually sometimes I want to see some teachers outside of school lah so like if I see them at least I can I got chance mah to say eh how you doing but because I never see them outside ah a bit sian lor then lor cannot catch up with them at all then macam susah ah gitu even during hari raya this year macam like nak gi ah apa rumah cikgu cikgu kan tak boleh pasal COVID kan so tu pun nak catch up pun susah abeh bila catch up pun macam kalau nak catch up kat luar sekolah tak tahu kalau dorang nak ke tak pasal kebanyakan cikgu kita kan lelaki
zoom raya ah it was like um I got two session ah one with my mum side one with my dad side morning we meet my mum side cause hor but our my mum side not a lot of people so it was easy to coordinate just call I three three like three families ah like mine included lor but then my dad side ah eight siblings eh difficult leh then they all very they cannot hear one another

aku rasa eh HEYTEA pun macam quite expensive aku rasa depending on apa kau beli ah aku selalu beli brown sugar so HEYTEA is about macam five eighty gitu then kalau kat CHICHA San Chen kau pernah try CHICHA San Chen tak
oh tu dia punya pearl very chewy very um sedap in my opinion tapi dia punya brown sugar nya tu macam macam macam susu ah basically dorang letak susu jer so but then I like their pearl ah not bad not bad sama dengan HEYTEA tapi kan paling mahal kan is uh not too sure eh hmm maybe
maybe maybe KOI aku dah lama tak tak try KOI
aku tak suka pearl dia ah to be honest like I tried the pearl ah it's a bit I mean I cannot I cannot expect lor cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so uh I just anyhow ah but like I buy also I a bit scared to try the pearl pearl or like the normal bubble tea lor I always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo milo blended ah ice blended or something like that ah small like that lor
shiok bro shiok I tell you my favourite drink ah is horlick cause of that I I I cannot stop drinking horlicks ah I tell you is like wah out of the place eh my favourite drink now so like wah thinking about my school food ah oof now ah got halal mala also in one of the food court so not bad ah then their mala also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken ah suddenly come out ah after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces eh then we don't know where it go
then in another of our food court got like this one like food ah I think I think this other poly also have is like um Indomie wah Indomie goreng that one the best bro that one like my go to that one ah with horlicks oof me and my friend every day right every day buy that meal then you leh what's your favourite food in school
wah but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold leh like I swear I don't wear jacket right I I I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch ah somehow ah the aircon a bit leh sekali become hot but maybe because of window open ah then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
sometimes ya ah cause like we want the space to study right after school ah cause we need the school wi-fi then lor all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late ah then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend lor then they take up the space in um in the library eh then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already what they we cannot tell them uh excuse me we need the table mah so just have to tahan lor like wah leh then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor ah sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die ah ah this kids ah
but I say ah she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also I got nothing to do mah so I sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the makanan now right very different it's like post post post COVID like suddenly she add on I don't know what bunch of ingredient ah inside then all the masakan masakan lauk lauk yang dia buat kan semua macam different so macam dia ada add add extra ingredient kau tahu tak
lebih sedap ada ah tu memang ah tu standard tapi different tu different it's all macam ah how to say ah modified ah I guess
hmm oh I like soup ah so like my favourite will always be sup daging ataupun sup ayam but then sup ayam she tak buat sangat ah cause she say like a bit susah so tak tahu but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning ah she cook in the morning I sleep you know then I wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks ah I don't know if you got try before kuih keria wah that one I help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all I help her buy ah cause that's the least I can do mah then Sheng Siong also a bit a bit pity on her ah to go down buy stuff so I might as well just buy for her lor
dekat tu dekat ah jauh pun jauh cause I in the inside I the most inside the neighbourhood mah so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk ah don't want waste money don't want waste money buy ah apa sometimes take bus ah if I lazy want go home like that ah I take bus but other than that I walk ah walk faster
actually tak I go seorang
I got here like thirty minutes lah cause you know ah the train ah super late ah I really hate it you know the aunty mak cik all very irritating
tak lah kau gila punya jauh aku kalau boleh nak naik Grab but I didn't take Grab either no lah I very very everything I just take train or Grab but that time Grab is expensive ah so cannot lah okay I no more money already
eh you text me just now you say kau cakap kau ada mimpi eh
walao eh sakit sia
oh got saga just sambung ah walao eh then the then the second dream whose inside the dream
then the baby like what how she look like is she naughty dia baik ke dia macam
ya lor so macam like got the happy ending lah
ya but so many signs eh already like before sebelum ni pun macam like kau dah ada mimpi-mimpi right like all this type of dreams
so okay my intention is that ah aku nak cakap dengan engkau dulu the dream then after that both of us can like um
but like ten years ago how how umur kau berapa ten years ago
eighteen siapa kau dengan siapa ah masih dengan azee
so enam belas tahun kau tahu lah kan sec four eh ah sec four pun nak cakap apa sia dengan diri aku
dah happening ah actually dok aku sec four pasal aku dah jumpa julie semua apa
aku rasa macam aku wild cause uh I met him towards the end of my sixteen so means aku dah habis A-levels ah
so then ah hakim and I we started meeting and then he taught me how to longboard then we went to gigs but it's like going out with him is very decent like you know macam not say abang lah but he's
longboard I even worked with him at his Sakura part time until the following year uh seventeen years old I I masuk
uh and I hope that you're still friends with hakim which I still am alhamdulillah
our english always berterabur sis
tapi memang irritating ah kan
umur dia berapa macam oh
is she like really obvious that she didn't see you or dia just buat buat tak nampak
ah seh so no I'm like okay I like definitely if you ask me now I don't think there's anything that can make me dislike a person but if I try to backward backward like zaman I more impulsive and reckless
macam kita cakap macam condescending like like kita ni macam bodoh like that then ya lah then macam okay oh oh okay this one is the pettiest reason
because he tegur ah so it make me not like him so it's a petty reason lah
ya lah ya lah it's like okay but then again because the way they tegur ah it's like really kurang ajar also
but there is ways for you to like kejutkan orang you know this engineer ah will really scream at your face yell at your face one leh like like no cara tak ada cara aku aku macam nak sepak muka dia but then
masa kat kerja right tak boleh buat apa-apa so okay lah just terima seadanya jer lah
oh ya I think kau pernah bilang dengan aku ini
she's so weird because pasal kau dengan dia macam tak ada kena mengena gitu
like and then like my friend happens to be that conversation so she she told me then di belakang aku padahalnya macam
she's like kau tahu yang ni tak suka kau then aku macam apasal
she then like I was really shocked lah cause aku really like pandang dia macam sister ah but then like
and then I'm like when I heard that I was like kesian or what like you think your tits are the selling point ah bro
ya and it's like very macam
rabak ah like eh aku oval tak tahu merah ke tak sial bising sial aku oval ha walao eh
then I ask lah who is this girl then he told me then I know that girl what she's my ex-classmate then I then I then aku naive ah habis aku cakap dengan dia ah like
like you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate dia dulu like always
stupid sia you just so stupid like you're so stupid like perangai jantan kebrek punya macam like oh you are les let me turn you straight like you don't try to be some hero and in fact she's the one who manipulated you
so ya lah but I never confronted after her her after that but if I everytime I saw her at school I will just like jeling her so hard and like actually uh like I'm not the type to
hate on girls or are like macam be enemies with them but wow what she did was something so nasty and like even if she never did it to me right let's say she did the whole thing to another person I would still feel so turned off
I know lah like okay your self esteem probably like jatuh because you know all the guys like went to me like I don't blame you for that but for you to take vengeance that way is so dirty and nasty sia
ya babe kau tak payah cakap babe ex aku dia nombor satu babe dia kalau buat benda dia fikir pakai konek jer dulu sebelum apa-apa babe
bodoh sia
I think it's just more to me it comes off to me like wah aku tak tahu ada manusia macam gini macam that can do that to someone else not that I was so hurt by it but I'm just like so
apa babe
ya that's so awesome nanti kalau kau pergi travel settle sia
oh ya and like baca quran and also kau faham
I'm not surprised that you want that because aku macam pernah nampak kau like one like being handy like remember that that that thing jatuh kat toilet
like ah but it's not because I will learn cooking eventually but it will be like beginner level so if I could take one skill that's immediate like chef level mak aku punya level I will take cooking
aku tahu berenang ah but I pun tak pernah masuk dalam ah berenang aku tahu pasal kat secondary school kita belajar
eh float dah okay sia some people don't even know how to float which I teach them also ah sometimes
but ya I would learn how to sea dive actually it's a very ah actually cooking and sea diving I feel is very doable lah can so ya but if I could choose it right now aku terus tahu it's sea diving ah
kau bayar setakat berapa hundred dollars then kau dapat can do sea diving cuma kat singapore nothing to sea dive ah so you have to overseas ah
so third skill if I could pick up okay ah kalau nak cakap nyanyi nyanyi is more of like a natural born lah so tak boleh ah kan
can ke oh kena vocal coaching
ya ah like okay some people macam like born with it like dah bagus but ya there's many cases dia orang macam vocal coaching right
right is the vocal coach yang kau tengok kat YouTube tristan is it
ah I always watch tristan correct and then his recent videos james charles nyanyi dia sedap sia ya it's nice
rabak sial babe
suddenly aku suddenly aku punya spike up banyak apasal
kau can think out of the box kau boleh ambil orang err orang korea orang jepun orang malaysia orang indonesia it's up to kau lor
so you wake up you look at the cermin and then you'll be like oh be that man be like ya sia then eyebrows I've dark eyebrows
but you know kau tahu ah dia kena bahan rabak kan kau tak tahu eh rabak
dia actually from season tak dia tak kena bahang umbrella academy umbrella academy does a great job ya kat luar because
kau faham tak he's young like no lah macam like booboos like err macam on Instagram live macam macam macam acting weird acting macam socially awkward
but I guess the ones who's making fun of him are also about that age ah macam thirteen sia so ya but then it's a lot of them so they really bahang kan him lah ya
but you know goodness kau tu belum lagi nampak
ada satu video dia nyanyi kat Instagram live memang kelakar ah dia macam nyanyi yang yang love yang love love tu but that is not so rabak also
correct cause we're like dude oh wait kita lagi rabak daripada dia kan okay we couldn't even act back then
rabak ah uh correct but then I think after season two ah umbrella academy kan
macam this season dia orang lagi banyak scenes kan and like boleh cakap he bawa the whole show on his back
so it's like even though like the bahang still exist but uh I think a lot of people are giving him acknowledgement and credit that he deserve ah for season two
padahal dia orang tunjuk pun macam the videos of him being socially awkward with his fans online pun macam pada aku like normal seh like it's just like macam
dia macam okay he has a sort of personality lah which is a bit quirky but if we see it as quirky then you will understand why his awkward not as
it can be anything from audio err to like macam you doing cartoon and then he will showcase it and bring it forward to the world you know
like ya that's why uh recently if you saw dia macam post something like hey someone in malaysia can you guys um
err say a a poem a puisi in malay err so that aku like so that dia boleh
wife dia is a like a like a brilliant also like she's some ah president for like an kind of company so
personal life cause I was a fan I was a very huge fan of johnny depp when I was in my teenage years all so aku
okay dia tak resist to adopt like so many kids from different parts of the world
and it takes two hands to clap also and also like I think the relationship between brad pitt and angelina tu pun macam dysfunctioning at that point of time like because brad pitt did come up of thing to be saying that
jennifer still wanted to have fun macam you know they were they were high they were taking weed
and then like when I see her older videos when she was younger right when she was like gila gila
macam you go out you go out of the house and then like so many girls
you can speak korean because that's the body's ability but then nanti ada orang melayu macam ah
aku faham sia dia cakap habis apa macam tapi how you learn that sia
ah ya ya tak payah pergi kerja so there's no nothing like you there's no transaction to get something or whatever so basically right maybe you can imagine the world in a in a more messed up way
like macam dah macam end of times ah tak ada kerja langsung ah macam so macam purge ke apa macam
it could be looked both ways it could be either super peaceful or either rabak it depends on the community I think
huh macam mana kau nak beli benda ya correct
jangan kau messed up dangut sudah sia you need this you
I feel like ya I feel like ya I feel like Netflix should do like a seh can just do a whole show based on this question alone like macam imagine kan
tak pernah ah singapore in general babe
dah banyak benda kita tak dia orang tak buat major it's so boring sia
but ya like the macam
imagine if they did something more non realistic like not family drama and like macam just you know
ah like that's why Netflix shows always make it what right because the umbrella academy is not going to happen in real life like ya apocalypse ini semua
okay definitely cannot be macam a one time hit thing pasal singapore satu
satu island dah jatuh babe ya dia kena macam sikit sikit sikit lah
but I think kalau macam there was like maybe a five episode show ah apocalypse in singapore kan
comedic like from there you know indian to the chinese to the malay then campur them together eh ya sia bro rabak already sia bro
same government and then like suddenly like everybody aunty uncle mak cik all united
oh he want to it could be anything lah ya like you said because global warming ah then you know factory they campak here campak there barang so like
so like using bandages lah obviously if you want to talk the islamic context we already know so we take that away this one is imagination is um ya I will just imagine that one person kena sakit
sakit then lepas tu um
ah dia sakit biasa habis dia dah mati tu kan doctor tu macam nak tengah nak tutup dia habis tu doctor tu sakit but from just sending tahu
then the doctor cough at the wife when he come back home then the wife sakit then the sakit she becomes the first zombie
then maybe we can place this selalu always the lah dapat all this kind of thing korea also already let's put this at malaysia very close home
so ya lah so then it starts from there then then you know malaysia people quite degil right they still want to surau they still want to solat at the masjid so they go and then orang masjid pula kena
gigit zombie and then very close to oh but then singapore is kiasu huh so from the first time we hear the one
person already kena then we already cut the borders so it's quite safe ya we already like
dian kuai dian</mandarin one like very cut that bridge ataupun ya correct
because tak boleh already sia kau tahu kalau macam zombie yang macam macam itu besar boleh lari punya habis sial dia lari sudah sampai dah so we have to like they have to
ya okay if they could if they could swim ah you know how singapura last time the history how we put the
you know the tajam-tajam that we couldn't let the sea the the ikan yang macam panjang ah correct
so we will go back to history and we'll do that so the cannot wah then like ya orang singapore will like train each other like macam
and we're like somehow tercampak from everyone else besides like err indonesia so ya but then this will
so bird flu semua we used to have bird flu lah swine flu lah banyak lah seh mad cow disease
ya macam case macam chronic gila macam kau once flu okay this person is going to die in two days
actually a lot of things sia anything if you do it repetitive for eight hours macam boleh merana sia
so imagine kalau kau brush your teeth it's a normal act tapi imagine you have to do it eight hours
gum kau dah dah dah dah dah sah dah sah dah kau dah over
ya so actually anything could be err ni kalau tapi exercise
cuma only maybe tengok ah it won't be a torture
pasal kau boleh tukar banyak channel kan kesian ah aku kat rumah
ya tak lah pasal kalau kau tengok different different cerita lain ah okay ah kalau kalau kau tengok the same show for eight hour then ya maybe ah
but then if like because kalau tengok ah cerita like err in general for eight hours it's not even like torture it's like it's what we do on like rest days like
ya unless your eating is like macam you can choose what you want to eat so maybe like eat sikit-sikit but
the real torture is like the person gave you nasi ayam okay you need to eat this nasi ayam for the next eight hours repetitively
orang boleh mati sia from exhaustion exhaustion exhaustion what other everyday activity that you wouldn't think is a torture but it's a torture if you do it for eight hours
I think washing your face like washing your face with a facial scrub lapan jam straight
kau punya kulit boleh dry sia
oh my god rabak gila actually anything that you do to do your body for eight hours ah
sometimes he dust it at eight hours so he thinks eight hours always like that now penat aku like clean the like you know he do the whole thing
I think ah ya I don't know why I thought of brushing teeth straightaway that's like ugh eight hours sakit sia gigi aku
teruk sia
aku macam ada high pitch moment uh bila excited macam ni so ya
apa sia
if it's for yourself macam
ya macam I
ya kau pernah other vulnerable component like you just you know I want to go on current god do you like the how is it whatever the I I also have
oh ya kau pernah like dengar kawan kawan kau ada third eye how is it for them like I I also have
ah of course wei menyusahkan sia
correct I but I don't know whether they can choose that option to tutup that batin I think
I think they maybe can but cannot go to bomoh lah go to an ustaz or something lah a skilled ustaz
I also have like my friend's friend ah dia pun boleh nampak benda so macam
it's not everytime akan ada benda but macam sometimes ah so macam tengah lepak ataupun
lepak kat luar pun nanti dia cakap eh ada benda ah kat situ ah atau dalam bilik macam alamak ada benda kat sini ah
are they constant tu or are they consistent
oh they want to scare you sia basically dah tak sui ah sis
oh I know him sia nak saja takutkan ni
ya ya boyfriend mana ni
oh I hate that everytime I ask about that ex you tak even refer nama dia kau just panggil dia misai
and I hate also that aku boleh macam oh ya as
though you only have one ex with one misai but
because his misai was the most evident ya
kau follow dia dekat social media ke tak
okay ada low key ah alright
okay so for me my unusual super power apa sia
I think ah the super power that siapa that
for like betul-betul like for bad people then like macam let's say this bad person was going to kill someone then
she can whisper them like macam you are not going to this you are going to try and believe in yourself you know
use it for really so the person that has that power has such as strong responsibility not to misuse it tau not for herself
like but we cannot macam do it for them as in for example a guy who is immature right we cannot be like
macam cheat code ah macam they don't go through the process so it's more like you are going to start going therapy
but then macam
and also macam I I get it like I also wouldn't want my partner to be misusing it on my child but
so ya but I mean it is messed up but messed up to a point that nak sampai divorce semua macam
chill lah like sort of like she rumour you tak berapa baik lah
kau ingat yang the part where ellen page pergi slice the car
ya ya ya but it's so kesian in the season two end up she never use but her husband irritating
kau just enjoy dia punya power habis kau nak use it the definition of toxic men sia babe aku throughout the movie aku just like
like get go I was trying to obviously give him the benefit of the doubt lah kan pasal dia macam
this like heroic black man but then as we go go through macam and he's not
luther sia aku prefer bluther with allison even though in the first season I was like meh but
dia tu baru cakap kau sayang citizen kau
yes one room flat but then nak kena ada conditions to pass lah so you must like graduate ini semua okay so if you haven't met that those conditions you still live with your parents
but then if you still haven't met that conditions then it's either kau can get the twenty one year old house ataupun stay with your parents
and then the last will be thirty years old which is like a five room flat because nanti kan semua dah ada anak semua apa
so it's all government dah macam plan untuk kau orang
and it's not like semua dapat what it's like there's conditions what so it's also it makes sense what right
ya that's why ya the ration is over there because the thing is with food is free obviously orang yang tak tamak okay lah kan
tapi kau imagine lah orang yang kau tahu kau tahu yang macam dah suka belum apa-apa dah pergi hog semua exactly kau imagine
ya takkan dia sapu
ya no food I think food can't be free I think if I really want one food that is free ah one thing that is free is ah ni sanitary pad
but condoms mana satu pun orang kasi free free per
so anyway uh babe uh kau wish aku lah ah untuk interview aku
eh babe thanks ah pasal kau macam berbual dengan aku semua so aku dah have a gauge
because  macam takde kawan gitu then  takde orang cam ajak but also  macam I want to like stay at home honestly cause like I really tired from like all the school work  berlambak kat like when you were studying
yay finally do you think  kita like  akan ada graduation ceremony
yeah  aku nak ambil gambar semua with like all my friends it will be memorable and
maybe but not so much lah because like I'm so tired of studying and the workload  banyak gila nak kena buat and  dengan  jugak
honestly I just finished my very last assignment then ya I didn't sleep that much honestly so I'm like taking a break  sekarang yeah
it was on my module quality management be ah  soalan dia anything to do with quality lah basically  macam there's something called balance scorecard that kind of thing you got learnt before ah it just  macam companies  guna like for
its quite a fun module ah do you got any module  yang kau enjoy
 tapi kau dulu pon kau cakap nak jadi pilot kan like or is that like not really
err I feel like err singapore airlines  rugi seh  kalau tak ambik kau cause like I feel like you very like you are capable ah of working there yeah I can I can foresee that you will do good in your job
tomorrow is tuesday right um honestly just stay at home like I want to  tengok my Netflix shows yeah

the module I mean the intern manager like yeah and the company's like it just saying that oh near this  ada students that will be working under you like that its just like it just a list lah that show that show who will be interning with me basically yeah
no no no but the thing is we are all separated into different different location so I'm gonna be alone ah which is  sedih yeah
 kau dah  carik err part time  punya kerja
no actually  aku enjoy seh
because like err  kau tau aku lah  aku memang suka duduk rumah aku memang pemalas nak keluar yeah and I feel like I can really rest cause you know sometimes when you go out you can be tiring like yeah like everyday we have to school right like even though its quite near but just lazy and but then one thing I don't like is the we have to study at home lah because its very hard to focus like I'm not gonna lie I slept during lessons before yeah
like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though lah I can still understand so okay lah but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like  aku kan  pemalu kan so dah lah  nak kena press the recording then like its very hard because you don't want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard ah through teams all
 itu ah
quite manageable  tapi macam one or two modules  susah sebab ada maths yeah  susah sikit lah hmm
but alhamdulillah ada my friend is smart so she can help me
then  kadang kadang macam
 macam err  kau tak nak macam tanya soalan bodoh gitu so like
hmm honestly I want to  kerja tapi err my parents  nak me to go to uni first
which I mean I I don't mind  tapi nak kena tengok result  dulu lah cause you know uni kan  susah sikit kan like you have to be at least three point five and  walaupon macam three point five  pon
you might not get in also because the competition is too thight you know you have to compete with faci people and all so  macam aku pon takut lah but at the same time also  aku tak tahu nak buat course  apa yeah I I have to do a lot of research on my own lah but yeah everything now is like I'm unsure I just
 pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
oh yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to  kerja kat office I think that is so  macam stressfull because you have to deal with  orang lain some  orang tak kan  macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring lah from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama  padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her lah like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this ah the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want  aku nak jadi boss
I think that will be nice but business  tak tau ah  nak buka business  apa eh
oh yeah  aku nak jual apa seh
 tapi like what kind of cafe you know this kind of you want like like like some cafe they sell like lunch kind or lunch dinner ah like rice everything right but there is also the bakery kan of cafe with the coffee cake which one you want
yeah you know  macam orang dulu dulu cakap start jer  kecik apa  sikit sikit nanti err
at the west because all the cafes right now is is at the  dekat bugis  semua jauh kita kan  tinggal kat west kan  habis cam cafe  dekat sini is so limited so we should open one at our area yeah

yeah I mean  aku suka bubble tea but as just a drink is okay lah but once its like in completing in food I think it's weird but I don't know I've never tried but just the idea of it  macam merepek ah yeah

everything is nice actually is like singapore ah but you know their food  macam it's feels more homie feels more authentic like their  nasi goreng can imagine lah  macam very nice  dengan dia punya sambal dengan dia punya keropok is yeah you should try go there one day

just like sad that her malay teacher tu
cikgu melayu dia cikgu hafizah dah tak ada ah
err cikgu suhanis is there lah definitely she's
but I believe cikgu iza will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say cikgu suhanis is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then cikgu iza make it more interesting
when nadia is in P three err cikgu hafiza she's lucky because she knows cikgu hafiza even before she started
ah teaching her so cikgu hafiza already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
when when the teacher she tak suka
see like the I mean not apa
um dia punya prefect punya tu
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance eh her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her kakak
at least she got two to her ni to her name
ya dia suka panjat-panjat pe banyak pe they go hiking and everything but then sekarang
she's the one yang climbing all over the place
tak boleh loose out ke dia
dia takleh kalah you understand or not
that's why dia main game dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang jer tapi I think dah I rasa dah better lah sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh lah dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam iman main nak menang
then you nak nanti settle the boys

they've prepared so much so half a year later baru dah towards the end nak nak nak dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat

baik lah as long as it's not so expensive lah but I think this teachers are
okay boleh

parents gateway punya details nanti kalau you dah start kerja I tak tahu apa-apa seh
the cikgu I mean the the and tasha tasha's teachers are using class dojo
like your what like what your sister was mentioning lah during this COVID it's best that they don't change classes because it's easier for contact tracing it's easier lah they don't want to ignore it because if not you have to go back and change back then the thing is our the girl also pun what like like tasha they she still moved around to
um dah lama tu
macam semua jer kau dah pergi

just saved duit somewhere lah right ya
scotland pasal outlander no lah
eh no no no no no I I don't I pun tak tengok lagi seh ya I I I stop at what season four eh ya pasal after awhile macam it gets a bit boring lah as in the cause they go from the mother and then to the daughter then bila the daughter part like macam
and ya this one also ni yang the one that I I I apa ni
then you pergi bergen
then dia pergi err stockholm
oo nurul ain hamidi teringat aku
terpisah juga ya
nak berbahasa baku pula lah
they just say yang mine also just say the mount floyen
what is ikan salmon in malay what is salmon in malay
mesti ada kan nama
I don't know kalau ikan if like stingray is what
ah pari
jingga kecoklatan eh(ppl
I I told you yang the kau tengok tak cerita yang hola spain with keith foo
hola hola spain with keith foo ya eh not bad you know and no and then they do two seasons the second season he cover like uh he did like work trips so the first season was more of macam is like a charted what is it macam tour gitu macam somebody would drive him there but the second one is like his own personal road trip so he goes to like places which are not so
mm aku nak pergi ah
and the roads also macam considered quite clear ah the direction for right
siapa yang drive kau ah
ya aku tak pernah ya I told I think I told you ya
that was the what's that the I don't know what is it called the express train eh tu like london paris punya tu
malam-malam ketuk pintu eh iffah iffah
iffah kahwin bila eh as in the exact date
oh dia push back further is it the
next year aku dah ada few jemputan
iffah my saudara
then my kawan kerja lama
what why does it have to be my birthday weekend actually yang the cousin yang got married also he planned eleven july then aku macam oh my god why is it has to be eleven july then they
perempuan ada amalina perempuan
eh ada amalina lelaki
oh no no no because that time like ah the minggu sebelum dorang apa ni kahwin I I just went to their new house ah
ya dia jemput then just duduk berbual-bual then he was saying about err I think we're just asking like the school lah ya then I said oh I'm from zhong zheng then say oh zhong zheng I I wanted I wanted that actually she said ah ya but uh akak apa err macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang then mak dia cakap takpe takpe apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know suddenly it dawned on me just now like eh macam that I know if I'm not wrong kau pula as in kau apa your primary school was in griffiths so ya
eh is it still existent dah tak right
no cause last time kan I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really macam kanchiong macam want to push the children
oh no tak
asal dia masuk angsana pula eh
what is the tempat baru
orh eh mm green ridges tampines green banyak ah tampines green banyak sangat
as in dekat blok kau ah dulu
no like takut apa
termati ke apa dia macam wasted all the recording
um ya my budak nakal dia withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything lah is because like the grandpa macam is sick or something like oh having surgery and then um it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
so the kid I mean ah over for macam child care centre punya um like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months ah and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start macam you know february
ya he's going to another school he dia kan very smart kan so dia berbual-bual lah tadi jer uh apa sebelum my shi</mandarin come for work dia dah bilang ni dah oh ah you're going to a new school um ya it's called little school house uh it's at tampines tampines station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart berbual jer like nonstop
ya but whatever it is ya I'm hoping maybe uh macam dah tengok macam gini kan maybe I could just stay for like
I told you right my my colleague apa mengandung I think dah tujuh bulan eh nampak perut besar gila then kena handle budak kecil tau
then dia cakap oh penat ah penat ah dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni pregnant macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni ah dia cakap kan of course
I mean if you handle older kids okay ah but if you handle younger kids susah seh
kalau younger kids yes definitely pasal aku cakap kan macam bend asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik ya it's very sakit ah belakang
tak kalau macam um budak kecil like play group like kau kena cebokkan nak tukar diaper semua ya you're constantly using your back leh ah
ya kita orang macam gini okay lah habis kalau kau pregnant macam mana seh
actually what do head of departments do last like last time I was in primary school I always wondering apa punya orang buat seh like they like always always in the office like you see
consider own free time lepak minum teh minum teh kat lah canteen
orh eh then usually consider gaji besar eh besar gila kan
oh banyak five K
tanah besar kan is it
ah tak potong
a'ah sia dorang gaji tak potong
apa gaji tak potong wah shiok seh bawa balik
I I mean I'm not surprised that like ya earn five K because macam childcare punya principal also they earn like they can earn up to four K you know
climb cuma cuma aku jer yang tak nak panjat
nak stay jer
no because if I were to become principal I wouldn't have a life man ya serious I've never seen a principal who like can leave work on time if that principal can leave work on time it's considered cincai punya ya macam kesah tak kesah jer
but by right macam ya seriously like
ya I mean I mean kita orang dah belajar kan macam macam tak perlu I I mean that's the thing I know they say like it's not good to have this concept macam how to say ah
it's not like um the malas concept or something but it's just the
I mean every career pun mesti ada macam dia punya progression ah ya but
daripada travel pergi ke sini

it's find clues sama lah so instead of open up the box apa kan then you just virtually open the box the click and then dapat clue dia then you click newspaper ni dapat clue ni
you see ada
ah ye lah ye lah ye lah macam lah alah itu kan normal escape room macam you dah ambil clue then okay you go to different stages okay you dapat ni solve the first one
okay then you go to the next step then go to the next room ah then sampai the end okay then you solve the the problem
okay lah tadi cuma time lah you must go you must you must really ikut timing lah timing dia macam quite short abeh kita the clues sometimes you really have to like
really tengok apa dia sometimes kita ingat kan it's something cheem tau sekali alamak it's just that that first few letters of the the sentence then you can figure out okay actually what is it
tapi kita pun baca dia punya poem I thought the poem is something to do with the poem kita gi decipher the poem to know actually no need it's just there
tak macam dia nak kasi digit okay you click this okay in this room find the three guard three digit number for you to open up the door
it gives you seven like but then we were just reading the poem kita baca apa poem ni ada tree lah ada women passing by apa lah apa sekali takde terus after that I think we took some time abeh orang tu kasi clue lah actually you don't have to decipher the poem you just it's just there you just look at the poem

kena betul-betul sebelum you pasti kan
tapi already memang
zero betul pe dia macam
something like they not not take things lightly tapi macam
ya I don't know dia macam whether sikit
previous cases pun gitu apa
tapi betul apa cases macam gini kena betul-betul tengok
macam a few times dulu masa orientation punya program pun
mm but play along with such things kalau you you tak report report lah
ah tapi patut goes with other uni tapi dorang tak report
okay that one aku kena tanya achin dulu
kalau dia confirm ke tidak sebab dia tu last minute ada perangai sikit so she's always like last minute tak boleh or boleh so ya
he won't be coming because dia kerja
the best is we we need to ask them apa dia orang prefer eh is it they want to buy first or they nak order tapi kalau order pun leceh I don't think the rider can go up betul tak
then nak kena turun then kalau satu orang order lain-lain kedai
so wati jer lah belum confirm
okay so to lah ni
if the rest tak boleh make it kan I mean dayah can join lah bawa anak dia cause if if it's just the three of us
but but honestly ada orang tak suka
honestly aku cakap dengan kau ada orang tak suka
okay kau tahu kita tengah recording
okay why not kita just give
apa the leeway untuk bawa anak dia so that macam
since macam susah sangat untuk dia dapatkan orang untuk jaga kan and dia tak biasa orang lain jaga anak dia so why not
bawa jer anak dia but then engkau lah yang kena jadi macam discipline mistress
dia complain kat kau ke
okay I understand where you're coming from lah macam kau tak nak kawan-kawan kita nampak anak dia punya attitude macam gitu
kau yang last masuk aku masuk dulu so salah engkau
I mean it's a get together so might as well you you order a dessert selepas makan there's a pencuci mulut
ah then sambil tu berbual berbual gossip gossip kan
ah story story cerita cerita lama ah
ya ya aku pun perasan
maybe she just want to lead a private life lah macam tak nak share most of her personal stuff with uh us
ya like I said ada orang macam dia okay ada orang kau tahu macam
err I'm not into this kind of thing anymore macam no reunions for me I I just wanna lead and love my own family macam ya
macam senyapkan diri ke apa ya ada orang macam gitu kita kena respect juga lah kan
sorry lepas aku dah beranak ni I will need to shut you out from my life
biasa lah mister husband
so apparently achin pun nak kerja ni
like macam
insurance agent aku nak berbual
so aku prudential
rider ada apa kira ke aku rider eh tak mail rider aku pillion
orh tak boleh aku punya
aku applied since two thousand fourteen
ya but then err lepas tu they tried to upgrade aku yang sebelum dah aku dah aku tu aku dah ada cancer so ya
tak before

aku rasa aku ada pay extra kot
macam yearly punya bayar extra gitu is it
ah ya I think aku ada aku kena bayar extra yearly
oh okay aku aku nak kena check balik ah
even now they have new one yang careshield
kan for aku rasa for thirty to forty years old they macam auto kan
ah tapi kalau untuk iya macam aku rasa untuk mama dengan ayah they have to do it manually tak tak auto so aku try to find out aku tak tahu dia orang punya is
macam macam eldershield care lah macam ada dia punya code code number
err dia under
ah islamic punya
kira macam uh let's say macam prudential tapi prudential ada yang islamic punya
ah dia more to islamic punya so she pay for like two hundred dollars per month
ya and ya aku aku rasa dia punya plan is a good plan punya policy ah that's why
TAQWA is very err kira dah well known already
maybe orang-orang kau yang datang cina cina bangsa indian yang
melayu yang tak tahu pasal TAQWA because a lot of youngsters budak muda
macam around yang achin punya age and below kan ah dia orang semua go for TAQWA TAQWA is a more to macam islamic for the youngsters punya
and dia punya agent is all those macam
social media punya influencer ya
ya ya but it's good very good tapi dia punya agent is not a social media influencer lah no
so okay aku rasa aku rider kot sebab for all aku punya hospital bill kan aku tak payah bayar upfront
aku punya government mm
dia apa private hospital ah
punya pad
but then semua hospital is like macam gitu apa even pun sama
kat dia orang ajar
oh ya aku rasa now dia orang dah

eh doctor aziz dah tua siol anak dia dah besar seh
K lah dia doctor siol apa dia heran sia
but male uh gynae is much better then female dia orang cakap
aku punya is uh mixed so aku tak tahu siapa yang akan menghadap aku untuk labour
aku high risk ah
err ada lah but no like the recent punya yang aku pergi yang last month tu ada this one new um male gynae
err kira a bit senior than the the previous punya is a female
ah so aku rasa it's should be dia lah kot kan
aiyo banyak kerja

the body all still sapau lah
dia recognise kau tak
kawan dia girl ke boy sia
sekali dia cakap ya you look like totoro sia
ada any latest photo of him
oh thirty six baya safari lah
people who work as influencers selalu macam gitu like think about it singaporean pun banyak influencer pe yang like they don't really do much like you know all the pretty chinese girls on Instagram
fast paced I guess I used to play a lot of I started with um apa tu
uh I started with BlackShot then like I used to play my with friends in the computer lab when the teacher wasn't looking then we started playing BlackShot together then from then I started playing two like I got tell you before right I started playing two with my uh primary school guy friends cause we used to walk back from together then you know sama-sama right then when you get back home also we together we play like two together lah then we didn't study much but that's besides the point then uh I remember one time like he was teaching me how to
I stopped playing for a while oh no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school punya clique kan then kita used to go to his house like my friend's name is hadziq then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then dah kecil kan then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller eh the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
like he really he really suka macam game game lah macam gitu then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators uh into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
better like it's pretty good ah I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know dah biasa
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested lah then one time they ajak me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad lah I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because uh I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun apa tu uh selalunya selepas exam or selepas sekolah then kita just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then kita makan sama-sama then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together lor it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn ah it was really nice lah I like thinking about it
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design sikit-sikit
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to uh my makcik's house siapa eh
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like kalau
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered uh Stardew Valley the one that's macam uh Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
tak ah aku beli kat uh you know
ya then dia orang ada website pe so I just searched up the game there then aku cari cari cari and I think kena like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like aku faham ah like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like uh searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then uh apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook lor I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
if I send an email also maybe tak baca that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
days gone by punya era like the retro punya ah
aku order march kan then sekarang dah
like dah nak dekat november
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me lah I think they just genuinely forgot about it then uh I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then macam paiseh sikit to you know
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy sikit
january like even before my birthday seh then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good lah maknanya like they get to
abeh kalau bukan april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because set lin's brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese oh ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird set lin ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then uh if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war lah like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about lor it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought lah like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know macam sedih lah to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
malaysia tak tahu honestly tak ada ah thailand thailand dia orang macam draw lots sia I think I remember cause apa itu bam bam went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt macam hunger games seh honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then hantar letter kirakan like so
so pelik to have everyone there macam
oh yang uh grave of the fireflies
itu sedih gila sia no it's because macam it's
my uh apa itu arwah nyai uh she came from indonesia then dia naik
aku ingat dulu kan it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she naik sampan sampan kecil dari indonesia jawa like she took that sampan all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my arwah datuk was a security guard or something ya
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely macam apa eh uh mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers lah then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know lah like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then makan apa-apa jer lah cari dapat daun ke apa then ambil jer lah makan jer
ya then she but they always tried to have lauk lah like uh even back then you know
in canteens or something people selalu makan nasi taruk kicap kan but
like even back then I don't know why ah but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one kuah to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my arwah nyai didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something lah had something there to eat together then ration out lor as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a sampan kecil aku I swear I ingat I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a sampan right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like huh how she fit inside the sampan then she said oh like the same way everyone else does ah you just squeeze together then just hope for the best ah then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay lah if my arwah nyai didn't come to singapore in that sampan I would still be
jawa so
but my mum a bit merepek seh like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
uh apa eh
macam tak kena ah ah
mm okay ah four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then um there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful lah they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know ah she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you kahwin orang kaya or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
you know cause of the water and then like kasihan lah cause
I think belum eh
ya uh for I read somewhere I think on reddit uh ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer lah but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know mm politics macam confusing ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school ada yang pergi uh mana
ya international school lah so they're kaya gila lagipun we were supposed to go overseas
tiga kali seh supposed to go overseas bangkok tak jadi then malaysia tak jadi then japan pun tak jadi
I think yang paling heart pain was that we couldn't see the tokyo olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay lah memang kita boleh pergi japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then dah lah like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
aku pun I mean like I was willing to settle for kita just stay in malaysia overnight seh or like for a few nights then to pun tak boleh literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
sedih gila it wasn't even just border tutup seh border tutup then circuit breaker fuh terus my my mood just plummeted
then next year internship dengan mampus
okay alamak leceh ah tadi dah sedap-sedap berbual itu lah dah nak dekat tiga minit kita berbual nak buang air liur jer
kenapa angelina tak nak ambil ini eh diploma in apa diploma in children punya studies apa
tapi it takes time apa masa of course like everyone I think like that lah I think macam eventually kalau macam dah get used to it nanti dah tak awkward apa
oh dah submit eh
habis izz nanti ni ah
ulang-alik ulang-alik ah ambil
kat mana eh poly mana
nanti kakak bulan tiga kakak dah start kakak punya course
kat bras basah and err tu yang course yang dia orang nak hantar ni advance certificate in earliest
ah dia orang nak hantar tak certificate tapi by right kakak punya actually I can
I can apply for another cert ah certificate in early childhood tapi kakak tak tahu kenapa the company sent me for this advanced certificate in early years which is err ni ah I think dia orang punya difference is
gaji wise
actually I prefer to take ace apa the other cert the pasal with that cert I actually can teach older children ah
pasal kalau kakak ambil one there's only a limit I can only take err handle kids two months to eighteen months jer
I cannot go for those older kids teach them eh curriculum tak boleh why kalau infant
kita nak ajar apa seh
tu ah tidur kasi makan
tapi tapi ah yang childcare aniq kan offer kakak dia cakap nanti after your course eh ah after you serve your one year punya bond with your company you come and look for me lah dia cakap tadi dia cakap dengan kakak
tapi I prefer here pasal dia orang punya
okay pasal every different different school they have their own different approach tau nak ajar so for this school is play based
my company they focus more on relationship base habis tadi kakak tanya principal principal cakap what is the relationship based curriculum
tak tahu it's just more communication ah with you and the kids ah so but I still prefer nya method because it's play based student learn develop through play
cakap habis dia macam ya whatever lepas tu dia macam why don't you come and work for me lah after your one year punya bond lah
I cakap inshallah lah lepas tu I cakap tapi the plus the downside is dia orang tak sponsor for studies the reason why I take up this company is because dia orang sponsor
go for it eh tapi macam
nak tahu juga dia punya pay wise is it
then tak payah kerja dulu lah since you like belum ada komitmen kan belum ada anak
just go for full time studies jer lah dah kumpul cukup duit tak if you dah kumpul cukup duit then you just go for full time studies better for you because cepat habis instead of that one year maybe six months
of course lah definitely lah that time kakak kan cakap dengan izurin lah kan yang masa korang kahwin kan I told izz if you want to apply for house I can actually recommend the agent okay the agent cakap dengan kakak for now izz tak boleh beli rumah yang
dia punya income now is actually not enough to buy a four room dia actually nak apply rumah four room daerah rumah kakak yang lama tu dekat kan
then err dia cakap then where can he apply lah but actually izz can only get rumah yang dekat boon lay taman jurong dia macam rumah lama old flat lah really old flat
ah tapi macam tempat dia pun not
cakap macam the area not really that
cakap tak apa lah then ah izz cakap tak apa lah tunggu lah tunggu then dah kahwin mana tahu dapat boleh apply
lagi ni but I guess I think sekarang market pun more for buyer punya seller market kira seller untung ah buyer kena keluarkan lebih sikit duit
sembarang sahaja lah cakap sahaja lah janji boleh hit that one hour nya ni minute
ni lagi satu nampak benda bukan-bukan semua pakai tudung jer aku tengok
itu lah I think kakak kak ika ah yang mak cakap yang tadi kita berbual kak ika ah menantu menantu wak jenab
toast belt toast box eh ah toast box ke apa yang kedai makan yang ada jual roti kaya ada breakfast pagi punya ada telur rebus
ah mak suka lopong dekat situ kakak tak tahu kenapa cakap dengan mak mak tidur ni tak jatuh ke dekat tepi mak cakap susah nanti nak nak sapu sampah cakap sapu jer lah
berat lah nak angkat-angkat cuba kakak suruh mak buang ni
this one dah lama sini masa kita baru masuk sini kan pindah was like in two thousand
two thousand berapa eh
two thousand one two thousand lepas kakak habis sekolah kan
two thousand one tak salah kakak kita pindah baru dah berapa lama sekarang dah I think twenty years
ah tadi angelia nak cakap apa
yang yang pakai ada bangs eh tudung
of course lah izz tak bawa pergi jalan-jalan macam mana nak pergi COVID
dia cakap apa tak cakap ah tak berbual lah
tu lah kak ika she's not a local she I don't know whether she's already converted to singapore citizen pasal dia dia daripada batam she's an indonesian she's an indonesian
but dia punya berbual you can actually know that she's not here she's not from here dia ada masih walaupun dia sekarang dah
dia dah tinggal lama dekat sini kan but then her accent still have that that that indonesian accent ya
dia tinggal dekat boon lay kan dengan wak jenab

abang baby nombor dua eh abang ram nombor dua nombor tiga yang bongsu abang baby
the first one tak ada

dia macam suka main handphone pasal kakak perasan ah bila macam kakak pergi outdoor activity ada dengan class dia dengan kawan dia on the handphone tak jaga budak-budak budak main-main dia on the handphone
kena complaint lah kan sikit hari kan kita ada this centre planning day right ah last week so the the principal brought up all the feedback from the parents ah so dia indicate ada one of the parents ah teachers always on the phone terus kakak cakap wow okay sekali bila kakak jalan kakak pasal kakak keluar dengan lagi dua orang kan two more teachers so like the my friend was like pointing ah at my colleague dia cakap
handphone dia tunjuk tangan begini handphone lah this one lah this one handphone lah habis macam oh okay yang kena complaint dia orang lah dua ni
senyap hmm
sama sama jer like no difference jer like normal lah
ah tapi
tak lah okay jer
tak all the pregnancy macam okay jer tak ada apa-apa jer macam I don't have any anxiety bila nak beranak
macam okay lah beranak beranak okay lah lah beranak ah I don't know why some people eh macam very nervous ah nervous padahal macam tak ada apa-apa jer macam kan macam is it just me or what like err ya tak ada masalah apa-apa just like lay in a bit lepas tu cakap oh time nak sakit sakit lah but the first
I use epidural ah because they said it's very painful very painful I cakap oh I I I don't have eh for mesti tak boleh handle punya lah so cakap ah so when the doctor asks
nak pakai epidural tak then I just say go yes epidural that's why bila macam I mm mm I got one friend off of four pregnancies she never used epidural tapi dia cakap sakit memang sakit lah tapi bila bila masuk beranakkan anaqi
I didn't get to use the epidural apa
then lepas tu I macam it's not really that painful what a'ah ah pasal
err on that day itself yang err abang nasir nasib baik abang nasir tak kerja
so lepas kakak ada macam this craving nak makan sambal pizza sambal pizza ikan bilis tau macam Domino's nya that time so I ate that then macam sakit perut cakap ah nak berak dah tau padahal dah dah due date itself so tak terfikir nak patah balik hospital
so ah then kakak nak tidur lah cakap sakit perut macam nak berak tapi tak berak ah tidur ah tidur sekali macam bangun pukul tujuh lebih eh tujuh setengah like that cakap eh kenapa macam lain macam tau sakit perut macam nak meneran-meneran so I pergi toilet tak keluar pun eh then sakit perut dia macam semacam macam datang tiba-tiba sakit dia contraction cakap eh ni ah maybe this is the time lah
pergi dengan lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir I think we need to go to hospital send send the kids dekat dalam kereta kakak tak boleh tahan tau macam tak boleh jalan cakap eh sakit perut semacam lah
lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir ah err tak boleh tahan ah so along the way pergi dari sini rumah mak pergi
abang nasir kita kakak dah diam tau pasal abang nasir try to talk to me then I just like don't want to reply cakap ah err ya lah um macam please don't talk to me because I don't have the mood to talk I cakap itu ah so on the way I tengok kat tingkap eh bila nak sampai seh bila nak sampai this is like this is this baby is torturing me sampai dekat hospital tak boleh jalan so kakak cakap dengan abang nasir I think you have to get the wheelchair for me I cannot walk
so duduk dekat wheelchair ah sorong naik dekat labour ward
nurse macam tanya uh how is what is your pain score
I cannot say already ah err dia macam ingat kakak bedek-bedek tau cakap just a little bit ah cakap lepas tu dia macam hegeh-hegeh ambil my data err dia cakap can you walk no I cannot walk I really cannot walk I cannot stand okay nevermind lah I help you sekali dah pergi naik atas nak check dia cakap eh baby head come out already tapi kakak rasa macam nak berak ah ah sakit macam nak berak tapi kakak tak ada macam mm nak berak nak bersalin macam tu kind crying no no crying you know
so doctor err nurse masa tu doctor belum sampai pun
so nurse cakap you wait ah you don't push ah because baby dah keluar kan habis you cannot tahan apa so I just I cannot tahan already I rasa I want to push now ah cakap no no no no don't wait for the doctor first dia tahan kakak begini seh cakap no no no no sekali I don't care whoa terus menjerit baby keluar ah baby come out already ah lantak lah buat bodoh tapi actually tak sakit pada kakak
so then bila dah beranakkan aniq pun tak sakit eh sakit sakit juga I think aniq was like the less pain the least painful lah of one aniq I was like struggling a bit because tapi tak nangis lah it's just that tak boleh keluar macam I I think kakak masuk malam pagi pukul satu ke dua
then err sampai esok petang baru kakak beranak
kalau dah doctor nak ni apa pergi caesarean then I told her I don't want I think I want to walk because I feel like it's like I've been on the top of the bed tak gerak so the thing cannot go out apa
so I cakap ah I cakap dengan doctor ah can I just walk
no no you cannot walk you have to stay on the bed if not anything happen then we not responsible dia tak kasi jalan
tapi pasal I think about the same ah sama jer ah then my friend cakap pakai laughing gas ya use laughing gas tengok I don't laugh what
my friend cakap dia pakai tau kakak pakai macam biasa okay jer tak ada apa-apa boring dia cakap dia cakap ada ketawa dia high
ah then abang nasir pakat lah cakap you use this one ah tahan your err masa yang beranakkan aniq ni lah macam sama jer tak ada beza habis nurse cakap lah kat me dia cakap you must use properly you must inhale right then I said what I inhale I inhale what
abang nasir sampai dah tertidur hmm habis tak keluar-keluar dah keluar belum sakit belum habis check check the machine right kakak rasa macam contraction point contraction point hmm okay lah macam rasa tak tak okay jer cakap but the contraction got got some ni tau movement ah eh tak rasa pun doctor sampai keluar masuk sharifah how is your pain
cakap you sure or not you six already eh ya four
wah really ah good ah you cakap okay lah then sekali bila macam eh how come your dia pasal dia cepatkan dia punya ni tau err dia orang pakai oxytocin lah nak cepatkan dia punya err labour it's still the same
dah dah dah dah pecahkan water bag
letak oxytocin sama juga so doctor cakap if you are bad err I give you two more hours if by by this time ah if you never err have any pain err caesarean terus macam huh I don't want caesarean don't want don't want okay I will try I'll try my best
a'ah lepas tu cakap eh budak ni tak nak keluar kot tidur dekat dalam dah dah best dekat dalam
abang nasir cakap ni kalau tak ni kena pergi push bawa naik ward ni nak kena caesarean lepas tu kakak cakap tak nak ah habis dah macam buat kelakar habis abang nasir cakap buka lah buka habis dia tidur dekat sebelah kakak macam eh nak berbual eh tak ada orang tak berbual
beranak habis if your if your pain threshold is high
maybe tak sakit lah pada kakak pain threshold kakak memang high I got high tolerance for pain so that's why macam bila beranak macam tak ada apa-apa tak cuma I think that time masa first punya pregnancy kan orang mesti cakap sakit sakit actually macam tak apa
it's not really that painful then orang cakap sakit tak beranak actually okay lah pada kakak macam macam sakit sembelit nak berak it's just like berak-berak macam constipation that's all hmm
bising ah anaqi he's crying ah
that's why dia cengeng ha kuatkan suara dia
but you cannot just take anyhow jamu you know because err some sekarang jamu tak tak ada macam banyak mixture
err drugs lain so it's already not in a pure form
dulu masa yang kakak bersalin dulu yang urut pun cakap err jamu-jamu sekarang banyak yang campur tak authentic so that's why it's dangerous ah
because it can affect your internal organs apa a
mak lah selalu suruh makan kena paksa makan lah then have to eat habis jamu pakai jamu pill pill okay ah mak punya time lagi teruk jamu macam kena masak punya tau
okay dah boleh start
belum is it nice
I saw like it's like metallic right macam kotak like that the design
tak lawa sia
betul lah
yeah aku nak tunggu price turun aja and then I can buy
aku dah lama tak pergi ah so macam tak ingat and I don't remember everything there
whoa so so berapa bilik
wah tinggi juga ya I thought usually I thought usually the bigger rooms will be lower
mm tapi like I think if you get city view you get sunset view
not really aku everyday aku sekarang kerja aja bangun bangun and then I just like relax for a bit and then I go go kerja
pasal ape ah
oh ini yang ada Jihyo right
itu banyak juga ah I mean it's it's normal amount of episode but if it's boring then just drop it man
eh you know the what you do for kau kau stay sana for like three days two nights kan
you let's say you booking pukul dua right
then korang buat ape
ah oh jalan jalan eh
dengan baggage semua
that one time I main layang-layang kat kat Sengkang right biasanya Sengkang ada open space before they made construction for hospital or something then like it was so windy that day I nearly hit a kid cause the kid was so close I was my mom was like okay kau eh kak you you you make the kite fly leh cause cause apparently I can fly kite quite well lah I don't know why that time maybe because very windy then the kid I turn one round the kid was so close to hitting the kite and I was like oh oh oh I like panic sia cause the mak pun sebelah dia je then I was like alamak kalau kena mati aku
me now me aku
orh berape mahal eh
yeah so total hour setengah
oh so so thirty minutes swimming thirty minutes mandi
then you kena keluar
is it then they still allow tak de lightning warning eh
is it is it now sekarang the the design is it like moon festival or what
yeah lah I mean like I had the membership a year membership because it was like twenty dollar something right I I keep going there until like I just go there for aircon only at that point because the aircon was quite cooling right dia punya aircon kan like sejuk gila nya then I was like okay let's go in relax tengok bunga okay then then I go home
wah during during pandemic was the worst lah that I have to be stuck at home boleh gila sih kat rumah dengan enam orang oof
apa you say what you say
like we wanted to go right we wanted to like plan a hotel staycay dengan kawan sekolah but then the pandemic happened and then every place just kena abandon sia
yeah man it's not even overseas people just staycay in Singapore pun susah tapi tak pe lah I think no one had money and somemore everyone like no job also
cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then I was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me bilang err Nisha you need to work thirty three hours per week baru boleh earn ten dollar I'm like yeah that makes more sense lah
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work lapan hours a day for empat hari right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like as long s one day you get nine hours lah you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet I think at that one point Coffee Bean nak hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista lah
yeah dia sekarang she she's just a temperature screener jaga burung dekat outside jer
mm yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then I can kacau her after that
but you kau nak start sekolah soon right
yea like November ya October ah tak ingat
but then the results dah keluar eh like your whether you can get into the school
then sometimes kau pun macam malas lah nak cari lagi
yeah normal lah I mean you also not very like apa orang cakap like err what is the word ah oh main main blank like tak cerewet like that lah
are you cerewet no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
there's so many videos about it now then I I mean I played before lah aku pernah main dengan kawan poly I was like I want play seh like like I just want to play
you need you need you need minimum lima orang eh
mm can ask our secondary school punya kawan
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl I I must say my volley friend lah there's this she at first I thought she wasn't the intruder then dia datang she always follow me you know dia always next to me sebelah aku aje then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and I'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that kita kena</malay>ok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics lah
then once someone kan dia have to like discover the body
yeah then dia report body aku then dia bilang wah I found Nisha's body here here here then I'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then I'm like oh my god this this this girl this then I just keep maki on the other side because they can't hear me right then I just keep maki her like wah this this girl ah she's lying so well ah and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer I'm like ugh it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then I'm like ugh I hate I hate her I hate playing with her
then got there's also another one where I'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well I was the intruder with her then after after err intruder can like like kacau dia punya system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things lah so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand dekat machine itu lah
yeah lah cause this one you can like ada van then you can like apa ada mission juga you can see everyone instead I would mafia game kan macam kau kena tunggu the time only
then it's quite it can get quite  macam bosan lah
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently kalau kita semua main UNO semua right it was it was quite fun lah honestly
I'm hungry man I like oh you're craving for meat ah but you're not a meat person right kau tak boleh makan
kenyal-kenyal ox man
I I won't be surprised right if you dah kawin then kau beranak kan then you like beef suddenly
are kau serius ke
funny lah usually pregnancy kan macam unknown unknown cravings
I thought I thought you said kalau the ikan is pregnant and people don't like and I'm like that doesn't make sense
oh my god I want I want I recently was talking to Yin Shen about picnic then suddenly nak dia nak main layang kan because since that last year want play layang already
then I was like oh can we go picnic then then he said like okay kau nak join tak we go picnic but
what but what apa
like currently dia nye holiday bulan eh it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of September if we pergi Isnin
okay I think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can bincang
dia orang dia orang selalu dia orang uni course sama eh
no I'm saying like their course from poly to uni sama
they dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape
no lah I mean you can meet lah but if you wanna meet every week macam penat kan nak meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
I mean they were they were nice enough to tunggu tunggu kau punya reply lah
is it I mean I guess I mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly punya kawan lah like I also got bad experiences with like kawan poly semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda then I'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer what you guys nak makan yang tak halal then then kau invite aku buat apa kan
I hate it I aku tak aku tak suka eh paling benci aku when I hear that kind of phrase then I'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no wah I I had a debate with that with Chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
I'm like wah paling benci sia aku dengar apa that that phrase
I mean I don't I mean I I okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right nak nak jumpa dua orang like that I like I don't wanna really meet them anymore
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa then kena pakai bus nye card lagi bus transportation for adult fare is so much
eh kak aku tanya eh kalau naik bus kan straight okay let's say I want go to A to B then aku naik bus aja is it cheaper than changing from bus to or what
yeah cause like kalau aku naik bus satu jam eh if I take also around forty five fifty minutes kan it's around the same time tapi like which one will be cheaper
yeah but I feel like if if I was the person cause her her topic was what technology dengan benda lain kan I don't know ah Singapore technology thing then I'm like okay I think I would cater more towards the disability
tapi nak tunggu bus tengah crowded is a bit I don't want to pay extra money for this
hmm but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one dengan anjing kan
um especially nak naik nak naik ape transportation kan public transport
nak senang kan diorang nya apa diri
yeah we're so used to having five senses susah nak compare dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga lah like we always kasihankan but we never do anything right
forest fire not fighting fire api
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week ah there is a forest fire kat California or Oregon and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid diorang tak pakai otak eh it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's I think it's for few days then diorang kan kita nampak langit kan biru lawa their langit is red eh
yeah but imagine leh like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then sekarang pun macam you know I I like okay whatever people born to be lah that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever I'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
wah what if then they knew when they dia were they planning your name to be different
yeah confirm for that nine months right diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki right then suddenly perempuan keluar then they on the spot have to think of a girl name leh
over the top maksudnya apa
know yesterday aku kerja kan sorry I keep changing topic then yesterday aku kerja thought it will be crowded lah cause Thursday gonna be Friday so I thought will be crowded can you guess how much I earned for I I work at F&B lah can you guess how much I earned for the whole shift
tak sampai tiga puluh aja
none I get seven dollar per hour right then I only make sales tiga puluh dollar aja or less than that twenty seven I think
yeah I thought okay lah at at first I thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five I had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded kan tak ada time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then I quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then I just wait and wait and wait until pukul sembilan eh then I'm like should I wash the air fryer now or should I wait cause sometime last minute also got Grab then aku tunggu aje lah tunggu kan in the meantime I just make like takeaway waffle
dah tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang eh I was like okay I just close up everything ah
kan like err don't know you should be happy or not like I'll be I mean for boss profit is addicting right this one is like I feel like I'm earning more than how much I how much I get profit from the ShopBack leh tiga puluh dollar eh it's like twenty seven eh I was like oh my god this is this this is easy money
I I guess so if you like if for the previous two days if kau macam busy gila macam selalu ada ramai orang then suddenly one day you just just quiet your body kind of just like zone out
eh then nyari Kelly kerja eh
but usually Friday ramai orang ah like it can hit incentive very very easily then I like I cannot I don't want do Friday cause I I hate I hate it that is only one person then I've to clean up everything

tiga puluh dollar dah already the cheapest then they gave me FedEx one lah then I'm like okay no no that one seventy plus already cannot afford this
oh sekarang tak de eh
that's why it's like that's a lot of money to like kacau orang on the website
I can boleh pakai untuk makanan ke baju ke for yourself kan then go around kacau orang only

dua belas okay what
is it the shipping yang mahal atau or what
oh then you got extra fund then you kau kau pakai lah

I wanna go in november tapi now I think

malay food like nasi
but I think because of the adults itu lah I think ya
and then one room is me kak ain aryan and
my younger brother and then another room is for my parents lah so they can apa ni
since it's his hari jadi also my father
lagi lagi dia half price seh of the Pan Pacific tapi like okay lah like like we cannot be together in one room lah
but I know they baru recently just renovated tau
you know like some hotel macam they the shower and everything is in the bathtub right but I don't want that but but I know Amara is not like that
eh no jap eh
okay ni
like dia kata like very boring seh
so I was thinking that okay lah either way lah like if uh adik want to if my younger want to sleep with
uh ayah and ma then go ahead
I think I will I really think I will bangun pagi if
the artscience museum yang dekat tak

you know what you mean I I I I thought like macam the culture is
macam eh can ah like craving something local because like that is how many days already we are there
when I taste it I was like eh sedap seh then like
macam like this kind of food
bila dekat singapore
susah eh
I think it'll be my mum's err ayam lemak cili padi
because if I take that ayam lemak cili padi then can I can it be served dengan nasi or no if no nasi then I don't want it
because it need to be with nasi lah hot piping nasi
I think my I think my mum my mum's err nasi goreng
nasi goreng daging is nice also
I mean if a dish that like got everything inside like protein and everything okay lah then the nasi goreng I think is a good choice
telur mata lembu on top
but like macam like when you become her
tak tahu like I really seriously tak tahu why they need like banyak banyak bilik
like bilik dorang banyak tau like
or macam main hide and seek ke
dekat dalam flat like err
ya but kalau let's say macam let's say they
ya okay that one is already um macam
I think the face you look at it every day like hari hari tengok
or like tukar the face in like
dah sapau sapau muka macam
ah no dia macam dia tak dia tak murder that person dia tak kill that person is it
ya they want to like macam oh this is we captured it for the camera
like the fact that like he had uh apa ni err he got a mistress
err uh okay it's a girlfriend yang he knows
ya like macam
dorang actually did include
not kecil lah maybe when I was a teenager
love him ah like dia punya
especially to his atuk nenek lah because like
two people is the one yang apa ni bring you up
return the favour lah I think he really need to macam
ah dah besar he will need to realise oh eh actually I nak
I need to err jaga my atuk and nenek I need uh anything that
and I know about it happen because kita kat sekolah kan
ya ya ya that that was what uh apa yang I mean lah like
I really think yang COVID ni is like
I know right and then and then a lot of people macam nothing you know they like have a job and then the next time they don't have
macam like things happened just like that and there are a lot of people the most
thing the most like macam paling sedih that I've heard
ya that trump also merepek seh dia tu
esok hari apa no esok I have my friend wedding
is like other aside from kalau macam bila ada mask distribution then what else do you guys do
pastu buat pe
oho passion card kat apa ah ah ah ah
ya anything can happen sekali you
tapi tu pun kena pergi [kan]
whatever that you want the information that you want nak cari apa nak pasal apa
nak pasal rental ke nak about uh beli ke apa ke like short term ke anything and everything is now online
no because you nak kena kerja dengan kids kan
at white lodge which is actually just here only kat west coast road
then lepas tu I have to um
depending on the group so kat over there the the the smaller the the smallest is three years old
eleven twenty tu yang before the lunchtime [kan] I actually assisted the teachers
that's what I'm amazed and dorang punya culture is very diverse because most is all
like swedish sweden pula um
banyak ah like
ah sakit kenapa sakit hmm
uh plus yang kid umur
three to six dengan
err five to eh sorry three to four dengan five five to six tu
because they are very like macam
and then lepas tu when when she's done
err setengah of the kids like
setengah of the forty five kids yang
setengah will go home at one
balik tidur uh no they will they can the parents can only pick them uh the parents of the maid ah
half german half japanese actually there's a lot of japanese mix kat over there
and then uh dia like
dia like literally like
kat rumah like this is how I talk to my parents
try to macam
before that dorang makan so it's like an early lunch like that
makan and then
and then after that when they wake up they still kasi snacks
penat penat gila I think
and then after that um I think he he apa ni um
actually kan aku tak because uh mak aku like whenever she cook she will buka the YouTube punya
apa tu video ya because dia tak ada Spotify so she will use the YouTube ah while she cook
tapi macam a bit merepek cause last time can misteri jam dua belas kat radio kan so you listen to it at night literally before twelve but ni dia tengok bila tengah macam petang cause tengah masak kan you had any stories on your
kau kau dengar
ya ya the when one yang you were studying at home kan
aku aku weh pun nak dengar ah
keras kan ya
how sia because that time I I didn't know how keras it was until I came aku balik lambat that time because the the tempat that I live kan is betul-betul opposite the
benda-benda tu the and the muslim world
and then dia macam dalam tau sebelah ha the best part tempat aku tinggal is betul-betul sebelah fuchun primary
no no the one that I'm staying in sekarang ya
aku tak tahu aku tahu dia marsiling
the one yang opposite the tu
the the police dengan muslim world
tak ah yours is dalam lagi sikit
ya sebab tu yang tadi pagi yang aku
bangun masa extra awal lah cause I thought it was late but the the bus stop is literally dekat depan like depan block ah so I took
nine six six direct straight all the way pergi I'm like ah I came here within forty five minutes
ya but it's only untuk tiga minggu jer
entah I don't know my parents my family is living there like we just take a rental
ya so after the three weeks then kita boleh masuk the new house lah
ya ya ya betul-betul next to ya fuchun section primary so I think it's the new one ya by tak tu kat
ya tu aku tu aku tak berani because the next bus kan yang pass by that tempat ya I saw like oh
ya I'm like okay tak apa aku tak nak pergi sini
macam mana kau masuk the sekolah like is it they give you
like is it like macam kalau secondary school kan like dia orang kasi like that booklet kan untuk uh like you can either apply directly atau you go through the system kan then for primary apa like kau apply directly or
kau fikir ni TOTO ke apa
that one aku tak tahu ah because their
so that's what your what your parents bid ah ya but ya and hantu
mmhmm kau primary school ada cadet
apa seh tu korang kena belajar history
huh founder kat singapore
ya betul lah ya
asal oh okay
because my school punya like very limited so dia orang cuma ada like sports
uh apa lagi eh
I think that's about it and then when bila aku baru nak graduate then dia offered arts
so like dari like from primary school uh I was in track and field uh apa nama benda tu tak tak it's not netball
aku tengok home econs aku macam apa kau orang belajar kat sini ya they learn how to cook there was a competition for cooking
home econs belajar apa
oh aku dengar for like for the exam you literally have to cook
like oops tak apa darurat
oh no they say like kalau ha you can it's like god purposely let you makan because ya five minutes
I never studied music so bila aku kat poly kan
because in poly I joined the percussion punya band
and then there was this one part of the test where the instructor ajar kita orang how to read music tapi aku lost gila ya
aku lost because like he was teaching us like paradiddle ke apa entah how to do the how to keep how to macam ha stay in beat and listen to the rhythm ke apa because our instructor tu was from yuhua punya like some band thing ah
aku just lost so dia macam we had to pass the test and we had to learn how to draw the symbols semua a'ah
okay lah aku aku pass the paper lah but the actual practical aku macam huh
dengan flute kan tak eh
oh oh that's recorder oh aku teringat squidward clarinet
tu bukan gong lah merepek
the what rebana
oh that one is like dia macam xylophone gitu kan it's something like that lah tapi dia like circle circle
but ya kau jadi apa malay dance
fusion macam mana kau joget sia
handball aku tak tahu uh huh
actually lah at first macam macam malas kan but then after awhile then you're like okay
camp qiam ah
uh I think ada lah because we had this program in primary six yang eh kaki kau ada semut
uh and then apa tu that one kita it's like uh like you know those masa adam khoo punya camps
everytime ada camp kan mesti ada that night walk tau ya and then before night walk they will always show you cerita hantu tau atau cerita seram before that so for that for that one they showed us uh movie the orphan I think
honestly aku tak ingat because
it was quite scary because the sekolah that we had to go was wak tanjong ya then wak tanjong kan it's like
macam kampung lama right I think it was like rumah orang ah dulu
ya then so macam we had to crawl over stuff and benda semua tapi aku mesti teringat mesti ada hantu kat sini something like haunted house ah ya
mm then dia orang cakap ah macam if kalau if you see anything uh you try to find the
facilitator ah because they have a glow stick I'm like habis kalau facilitator benda lain macam mana
oo yang army I think the first episode ke second episode
oh ah yang bila dia baru masuk eh habis dia kena bully kan cause mak dia hantar dia a'ah
tu kat tekong eh tak eh kat mana seh
oh macam apa tu like ha caterpillar baru nak cakap train
so korang apa masuk alam bunian
ya is it korang like got trapped
in the tempat eh
macam dah nak siap to tidur ah
ya korang you take some time lah ya
tak which makes me think sebab sebab like kau tahu nak cakap bugis kan ada this tempat where
uh that road is called uh jalan kubur
ya basically sebelah aljunied right so like the entire stretch semua kubur tau and then it's very like rapat-rapat
it's literally next to the madrasah it's the I think the the founder of the sekolah punya family aljunied ya
oh because that used to be dia punya tempat ah like is it like the ha the tanah or the kampung where most of them tinggal kat situ ah
aku macam no because aku baru perasan kan because that time I I was going home and then aku nak pergi bus stop then so I went to the bus stop
literally belakang bus stop tu so macam
sini ada kubur-kubur then bus stop kat sini so kalau kau nak pergi bus stop you have to pass by the kubur ah
I didn't I was like how can it be that close seh tak seram ke
and macam I
ya is it dia orang tak perasan ke dia orang tak kesah
oh yang tu lah
tak seram seh because when I went to the bus stop it was dah malam
and then aku macam it was very like seram ah aku just tengah jalan minding my own business and then pergi bus stop aku nak cari bus and aku tengok tepi I was like eh kubur
kena culik eh
kenapa bau bau bangkai eh
ke just bau tanah like fertiliser
kat luar kan bye
asal eh is it dia punya no no no as in the tempat tempat mandi dia is like covered eh or is it like open air oh so kirakan dia just macam panel lah
it's a kolah right
ya tak comfortable lah
is it a real thing though it's not right I heard like it's orang eh
is it someone hantar jin or is it orang tu sendiri is the one
the what oh they send benda tu ah
actually kan aku ada question we're because hantu raya kan dia actually apa
what is it asal why is it called raya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because ada this one episode where
ada this group of students dia pergi this one area kat
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the tempat kan
uh they dia orang
I don't know if it's a bomoh but I think and then she macam advice dia orang kan dia dia she advise them about the macam pantang larang gitu and then
a'ah yang tu yang tu ha ya
apa eh oh they they call it
nananggal tak salah
no no they the it's nananggal not penanggal
eh aku tak tahu ah cause oh
oh apa they malay peninsular so sama hantu lah
it's because when I first saw it kan oh chey okay no because I thought at first it's a pontianak but then the cerita tunjukkan kan because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
ya kat singapore
aku tak pernah nampak okay okay then
which makes me wonder tau because kan dia orang patut kan they can go through
like solid objects tak boleh affect them kan tapi they get stuck
oh amal pengamal oo
tu yang aku tak faham like you would take you would pay lots of money
to apa tu get the services of
like jin dengan bomoh tapi like benda surgery kau tak nak
ya apa yang natural it's supernatural
seram ah wait then what's the purpose of the penanggal like
I know oh the I don't know what's the purpose tapi aku tahu like dekat episode tu they show
um that thing was going after the perempuan yang pregnant
I know because like one reasons is because macam like they are more vulnerable and then they are macam mana eh
like they are more vulnerable because they ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat
so they try to like steal it from them which is apa tu the baby lah it's like new life
a'ah ya ya ada ada
I mean kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua
ya itu that one just
because they they either makan the anak atau they curi the anak atau they ikat the rahim eww
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that eh dia letak garam kan tak eh garam
ya aku dengar like if you letak garam kat luar your pintu kan macam anyone ha anyone who masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda kan that benda cannot masuk rumah
maybe ah it's one of the ways ah yang ada
sirih eh
apa seh aku tak pernah dengar is it melayu punya
apa seh
oh kirakan macam
they make it into a sabun kan so senang
sambut what do you mean
eh a'ah a'ah apa tu yang the son of a peach punya cerita kan they were saying macam this hospital dia cakap
uh dia tengah beranak kan and then she saw a white figure then the nurse cakap oh that one is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
so kirakan macam kalau like you give birth
but then someone benda lain might be
cause thinking macam sebab maternity work kan like babies baru keluar
so it's seram seh but then kalau macam you are if you are in the operating room kan and then kau baru give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
oh that's why that one macam make sure kalau kau kat dalam kan you have someone like your family there so they can ha okay okay
oh but then masih baru kan the
oh ya ya ya tidur mati ah
kau tak baca doa tidur eh asal eh
oo so if it wakes you up then different story ah ha bodoh lah
but apa yang dia call it apa err it's not khayalan it's like
ya betul
the he looked up the stuff kan then he saw that actually jin dengan you cannot see jin and syaitan because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya so what happens is that because kau kena apa tu hasut kan
macam is just playing in your head so the syaitan hasut you and then kirakan they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension tau everything that exist in that dimension
ya macam that's why macam you nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak kan ya
also orang lain yang kena ah
kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita okay
wait so that's one of the ways they kacau you ah
so kirakan dia orang actually pegang kau or they just make you think that ada orang pegang kau
ha dia orang selalu buat kan macam like those supernatural punya like
ya I remember I watched the one yang kat malaysia kan where they the the whole entire team
kat luar rumah and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like baca-baca something basically like inviting the hantu gitu ah
ya but then it's like damn scary because apa tu
like the the thing will come to them right and then apa tu
macam mana eh the the pintu semua gerak and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to dia punya the team outside right
like usually when they go out they we have like a a bomoh on standby gitu ya
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like dia orang macam trembling or shivering or they say like dia orang ada rasa benda
ya why ah is it like singapore like dia orang tak kacau sangat
so you telling me that the hantu also like shifted back to the kampung then oh it became less popular eh less demand
oh I think it's because like is it like people in singapore tak practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources juga ah ya really like maybe ada memang ada lah but like
and like the pantang larang for bomoh right is more
ya it's so leceh satu and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it kan but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
like kan dia cakap tak boleh you cannot walk under the galah but then kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah kot
I I thought they use the clothes line the string tak eh
and kenapa galah like aku aku tak faham huh what's that
properties ah then what if it's made out of metal atau plastic
no bila macam those extendable galah kan that one made of metal what no meh
like you will perah the thing first what before you gantung
kau tau jemur ke apa ya
so kirakan like when you absent-mindedly walked under the galah lah ha
what's eh wait but for susuk kalau terkeluar you can just masukkan balik kan
it's macam mana eh it's it's this actual peniti kan something like that
I know like there used to be this show dekat suria where
where they show no not cerita hantu it's
err they ya ya so one of it is susuk they show like how the bomoh will masukkan the susuk then they will like oh it's sakit sikit tau so they masukkan
and then like if kalau kau histeria kan you can see the needles in your face
but then macam but they say like kalau the person who the person who masukkan
is the only person who can keluarkan
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the galah and then dia jatuh sendiri ah
it's either you cannot die or cause susah nak mati like the nazak right
but tetap can die lah so okay ah
because if you cannot die ah habis suffer like that
so tak mati ah oh take it out
the kafan and everything
ya but it's like you tangan semua
bodoh sejuk siol
dah lah tak tak pakai stokin
wait so they don't they don't bury you with kain batik kain batik is before kan
the funeral right oh chey ya so kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik ah
nasi lemak oh tak ah no no no because kan
kalau kau dah keluarkan the
batik kan would you want to still use the batik
atau like the the the soil wouldn't stay right ya
err she said like ni orang-orang dulu kata ah macam if you are at the funeral kan jangan diri depan kaki mayat because in case kalau bukan-bukan kalau like the person pernah ada simpan barang kan they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is ah but
ya but I thought like kalau
so if like they ask you ya that's what I thought ah my mum you supposed to pass the thing bila dia masa hidup kan not bila dah mati
no as in the roof is what boleh buka oh okay okay okay
oh my god my mum like the interview she said like uh she would work right and then she would take leave then when her ask when her friends asked her like eh you took leave where you go the she said I won't go I'm gonna stay home and gosok baju and then aku macam ya she did I was like then what do you do for fun no lah I just stay home ah if my friends invite me maybe we go
like watch movie or what but after that I come back home I take leave so that I can wash everyone's clothes at home lah gosok baju semua because ya
ya and then like it's not like dua tiga orang tau like in the house there's like ten plus people I'm like why
tak ingat seh I think like since COVID about
asal kau ketawa ah kau teringat something ah ni kan mesti
a'ah that time yang aku video call kau tu lah yang kau ingat tak what happen that time
tu ah
kerja aku rabak juga ah like because I don't know whether
um kerja aku recently buang orang like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left semua nak kena buat you know pick up the slack abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat
everything can be done via the laptop lah but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to apa tu collect dia punya physical mails
eh aku tak boleh imagine sia like I will I cannot even you know
both of us ada short attention span and like to have
abeh like you can't even like focus and
banyak orang juga like you know stress eat
I see I will check that out I think one day aku check it out
oh that's fun speaking of joget recently also like literal you know literally yesterday err me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through macam dance punya youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing kan kau you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to kau buat like um
HIIT workouts I mean that works better lah because you know it's a specific punya macam err they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then um she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to apa tu download
this thing err this game apa just dance eh ya so we've had we've yet to try that err it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
like you feel more refreshed abeh nanti kau tak feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time err always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
I'm not one to preach but it is important lah cause now also zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang all fast food and things like that you know as compared to zaman dulu kan they're more much more
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes pun jadi ah
highly ambitious niat tu ada but selalu tak kesampaian like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday macam berangan ah like macam kau nak oh berangan nak jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour ah
and then lepas tu start the start my day right you know working and then like macam feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said ah tadi you just have to be consistent ah
kena monitor ah
ya like macam if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you macam tak nampak so tired or worn out tau
aku memang suka like dark err like because I don't know like
entah eh macam tak lawa sangat ah
ya I hang it like macam fairy lights around dia punya ni ah my my bedroom punya frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it lah and then macam because I prefer to use like macam candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that kalau fairy lights when you switch it on kan
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings ah different modes that you can choose from like macam those like blinking ones or like macam alah you know macam lampu lap lip lah basically
ya I use it is dia macam aurora lights
no lah I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep lah bila aku nak you know feeling spa day nak relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
bila aku nyanyi ya bila aku nyanyi nak feeling feeling
a'ah eh berapa lama eh kita dah kawan
kat gek poh ah
two yes tapi K one
K one yang dekat err mmhmm uh huh
sama eh
tak ingat seh but I know it's
memang confirm primary school lah but I don't know whether it's like primary five mother tongue eh ke apa
oh apa eleven
tak tahu it's like literally after school it's not
ah eh speaking of which tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun like literally random ah like aku tak rapat dengan dia pun like tu pun aku that time kerja part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then err kita tak contact pun and then after that random after few years aku jumpa dia dekat err tioman island ke apa then random gila then lepas tu we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to bali and then I met her again just now so macam random lah like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to macam like meet them often but
oh ah tu pun random seh kau pun pergi trip dengan dia juga
anyway speaking of which how's your love life dah lama aku tak dengar apa any anything new that you want to talk to me about
the last time kau cakap dengan aku dia
something about his throat eh sakit ke apa
rajin seh kau
you know macam you gave so much um care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return lah kau ikhlas memang but
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like macam it's one sided like you
you know then bila kau sakit tangan ni semua I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so macam he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like macam all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
err it is all about compromising and macam if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
then entah eh do you really think it's worth it then
a lot of things like macam
aww dia blue tick kau oh dia seen kau oh my god
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes dia yang paling decent
if you may never know mana tahu
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know um but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so kau just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head kan bila kau like you know
late at night kau tak boleh tidur thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually ah you don't like macam don't don't make it obligatory for him
kau tanya jer
and then kau action ah treat him for his birthday or what
bila birthday dia
oh dekat tu
tak ah kau action macam oh my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
ya or um no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like err jual mahal but at the same time like hey you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
err do you have any plans macam a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like macam err let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to err do you have any plans macam like secretly hoping him would to say yes
kau set reminder set reminder

macam you know is in indo I think it's stands for
like like ah let's say people macam request for something
in indonesia they they want it in singapore so we can request from there ah macam service gitu ah
like macam anything ah from snacks ke err makanan ke or err baju-baju
ah sebab I think kan pasal pandemic pasal COVID then kita dah tak boleh pergi indonesia ke nak pergi negeri mana-mana
I like suddenly macam struck an idea like to go and
err apa
like we can we can use this service or people can use this service untuk err apa
um bring bring food or bring apa-apa lah like snacks ke apa to singapore lah like they can macam some
macam ada orang dia orang rindu makanan-makanan indo then dia orang macam uh teringin ah nak makan
actually it's just three months aje lah ya we are still in our macam trial trial run lah kita tengah tengok macam mana err dia punya demand and people's punya response semua macam mana
and dia orang kalau happy
willing to venture out more lah macam venture in
ya like I think this is now macam a good opportunity untuk kita buat
such a business sebab
sebab kita kan
dah tak boleh travel
business I think mainly macam communication ah dengan ah like liaise
language barrier ada sikit ah pasal dia orang kan berbual bahasa so ada certain things kita tak faham then kadang miscommunication juga macam kita nak cakap satu benda dia orang interpret as something else
then uh tu tu one of the difficulties lah
then lepas tu macam err
sebab kita kan tak boleh ada there
then lepas tu
macam err we we
ah ah ya ya ya sekarang susah eh
ah we go sekarang mm that's why
like some now nowadays you nak beli groceries you pun macam susah I mean like you kena err cut down cost lah
kan selalu kalau tak boleh pergi ke apa just to buy our necessities then sekarang dah susah ah sebab barang-barang kat supermarket semua mahal seh then
hopefully lah inshallah ada mm
err first thing eh actually mm mungkin I want to go morocco
a'ah morocco one of the place then lepas tu satu lagi dekat new zealand
new zealand ya uh those two are depends not really dah lama but I think is err one of the beautiful places kan
but I I've I never I've never been to like err macam mana eh like those kind of err moroccan kind of err you know country ya yang macam ada those kind of architecture ya
so it's quite interesting lah untuk tengok semua ya
I suka macam tengok permandangan mm macam gunung-gunung
err macam gitu lah
ya sebab err
it's very beautiful lah kan like ya I I I've actually new zealand I've been to I dah pergi norway
ya uh uh uh so macam is is such a beautiful place lah
ya so then like like I think new zealand is also one of the one of it also so macam
that's why nak experience it lah
mmhmm macam very ya macam very chill and then lepas tu santai-santai ah
actually kalau macam new zealand kalau kita sewa macam caravan kan
I I think boleh consider lah parents macam err elderly ke orang-orang
yang susah macam kurang upaya ah macam gitu ah dia orang macam err okay ah they can just macam duduk dalam caravan tu
lepas tu relax
relax sahaja
so macam
I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience untuk orang-orang macam dia orang ah kan macam actually my parents pun dah berumur juga
my parents pun bukannya pergi
jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun err indonesia
ah ah so indonesia punya view
indonesia punya view dia macam lain kan dengan new zealand new zealand macam ah then also dia punya climate pun
err lain ada sejuk sikit ya mm mm mm
mm correct macam I rasa
kita kan orang melayu kan so kita punya apa lidah or something eh our taste buds lah macam mesti kena ada pedas ah macam gitu or mesti ada
sambal ke apa ke err kalau macam bland ke macam let's say pergi western punya country macam makan pasta ke makan macam cream cream or cheese mm tak semua orang macam melayu suka kan macam ah sambal tumis lah ah apa
ya lah different perception macam orang pergi dengan parents mana pergi dengan
kawan pun macam mana kan ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's sebab sebab err
sebab apa kita macam err sometimes kalau okay lah like when we were young
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that lah but with friends ah you have to consider all of these things lah budgeting lah apa all that
like when that time I went to err europe ah then I experience the snow and all so it was err quite fun like you can have snowball fights semua ya then like you do all the silly silly things lah ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore kan
ya so but err how to say macam the aesthetic
uh I think jackets at least we can still save lah for our next few trips ke apa ya ya hopefully get to experience again
err oh ya okay dah pernah pergi lah ya I went before uh once ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like huh korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of macam
orang dia you know macam like the the people there are really polite
polite gila like they
mm you should try the apa
err I'm not really but depends lah on the circumstances macam if you ask me to go skydiving err part of me would want but part of me will be scared lah of course ya cause like I'm that that afraid
ya I think I I don't I cannot I cannot even bunuh that spider because
ya so eventually I think we just let it be we just macam like throw things at it and slowly the spider went out of the house
tak lah tak ada lah ya ya ya ya this one I think can say quite
not not so hairy lah the normal tipis but but it looks it's like the size of my palm lah around there
cockroach dah mati bare hands tak boleh lah cockroach is quite dirty
macam kan
dia punya kulit tu macam keras then like I don't know I cannot tak boleh imagine macam mana orang makan
orh maybe when lepas dia orang dah kukus then dia jadi
lembut sikit lah is it

takda I also got listen to you what
that's great sorry uh I didn't hear you just now you were saying uh you buat apa sekarang
oh eh ah ah eh like why why would you participate kalau you indonesian sorry
indonesian I see uh freelance tu kat mana
like how how do you find the freelance job macam mana
oh that's that's great because um actually macam kalau I pun tengah cari-cari kerja lah sebab um recently I just quit my job because of ya ya because of some um apa kesihatan ah related to kesihatan um ethics so macam I not quit lah I taking a break so but I tak tahu I nak continue ke tak
ya so I'm I'm looking for jobs to so macam that's interesting um maybe I can like to try to look uh look for this kind of jobs too
ah ah like I I feel like I woke up everyday like macam rasa tak happy gitu seh like nak pergi kerja alamak
hmm so like uh as of now I I tak tahu if like it's not my passion or like it's not it's not my rezeki or what because I really feel like uh I used to really passionate about this tapi macam sekarang macam dah malas nak pergi then macam really tak tahu lah if I should continue or not but like now I'm taking like maybe two months break
oh okay so what like sekarang like what line you you at like uh what industry
ya but I pun macam not really um into it yet macam how how do I say it macam dulu I
baru jer baru jer because
ya I baru graduate uh last year as in actually this year lah the apa tu during the period actually suppose to have our um ceremony kan tapi tak boleh ya so I'm the unlucky batch
ya um ya so um I I got into an internship dia ajar bukan ajar lah tapi macam it's speech and drama so I um my course actually applied drama and psychology uh so macam my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they macam post me to uh this early childhood not early childhood lah tapi macam like somewhat macam budak-budak dia macam actually interested uh tapi I got confuse I think I more interested in the uh in the drama side instead of teaching budak-budak
when I was in internship oh uh so pagi kita okay uh so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so pagi uh tak ada apa-apa it's just admin job then the admin job pun macam like tak susah sangat lah I mean like it was difficult because halfway kita punya supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in uh the company because of some things happen uh then uh so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang for class kan then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just uh tolong the teacher to just hype the class nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap something funny then we're just like uh apa tu oh my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing lah macam stupid gitu tapi macam
ya it's like to encourage them to macam speak up macam do do the drama with them macam we will have like um dramas uh drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
ya so like now I tak tahu if I nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
um actually it's not like allow allow not like dia orang suka-suka nak allow but it's like um it's a bit unethical for me to work there also lah because like err I've been having macam low moods and stuff so macam kesian the budak-budak lah
hmm I honestly tak tahu seh because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so macam I I tak tahu if it's because of my um my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm um but I I came clean to my boss like I bilang dia uh whatever that's been happening in my life then she say lah macam uh I don't think you're you're capable of working now so macam I need to macam set my head straight lah uh maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel macam hundred percent here lah because like right now you're a like everywhere
and that's a big decision to make seh because like um it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then macam in the future like kalau lambat then you it's hard for you to change but now macam is the time um for us to macam explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
ah tu lah
ya unless kalau kita kerja part time yang macam um temperature taking gitu semua I mean it's it's okay lah macam good ya it's better than nothing tapi macam the thing is ah I'm just worried macam this is just macam just graduate kan so macam I think too much about stuff then um if I take that kind of job now then macam I don't have like much experience in like uh what I want to do in the future dia macam I scared macam I'm not prepared lah but this is just me overthinking lah but um if dapat dapat kerja the temperature taking pun macam bersyukur seh as of now
berapa lama the the webinar
wow that's really good because like actually um when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to macam a diploma conversion ya so but then um for now obviously cannot uh go to the school lah the tapi nanti if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so macam um I I don't know I feel like macam its a bit more demanding in a way macam and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit macam focused on like just real school
oh no uh it's not uh teaching the kids at home but err apa itu it's just like normal school macam we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning baru kita teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two um one we teach the kids at school real kids then balik then err the teacher that lecturer will teach us pula on like about kid
um honestly I feel like a bit macam I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet kan macam I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class tapi um from what I think ah macam it depends on the company you work with kalau the company macam give you a lot of uh things to do like homework macam preparing worksheets for the kids tu semua they don't have like a proper system like tak ada macam mana eh they tak ada their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so macam it's that already a a lot of workload then kita pergi sekolah we have also we also have our assignment and like test tu semua ya so it's like it's a bit macam scary kan
ya I feel I felt that way lah then macam that's why I felt really macam um I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown semua
um I think they because there's only one that just uh finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said macam is going to be difficult lah sebab um the tempat kerja even weekend sometimes the boss I think macam she didn't like intentionally do this tapi macam just to macam she will like text us during the weekends macam to tell us need to do this this this so macam um my colleague yang just finish the diploma dia cakap ah it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then macam we we also have the our stuff to do so macam she she felt like it's a bit difficult lah to go through
that so macam she she was concerned about me lah because like she she knew that uh it's going to be tough for me and especially now kan um that's not enough teacher the card the company so so macam there's a lot of macam pressure on on the new teachers macam kita not teachers lah macam supposedly I'm not supposed to teach kan so macam they try their best not to macam expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper tapi macam sometimes nak tak nak macam takkan lah nak biarkan the company to drown kan like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya macam that's why macam she say it will be early will be more tough on me lah because everything is new then nak kena belajar nak kena adapt to the changes then like uh nak kena apa belajar lagi
but then like okay so why why macam I'm stressing myself kan like I agree with you macam since since secondary school I already told myself macam kalau tak happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then um but then now kan macam I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone lah tapi macam I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then macam I takut because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre tapi kat singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this nak buat theatre macam mana kan like there's no audience but I know there's some like macam virtual and stuff but then macam virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously err you it's easier for you to um
uh to stay there lah macam to continue from where you are tapi macam kalau you are not in the theatre company then macam susah nak dapat nak ada audition pun tak ada
early childhood um the thing is like for early childhood kan macam I tak ada um much experience other than my internship internship ya so err I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like um there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is err is err the company itself yang I am in right now is actually macam they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that um she tak ini ah tak expect us to stay very long she just uh provide a platform for a like a stepping stone gitu so macam she she encourages people to ya she macam looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing macam I know deep down that I am interested in theatre lah to I want to macam act again and stuff tapi macam I know in singapore tak boleh kan so much that's the pressure lah ya I want to do theatre tapi macam I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
uh for like kalau I nak buat early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then macam and early childhood is not bad the the pay kan especially in singapore because they need people but then like um and like if I don't continue for early childhood I macam I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit lah honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like macam average lah tapi jap eh my mum my mum is like texting me
that's that's sweet because like my mom dia macam passive aggressive tak tahu nak cakap macam mana it's like ya she macam I um because dari kecil we don't really macam um not very affectionate we are macam okay ya so macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia a bit awkward macam nak open up pun a bit awkward
then macam every time macam dari kecil I nangis about like oh my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so macam like she taught me to be tough lah macam like err emotions she put away emotions tu so macam sekarang I sedih I marah or like anything lah then I cannot like go to her to talk about things lah then macam I try my best walaupun dia macam push or try to avoid the emotion kan I will just like
try my best to explain to her lah macam what I'm feeling this way because this this this tapi then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I cakap face to face she will macam like um suddenly become very cold then macam don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things macam err err if you cannot do it then I cannot force you macam that kind of stuff you know so macam I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not macam put any pressure on me but macam that itself already made me err pressurize ya
huh err err I I have seniors but then macam I don't really talk to them macam I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there macam I don't want to stop ya
ya so macam I go for the safest uh option first which is the early childhood lah then macam but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it tapi macam kalau I nak go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then macam
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off lah I would I would say so macam if like I don't have any this is just me lah err if I don't have any macam um any education or like any specific job in mind I scared macam like not good enough you know this is kan
ya so um ya lah so macam uh as of now he keep on saying macam don't worry don't worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like um that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
mm mm ya so like sekarang I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing lah because um it was a hard decision for me to make to like uh stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company um not preparing any anything for them macam macam very abruptly lah the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague yang ah the one that just went through the conversion she macam very quite helpful lah she macam keep on saying oh it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat err ya we teaching the we we you macam assisting the same class
hmm hmm but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting um the the same level kan so macam I was err more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so macam uh craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare tu semua kan
then like um the the thing is they they have this thing in the company macam kalau craft teacher dengan language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that err idea so macam most of the time I was doing the craft then macam balik pun I buat craft weekends pun I buat craft so macam like it was really a lot of stress for me lah ya then err macam I macam I that point of time geram dengan dia lah macam uh dia keep on saying macam oh I'll do it I'll do it tapi end up tak buat so I macam pressured lah because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson kan macam the one
ya so macam it was really really irritating then sampai like um the colleagues uh ah my other colleagues we very small company lah so macam they they saw me struggling gitu macam everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then err I my contract pula my timing ends at one thirty ah but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty gitu tapi my my timing kan I'm always there until four until three so macam
no no that's that's the thing so the company macam we already say in the contract so macam it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so macam ya that sucks lah that's macam that's why I feel like macam kalau I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm rabak
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so um if you have a diploma already but then you want to to macam decided to go for early childhood industry kan so you can apply at an at and then err and will consider ah macam but most of the time they will they will accept you ah because macam tak banyak in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya tak I don't think is lah because like um it this is there's a stereotype of like err early childhood teachers gets a lot of because um there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that tak banyak in singapore nak buat
then um if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say lah the company wants to sponsor you then um they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so macam diploma tu semua macam uh your O level english tu semua and then err they will contact you lah eh but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and um october
uh I right now I don't know if I want to continue lah because like after talking to you then macam like really make me realize macam ya I should just macam do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
um that's that's good but then like um that's I used to have savings um before before joining the company kan and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop rosak so I decided to buy a new laptop lah so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then macam the laptop won't be so much lah and I also look for a cheap laptop not like macam one thousand plus gitu ah
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then um after I got the laptop so macam my savings to terjejas like affected already then then like err when I join the company then I got the pay already right then macam okay lah my first pay so macam I belanja my my family to eat tu semua then like my boyfriend leaving so macam I help him with um err not help him macam like I give him as a gift to semua macam barang-barang for but not everything lah within just a few then macam I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like um broke macam mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like um I I didn't expect things to happen then macam my savings pun now like terjejas my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then macam I really feel macam everything is just
it's just cubaan now lah
ya but like I like mention ah I tak tahu if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my err my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
um so but a bit too macam you know so that people don't just terminate contracts suka hati ya so but I I brought it up to her lah about my situation tu semua but she quite understanding she say macam the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality lah it's not really macam to force to force you to pay or what
so macam she just macam let err let me uh apa tu not pay it eh not pay her and just macam take a break first but like err she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her lah but then macam as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her lah because really make
err I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time macam I feel the guilt lah because I told her that I want to continue working but like um I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that lah honestly because like at that point of time I really you macam have a lot in mind so macam I tell her stuff that I macam regret now
I I don't know why I as of now I really macam feel like everything is err falling apart lah because um ya lah because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then um my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just tapi macam I had a past of like my err my father's death so macam it kind of like triggered me lah just macam ya that's what I'm thinking so like um he him leaving my changes trigger everything lah so err I'm feeling like really really macam at my lowest right now lah ya so macam I feel sekarang
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why macam I'm supposed to take a break during tapi macam my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working macam why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then macam I need to macam ya so macam I don't know I'm really lost right now lah so I'm trying my best to macam look for freelance work from home kind of thing
and segan kind also ya understood
okay is it is it the connection the the wifi but I think my wifi ada something wrong gitu cause macam I can but then macam like very dubbing
then ya lah I I I understand why what you mean by macam um you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is um I overthink a lot lah so macam when people macam just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think oh I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him macam I will start to to question myself lah macam like am I am I like menyusahkan or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like um I ya lah sombong or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone err especially like someone that I don't know so macam I don't really have macam anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then macam ya
ya I I think it will help definitely sikit ke banyak still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how macam you're doing it for your own good it's like you you boleh make that decision you know of like um taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I masih macam like in the past as they have this macam um want to like put uh put some into my savings so like now macam even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so macam oh but oh my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just macam nak lepaskan anger gitu because like I'm so annoyed because err so this month punya pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so macam every time this month it's just very unlucky for me lah I got food poisoning lah I got like macam selesema lah because there has been like cold uh cold bug around the school so err then I got it also then I also macam ada panic attack in one of the night because I ingat I injured my neck so macam this month I took a lot of thinking that macam you can like I can claim from their lah then rupanya they cut cut it off from my from my gaji then because like err I still macam baru kerja situ it's still not three months yet something like that lah so macam they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard macam from my I'm not I don't know lah I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so macam and that's why I thought macam um we I already macam can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day baru like I she mentioned ah about macam oh I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so macam uh
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so macam macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu kan
err ya lah doesn't tapi sekarang macam I just feel a lot of guilt err towards the company so macam I tak tahu if I want to bring it up or not ah because err then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then macam they cutting from my gaji kan so macam I already had in mind okay my gaji month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I uh apa tu when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they rupanya they will like macam will not get a refund if I apa tu err discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred gitu so macam my gaji dah kurang then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay kan obviously the company won't ask won't macam want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then macam aduh sedih gila seh
like like I said lah that's why macam I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life um because like money wise then macam like um my boyfriend left for rasa macam got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really lah what's the everything is just falling apart
I have kakak but then like she she move out already because she nikah
hmm two actually but um my I'm not close to my eldest one because uh she we lain mak
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like um that won't bring that I won't bring it back home macam buat kerja kat situ then balik tak buat apa-apa
macam kalau penat penat kat kerja jer
I mean other than like there's um part time like macam F&B gitu lah guess can can do that tapi macam I don't know I kind of I'm not um I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think macam I can uh I can stay in can do that kind of part time but macam if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
organization so they are actually under macam they are more they work more with community instead of err kan kalau like you are the patient kan ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee lah macam like you just macam go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then um macam they will tell you lah or you you might need macam counselling or what then macam they will refer you to them lah me err I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy ah I'm not so sure about that but then macam um because yesterday when they told me about the the err what I can do next then macam rate of like err what the next thing then we just counselling lah macam is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
err I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't macam mana eh don't really ah take you no cannot ya
last time I travelled was I think that time masa tu tengah winter tengah musim sejuk

dari dari dari cerita pasal korea dari cerita hantu dari cerita dah sudah malam jumaat okay
tak nak ah
oo actually that's damn long eh I can't imagine like penat eh confirm
ah ada tempat duduk tak
before COVID oh my god it was a mess eh berapa banyak orang inside the bus
macam macam mana nak cakap eh like
susah nak breathe right yeah that's why I don't like wearing the mask you know it's really so hard
like satu tahun that is so long you know
yeah itu pasal ah nak buat apa right it's so sad seh like the amount of opportunities that we missed this year
kita tak tahu seh whether next year you can go or not
same oh my god last time I always go to makan sushi and the paling best right is like when malam malam kita go driving then we go and eat Ramly burger
but his burgers sedap gila oh my god actually like the authentic malaysian experience and I love it but like now
kasihan seh like
habis sekarang sebab COVID then they cannot do all these businesses you know like how they used to do and it's like so sad
huh tak best seh
dress up as a pocong to scare them
actually that's quite kelakar sia like honestly can you imagine malam malam tengah drive
habis tiba tiba nampak pocong scary wei I also will turn around seh LOL
yeah honestly but when in singapore tak ada apa apa jadi punya
like it's like okay kalau keluar terus kena ah arrested
habis like dia orang semua like they have fun with it ah but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so penat
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress gila tahu honestly
it's like you would think that kalau belajar online lagi senang kan but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but luckily for me tak it's like
our exam dulu kat um like hall besar besar kan sekarang it's all just in class
then honestly to me like tak ada vibes ah like there's no
and like honestly susah gila nak focus because like
ah tak my exam is all written
next sem we're going to have macam coding classes but this sem so far tak ada ah most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
eh but I thought they extended tak eh
best apa honestly I hated like
so it's always I feel like macam I'm the only person yang cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
oh it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I tak rasa honestly
like for me like susah gila lah to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
oh typical like mak melayu right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama honestly I don't know
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like tulis notes and stuff
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation bukan lah banyak sangat but
oh I only makan there like once before then I got try macam their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken
but like their chicken is one the best but honestly I think a lot of people say that that's their best menu item right like the rendang
oh who did you makan ah malayan council with
oh man low key nak makan seh
like honestly but like you said mahal gila like I still remember the
memang normal lah cafes in singapore all the food mahal kan tapi like
yeah I always sesat at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always sesat
more often so now I think I won't get sesat as much hopefully
I've been thinking of all these nice food to makan but guess what I can't makan cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same susah gila nak cari kerja serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
that kind of thing so like obviously semua orang apply apa kan
then bila apply then dia orang tak get back then macam tak faham seh like
I don't even know if I want to kerja at this kind of places cause honestly stress gila
like nanti ramai gila customers habis nanti got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
like dia orang macam sengaja right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
then only when you contact them then they will be like oh you have to do this nak kena buat itu lah nak kena buat ini lah
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like apa satu
then like all ten never get back to me like serious tak faham seh
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now macam COVID nineteen
time you think like senang meh cari kerja
yeah like honestly the tunggu like untuk tunggu like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part lah honestly
then like fikir fikir about it right it's like
you say a week right then any time in between that week pun you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
will end in a few months tapi tak
hais all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can keluar but like barely pun
like I buy it for what I can't even like pakai to keluar and it's like so heart breaking
have this kind of spike and all then like when it terjadi macam terperanjat you know
we were like oh it's china's problem like kita semua ingat like oh china jer apa yang ada virus ni
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia tapi tak seh
like tiba tiba ada berapa banyak cases
sekarang [dah] like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly banyak gila and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
and honestly like dia serious tak guna ah honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like tak faham seh like
I understand wearing mask is susah lah but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also what right
yeah but if you think about it macam kasihan seh orang orang kat because like in the end
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like baru to them right
then maybe they will just dengar what he say because in the end he's president what he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so kasihan
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so merepek sia you think about it it's like
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday lepas tu habis kan
ah kejap eh
so he like macam like got my attention ah then like wah he not bad sia honestly
but tak apa ah maybe this kind guy will be the exception kan
tuk tuk and like nenek will have these kind of names
super super tinggi but like one seven five not bad right
like okay lah I'm not like super upset about it ah tapi um macam sakit hati ah like because like
he just double tick me sedih tahu
I only made the account semalam so it's like what
banyak gila like malay guys who like match with me
daughters as in macam anak anak perempuan
it's like very personalized so macam you tahu macam he don't use it on other girls
I don't know the guy so far okay lah I think everyone macam
extra bosan now cause of like COVID nineteen
intense apa
like tak pernah dengar seh a dating app like this like OkCupid is so chill what it's like
habis lepas tu start talking but like Bumble is so intense what the heck
you got try before right the K Fry chicken sedap tak
ah seh honestly kita selalu pergi malaysia because like the prices are cheaper right especially with the
it's sedap gila like I don't even like dim sum
yeah like dulu kita kan selalu pergi malaysia like my family will go to like
makan like we are always eating you know
like you said there's not much to do in so it's always like makan makan makan
like kita
in one day I think we will makan at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like konon konon macam food tester ah try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best gila seh that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not halal in singapore is halal in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like kena makan pepper lunch
I think it's like I saw your story then you saw my story kita dua kat kan then you like ask me where I going then like you said oh I going there also then I remember it was so funny
habis like tengok bawah
eh is that anna habis my whole family macam
siapa ah dia boleh like terserempak in cause we are singaporeans right
best apa imagine being able to go to an Apple store and like just woo spend all your money on the stuff honestly good life
I rindu seh like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to makan nasi biryani
but yeah basically macam
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat nasi biryani then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic nasi biryani cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on nasi briyani and all tapi tak
our weddings will always have like the nicest nasi biryani and honestly I just miss all that
he always does macam poll on Instagram and then got one time he tanya which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote nasi biryani I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have nasi briyani like
when I think of wedding I think of nasi biryani right
yeah and another thing that I feel like kena ada is sambal goreng pengantin right
mm macam macam pelik also pe like hari raya is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally pe like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during puasa so tak payah makan
but like how pelik is that like puasa is like meant for
puasa you know macam
mana orang nak pergi wedding mana orang nak pergi celebrate semua macam merepek kan honestly
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it sekarang COVID
err wedding kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang jer kan
you know like honestly you know how malay families macam selalu kena ada wedding besar besar kan honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding yang besar besar because
okay you think about it you eh you're the pengantin right then like penat gila seh you must tukar outfit berapa banyak kali throughout the day
habis you kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum the whole day I don't want
macam my wedding to be full people yang my mum tahu you know cause it's my wedding pe shouldn't it be people yang I tahu not my mum
yeah I think yang paling penting is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride yang cantik yang berseri you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing lah need to see whether my husband in the future kaya tak kidding
you know macam like err ada movie this one movie I forgot what the title is ah tapi macam
dia orang best friends dari kecil then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
habis like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie ah tapi the movie best gila
since dulu I've always wanted to do like a
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal macam lagi best ah to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so bosan now
yeah like in singapore macam susah gila nak like get all these things ah honestly cause
susah eh nak dapat all of it yeah so it's like
yeah I also think about it like err my dream die do right is to belajar in Australia
but actually like if you fikir about it lah actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain bila like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also pun nak migrate but then if you think macam sayang right cause everyone is here then nanti raya macam mana raya will be
but I can't imagine now like sekarang jer [dah] susah for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
like you know dulu all my family members call me celup because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school semua orang terperanjat macam huh
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like berterabur
yeah actually it's true ah macam
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind yang want to totally forget about our language
like dulu like in malay class my cikgu always say like you want melayu to become obsolete is it
how all of you tak tahu cakap melayu semua then like I think about it like true seh like
how can a language just disappear macam sedih kan like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so I will try my best to improve my malay sekarang I don't know
yeah honestly faham ah like hari raya is very like
by the way foodpanda helmet masih ada tak
ingatkan nak pergi ambil besok ramai orang masa tu uh queue untuk ambil helmet
takpe lah by the way ada kerja kosong tak
okay nanti bila hari isnin ke apa bilang ayah lah
macam abang azri pun boleh if not depends ah uh similar to my intern kot
oh by the way then our family this month ada apa-apa plan tak
oh dia orang pun join juga ah
alesya punya birthday oh
oh habis ayah tak pergi
takpe lah kalau tak pakai untuk hotel boleh book apa lagi
okay lah kalau gitu you enjoy your staycation with ibu nanti boleh makan kat cafe kat masjid sultan sana
oh how many season mampus okay no thanks
air fryer buat apa nak air fryer kita takde ke
okay lah tu murah kot ada warranty kan air fryer lagi
oh tengok oh tengok ah macam mana kalau masih ada sale tapi ibu tak nak beli apa-apa
oh habis tadi siang tak cerita dengan ibu
series main macam filem
kenapa suami nicole yang jadi suspect
serious kecohnya bodoh apa
habis kalau gitu netflix ada tak
lol leceh habis besok keluar dalam tak
tak habis-habis sia habis kalau gitu tadi balik tak nampak pun motor scrambler mana motor scrambler tu
dia hantar sevice apa
habis kenapa tak suruh full service jer
uh untuk motor tu
ha gitu jer lah dia tapi tu motor untuk abang ayie eh
ah biar lah asal dia orang dua bahagia lah
a'ah uh engineering informatics yes betul
dia punya is more on
uh engineer punya side more on not say maintenance dia punya more on testings
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one uh ya yang test setakat masuk setakat duduk from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad lah the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like abang azhar on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well ah he he works at dia kerja kat jurong uh water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level uh when it rises when it lowers err which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview uh every uh mostly entire of singapore like know the longkang and stuff like that
okay lah not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause dia masih dia orang sponsor dia orang sponsor dia sambung belajar
a'ah dia tengah ambil part time diploma
ya dia tengah ambil kat uh singapore poly because near to his workplace ya bayar sampai bayar sampai habis uh second year ke atau I forget I never got
but tengok lah macam mana
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know uh you know they ride by they saman people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle ah like one my friend she intan at uh hers is under
dia bantai jer gaji dia besar
I mean kalau pun not bad uh dia sampai what two let's say you habis two forty five you extend what pukul lima pukul enam then after that
ya I think so oh ya ya yang tadi kita berbual-bual
ya ke ingat oh
five to seven lima ke lima tujuh ribu depends
huh murahnya
tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang uh
huh sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang clutch housing kadang-kadang bearing kat dalam engine kadang-kadang piston banyak benda yang akan effect your bike
ya lah me lah I mean ha kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya ya tapi the reason I want to use is ayie's not say lumba your bike considered
untuk budak-budak err bawa motor nakal tapi you bawak terus jadi motor apek
okay lah kalau gitu how about kita share
apa X one apa uh oh oh class two A ke class two B oh two hundred oh
tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat carpark
okay lah cuma at the same time nak kata nak kata sayang tapi
tak boring ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh
kesedapan at the same time untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa motor boleh jam boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu
got a bit lepak ah in a way so he thought want to earn more money
no he he he was dead serious dia betul-betul uh dig through everything asking me macam
uh all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab apa dia punya benefit apa dia punya you know uh
apa uh akan jadi kalau gini gini semua so I ceritakan dia lah I was uh apa tu
I bilang dia macam
okay kalau foodpanda leceh dia kita kena book shift kalau deliveroo dengan grab uh anytime kita boleh start boleh offline
uh antara ni tiga company tak semestinya uh masing-masing ada uh dia punya
benefit dia tapi at the same time ya lah he tak boleh cerewet lah kita kena banyak sabar because
I pernah tunggu one hour for just one makanan so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
dia macam dia macam okay jer macam
boleh jer tapi at the same time tak tahu lah pasal motor tu kan pun under ayah
pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula so okay lah pros and cons ah siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi understand lah maybe back then his workload was too much in a way lah pasal dia kata uh
ada budak baru masuk this and that so macam workload dia macam kurang tapi macam spread uh evenly ah so untuk dia
uh advantage ah pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya shift lagi dia ada pagi atau petang so that time dia pernah tanya lah macam
uh dia ada bilang dia punya uh cadangan dia kalau dia buat
kalau dia kena pagi punya shift lepas habis pagi dia dia uh ha dia buat delivery dia dia kayuh daripada
uh lepas maghrib ah sampai malam
tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak lah dah cakap dah uh dia cakap senang ah pakai bag kau abang tak payah beli so you know lah your brother macam mana eh
huh ya lah dia dia berbual kat orang jer ah cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak lah
ya tapi tak tahu lah I mean dia sendiri that time nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli padahal dulu dia ada yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak problem this and that so I don't get his point ah
pasal tak tahu lah dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar oh ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka you know tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham ah dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia
dia tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik motor bagi kat ayah so dia beli motor sendiri after dah berapa tahun ya dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu lah dia
uh huh dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul
tak pasti ah tu kena tanya ayah mmhmm mungkin kot
then oh then that time apa abang ada tanya
uh he he dia tanya akak kerja grabfood macam mana mmhmm then I said lah macam gitu lah dia I uh I say lah the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then dia terus bingit ah dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang lah kau panas baran macam gini macam mana
tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki how
tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena viral jer
ya ada yang that time punggol budak-budak grab gaduh dengan vendor pasal tak tahu sabar I think it was some promotion lah then I think
ya jangan jadi viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
oh oh ya my friend my friend kerja roo uh this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot lah even though
I mean kita dah layan hujan habis
bayar sikit jer you know so for roo to do that I'm very amazed lah
oh tak distance dia memang dia dia add on tapi ni dia tambah lagi because dia orang perasan somehow I think orang complain pasal hujan then you know safety and stuff so at least
worth it and you know macam berbaloi ah
ya for roo macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas so if compared to grab I have to take three orders tapi three orders pun tak semestinya I can get within less than one hour

actually I don't get it is it taxes or what cause I heard is some hijrah fund or something I don't get it lah the
cause I watch one video they say it's actually like um people chipping in to go to mekah something like that some
some tabungan ah ya that's why that's why I was like wah you scam and most of it is older people that one like atuk-atuk nenek-nenek they like dying but want to go to mekah that type so they chip in to the tabung ah then I'm like bastard sia

a'ah eh no no no salah salah that was lockdown
cause even if the vaccine come already the job market is still rabak though means maybe when we twenty three baru we find a proper stable job or like twenty two
then some more they say the airline industry will only recover in twenty twenty four so we can only travel properly by twenty four years old I want to cry lah sial lama seh by that time I'm like almost thirty eh
a'ah seh oh ya my boyfriend say even if the border open right now quite risky to go also cause the people there confirm like macam the jobs very low then people there are like desperate so must be careful of your belongings cause they might rob you
sama lah
then aku macam sial lah dia ni bodoh sial bodoh sial
hais itu lah
kedekut eh a'ah calculative sial
itu lah
dah lah kedekut bodoh pulak itu alamak
yay okay um oh my god can you imagine I cakap yay pula nanti dia kena transcribe lagi takpe takpe okay
oh how come ah how come boleh
but still two and a half months pass by quite cepat actually kan
oh cause macam
bila you start the project dah start is it the project that they were doing at the place
oh eh the area dekat dekat mana though
what was I going to ask oh but then macam was it susah to like
you know you you took on like new cases atau existing cases that they pass on to you gitu macam tak hard to adjust
macam short staff short staff sikit lah gitu
oh I think I remember your office dekat mana dia tempat uh my office dulu kan daerah situ
uh apa apa itu nak cakap mm
oh tapi padahal they
ya so macam your experience is good lah from the oh
and then macam environment besides environment wise macam your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all macam okay lah like okay like no issues
pasal dia dah biasa with what macam
tidak apa lah kita apa itu take turns
are there ada interns lain or you just seorang intern like or like got other people macam doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually macam fresh grads or
all macam budak masters or like budak degree macam you know same level as you
oh so it's not macam it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
ketawa but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year atau
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of macam
macam organisations lah
you know ada this issue
apa itu offer so called
it's okay keep your options open then macam explore um you know macam lain opportunities when do they need to hear by
uh okay tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam deadline for the application
ya faham faham totally faham
cause tadi bila I ketawa kan dia punya line macam besar
apa nak cakap mm
oh okay ya I totally understand macam the need to take a break I mean
studying kan lagi berapa lama before you finish the when you finish your masters
tak necessary is it
mm ah ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking macam you know I really don't mind
so macam who knows maybe if I if a a different place macam even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree lah gitu
okay is macam zoom is surprisingly so much harder than tak zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like macam you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot macam how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like um when I
and then macam the way you talk to them actually on zoom kan you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so macam the tone macam they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then macam I get a bit sub ah subconscious a bit conscious bila I punya camera on so macam when my camera itu on so I boleh nampak my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very macam self-conscious gitu lah
so tapi bila I off um I am less self-conscious I can be less
err I can be more strict gitu tapi I tend to not because kita have to senyum for the entire lesson senyum for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so macam
kalau macam camera off then I will terlupa to senyum gitu lah ya so a lot of things to take note macam
tapi dia orang macam type nonsense tau macam hi hi hi hi macam
kalau answer dia A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like ugh but then okay lah they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think tapi ah last week I did not teach because um oh so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then bila I balik
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I tak warm up lah it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just angkat berat then I felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then I was like oh no
so I thought I thought macam okay okay is it because I'm sore asal asal macam susah ini I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
be sakit lah then macam I really messed up like aiya something is wrong lah this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back tapi I continue whatever I can but lepas I balik I had a class lah and then during the class I told them I will be lambat sikit because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour macam this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so macam so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually kita will jumpa about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in lah so it's still okay
and then macam um I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my um how to say my not my supervisor lah she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday tak payah so macam you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
jadi on saturday she told me uh tak payah kerja because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
tapi I tak pergi cause my back sakit so I was like okay lah okay lah
ya tapi
ya then after that I thought okay just rest lah macam take this opportunity to rest so I rest tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik and then macam it hurts when I sneeze so I thought alamak ini macam not macam bukan tak normal kan ya
ya so I told my coach semalam yang it hurts when I sneeze so she said mm she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like oh maybe you should go sebab kalau pergi the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like tak nak so she was like okay lah then macam tengok chiro or like uh get a sports massage lah so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like bekam
and sports massage cause I read like bekam can help with like nerve macam you know what if your nerve macam err nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you macam you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so macam it's apparently bekam can help with that and macam
ya bekam can help you with that I takut sakit tak have you tried it before
oh did she say if tak sakit eh
mm you free kan dekat gambas that's where my other gym is
uh dekat sembawang there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that um has is qualified to do like the massage and the bekam is dekat will be at the gambas one on monday
err she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she belum reply I so I tak tahu belum confirm ah tapi
itu pasal she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so macam
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then macam what she will do depends on your condition so macam either I mean you can ask for her to bekam lah if you that's what you want macam mana otherwise she will uh base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a bekam or like some mobility work ah
mm tapi I think she buat bekam angin if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing bekam on instagram can send you
no it looks like the angin one like ada macam after she put the cup like she pull something mm then the thing macam suction
go for the darah one
oh so the dia macam slightly different how to say
err like bekam angin versus bekam darah macam target slightly different things lah gitu
oh the dekat rumah dia is it
oh I ada macam hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
um like consultation dia sahaja dah
macam hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
uh tapi ya she she's a private doctor lah so very mahal like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation sahaja hundred plus then macam if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage atau bekam dulu lah I mean kalau it's not like
no ah abeh sekarang sekarang my kaki sakit dah lah belakang sakit kaki sakit because I pergi gym
for training yesterday kan then uh certain things aqilah lah like macam you know she
uh macam certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know macam I feel like my ego I have like macam like it's frustrating lah
like all the progress I've made gone so macam the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because macam nak angkat sahaja sakit then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared lah so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya and then tapi semalam ada sekarang my kaki sakit because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so macam like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so macam
oh really ah tuesday I still have like um today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more sakit then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after bekam there's no like rule to not do any physical activity kan I mean kita jalan sahaja
so kalau kita I mean kita hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
oh my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti all the haha hehes that kena transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also lah can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
oh anyway apa itu so
have you seen the list uh list pula have you seen the website yang I hantar
I don't know eh macam the jinx tak lah
I mean mana-mana pun ada so it's me lah
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say dekat situ ada banyak trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
your areas ada ke other trails macritchie is it wait no sembawang area
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it apa nak cakap eh okay we can look at more sites lah think got more options tapi yang yang at the the one I sent you to mm kita ada the lower pierce reservoir park
and then there's the sungei buloh wetland reserve need ini dekat mana eh kranji hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
oh this one got stairs don't want malas they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
oh tapi is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time ingat tak yang kita pergi makan
yang kita makan mukshidonna oh ya so she was talking about that
not officially tapi like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice lah he just seems macam very shy a bit macam shy lah I mean like a group of girls then kita kan kecoh so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
ya and very macam considering he's quite young he's very macam independentish macam financially independent like ya like matured lah matured
because err I assume her house I mean her house is big kan so I think and her room is big so I think macam he moved in with her lah
and padahal and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay lah I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing tudung
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because macam how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes lah like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then macam if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean tapi macam less of an issue kalau if the guy moves into the house cause he
uh ya that's true I feel like macam there's that expectation lah double standards a bit ya
not working ya because like oh perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
especially macam your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so macam if you come back after a few years then you're like uh you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care kan then it it might fall to the parents that's not fair so macam if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where macam dah besar sikit then at least school age school going age you know
siapa lah
where there's me then baru ada
hmm dah macam dah macam project
hmm tak suka
I suka especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
tourist stuff dekat Sentosa
wait but you dah beli belum dia punya ticket
cari online ah I think ada yang ada twenty five per cent off eh
it's not so much the beach lah because you all are going to macam tempat tempat the attraction right
that's at Marina Bay punya tempat
you know the one yang kita pergi Marina Barrage itu hari oh because you took Jihan punya car um
before you sampai Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
ada air-con tak
alah are you going malam or pagi
oh ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau
yang your own is
oh tak de tentage ah
sebab kalau nak tentage you can take mine
orh ya lah I mean is at one corner lah if that's what you want kalau you nak orang tak kacau then okay lah
ours was quite open dia exposed ah so
uh given the circumstances I think that's not bad lah but I think I saw some of them duduk dekat nearer to the lift area that one tak kena panas sangat
but pernah tak
ya kalau tak pernah then better don't
Seah Im kat luar lah park kat luar
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him jangan bawa motosikal because if he doesn't bring his bike then dia rasa macam
asal eh normally we ya
but muka girlfriend dia muka poker face tak is it she can ah
following each other's plan can but kalau the partner like me like that last minute say don't want ah I want today I got I got cramp ah I decide not to go to Sentosa then habis
because marina barrage dia punya jauh tau
because because Sentosa tak ada kereta senang that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
I seriously think that's a good idea too because Sentosa nak keluar pun leceh
cable car then yang Carlsberg tu
yang pusing pusing the thing that pusing
then apa sia yang lima
I went I don't think I've been to the one yang dekat Singapore
Hong Kong I went to Bangkok tak salah eh with my husband once
but ya you share with me ah I also want to see eh since my staycation dah kena cancel kan so
ya then you make him jalan also
but I'm pretty sure dia penat from going for kelas mengaji okay that's wrong but
dia kat mana dia dekat  bukan Tampines
because kalau daripada Tampines actually it's a bit more difficult lah dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang kan
I see oh it's not like she go and jumpa him somewhere and then they
yeah ni macam papa lah
oh last entry dia bukan tutup last entry
bukan tutup so that means uh last
last entrance normally tutup one hour later ah
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because susah you really have to macam tak de
tak ada secrets out
berapa orang sia
for eleven that's mahal leh
um nasi goreng tom yum
you have to see you know whether you have to make oh but because it's a hawker centre tak yah buat reservation ah
habis lah
I think kalau
potluck ah macam picnic style ah
ya if satay by the bay let's say penuh nak mams kan then you find in that area apa lagi kedai makan [ah]
cuma now we are not at Sentosa if you at Sentosa then ada banyak options ah
dekat Vivo banyak apa makanan
no oh my god dorang ni
nasib Zaki beli berapa banyak water bottle dia beli I think about
enam tujuh ada mineral water
because now the weather like sekejap panas sekejap sejuk
sekejap panas then the next thing hujan
oh dia kulit tebal lah
korang tiga orang aje eh
no si
Shad sama sama group kan
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dia macam one committee and then within the committee ada macam sub sub group ah
I can so dengan dia
ya ya ya ya ya ya I can see the long hair guy right dia punya muka macam

that time ah I see my friend pergi

rezeki don't tolak
rezeki dah ketuk kat pintu knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
orh dia tak kaku dia tak awkward lah
wait dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah
lurus bendul lah that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
not lurus bendul I think dia tak nonsense ah
uh lurus
and that's the reason why dia kena avoid orang orang yang macam hypocrite
a bit meh panas baran
no no this this is what that darah muda
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know dah besar anak mak
once dia masuk primary school ah
you bloom into a minah or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
yeah I took a nerd path come on then balik lambat

bila sia the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school

I think second last day ya then we walk okay ah kena buat detention first time in my life ah kena detention know then I was like
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health lah kesian budak ni ah bila bila bila
ha nampak
topic ni berat eh topic ni is very this topic is orang kata very wide dia punya spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance tapi beauty in terms of everything not just
uh look wise tapi beauty in uh nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is memang kita boleh counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
uh time kita berbual
so okay kita start gini lah eh kita start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay kau kau start dulu apa kau punya definition of beauty pada kau
oh that would tu bagus tu yes that that is bagus err bagus bagus
I don't see myself as kau tahu kan macam victoria's secret punya type punya ke lawa memang tak lah memang not even near that lah but because I I have my insecurities um based on appearance juga which itu pun is another topic eh kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu about me about
which people in our society is blinded by that sebab
standard kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
tapi for me beauty kalau kau lawa pun mana pun but if your if your attitude is macam gitu then
then memang you know what I mean
memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective ramai orang ada different punya perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just uh it's between the both of us what is our definition
oh okay for me my kawan the friends that I go like the friends that I cari atau dapat it's okay we we can talk about poly ya kita punya poly days is kita tak I I don't see like oh kau lawa I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never sebab
kau lawa I was going to say you no no no no I never sebab
I mean I don't know for me memang I don't see
go towards that sebab it's not gonna be a genuine punya relationship you know
sebab it's just gonna be
for clout macam you know you know some people uh there there is some uh cliques ke apa whatever in school yang macam okay sebab kau lawa kau popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame dia ada attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is memang maybe not because during after kalau your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person yang macam will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
macam for me and you eh macam this is kita pun semalam baru jumpa eh we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like kita punya relationship first first kita start from sec one
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and err err our friends yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward tau and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever inshaallah
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
kita punya personality because okay imagine kalau the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine kita takde macam makan orang makan orang you know what I mean like like betray or
tak payah cari beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any betul tak tu
like fashion wise you know is it oh damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
uh handsome uh lelaki kat dalam my course yang baik yang humble yang tahu yang dia orang tak stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also um
uh girls that they they dia orang punya dia orang macam you know they have that that beauty standard lah dia orang ada that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are sombong they are arrogant you know
so so macam it's a
I don't know err macam for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say kalau kau lawa you should then uh take advantage of it like you know you should your personality pun kena bagus
sebab but but people people who are lawa usually you know you know dia orang dia orang I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna ada that ego you know that ego that that it depends lah how you are brought up you know
not just that lah beauty in terms of you know right uh now we are all going to that stage of working kan it's always kalau it's always macam you see this um
not just competition but macam okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that macam sebab this person is sexy ke apa ada landed job
I mean that is for us yang mungkin macam of a lower standard
betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur eh I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
tapi uh beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that uh
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari um
is beauty important macam appearance wise or the best is macam mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
ya tu memang tu memang tu memang
ada yang suka cute cute ada yang suka macam E-boy E-boy
uh no err not not not the first uh judgement because because first judgement memang is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but uh overall macam to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
okay kau okay kau kau share kau share dulu cause ni pun uh is an interesting fact
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty sebab okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing macam okay lah first judgement yes appearance tapi kan people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or macam
uh macam the the act of uh sharing macam
uh caring the your you punya personality that is beautiful so
macam I think beauty eh is is
is again subjective sebab
ada orang eh they say macam asalkan kau kemas kan macam kau err you are clean you clean yourself macam it macam bukanlah you I'm asking you macam pergi plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
but but overall macam the of how you take care of yourself macam for the macam kita how we how we like its like macam you know like we we kita basuh muka something like that you know
the sense of beauty sebab okay macam beauty eh is again macam very it can be very um
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know uh I I got this macam macam experience kalau we we talk with our friends ke apa we always like ada juga topic topic yang macam ini maknanya macam anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of uh people
uh again it's it's about um macam low self esteem you know kau ada face gitu tak aku ada I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that macam to me I find that
macam kau do do you have any like um
insecurities ataupun macam low self esteem towards this kind of uh topic
I pun sama
sama sama sama sama for me sama err like I think
susah eh macam
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
terdetik lah kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang very kita rasa macam eh alamak you know what I mean
I I came across this one uh uh apa tu uh it's a meme lah the it's a kid the kid says macam the kid was saying uh dia like macam to god tau god uh
okay but I think betul lah macam
for me pun times yang I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful lah you know which is a wrong mindset sebab that means eh
if I'm uh pretty I will get somewhere I would get uh at least a modelling job ke apa you know at least I have something tapi
tapi okay siapa tak nak lawa kan siapa tak nak handsome buat apa dalam dunia ni
um tadi nak tanya tanya seribu question boleh
I think kan for me okay kita kita perempuan kan but I I think um generally generally speaking kan I think it's the girls is it but not me lah
subjective subjective but but I think kan it's more towards the girls sebab kan kau tahu lah macam we have like boys and girls is different what kita punya how we hangout how we
pergi towards that that
that apa tu tujuan like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
to you apa to you which one for you
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also lah you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which macam for for girls maybe some of them will talk about eh look at that I mean eh macam eh have you heard this about I heard about macam some of my friends uh classmate dia macam eh kau tengok tu eh kau tengok dia ni eh kau tengok you know they we they are always macam
that's kind of the topic yang
for you know me and you kita tak kita we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
kaum wanita lah it's always kaum wanita
tapi ya ya but uh uh um to mention macam orang yang tak lawa
tak but it's kini it's how society pandang you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know sebab this is how society looks sebab to be honest who started this thing called macam
uh okay uh kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this uh or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing mesti ada dulu maybe in history ada jer yang macam
okay kalau you macam ni I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with um you can say ni lumrah manusia tau you know kau tahu benda ni macam this human standard the world doesn't do this tau it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually kalau kalau we all treat people the equally uh got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having uh insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem sebab it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
macam okay I'm not gonna I'm not sebab you get it's subjective it depends some ada some parts of the world takde macam gini but some parts some of the world
that is very macam sebab it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning what that's why ramai orang macam ada yang every article is that people suicide you know
tak payah cakap pasal you macam gini kan it it can be because maybe sebab uh you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you what betul what macam
dia orang tak kacau kau apa or like they judge you base on your uh clothing ke based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can uh about also about also macam status
hierarchy system macam kaya and poor
is is tak berapa bagus
not just beauty tau macam pasal poor and rich pun boleh jadi problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen uh kau tahu kan macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak kan macam budak budak ada yang kena outcast kan you know what I mean
that macam uh the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that uh after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit macam betul lah like
takkan semua sama right pekerja then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work what because
true true true so memang ini
lumrah lah eh memang memang it's the world lah it's just it evolve like this lah to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be uh plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay uh dunia hiburan
about okay uh western world atau K pop eh macam for example that kind of thing
usually yang lawa jer pun yang disanjung disanjung disanjung
eh actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean punya
the K pop world you know what I mean sebab in western world we don't look at beauty what we we we judge based on uh music wise kalau kita suka kita suka macam for example like
uh there are uh idols macam mana eh
macam okay uh like
tak I think macam it's different kita tak boleh compare we cannot compare like western punya industry like the hollywood and and also K pop sebab K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol atau the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
yang lain semua you know especially when you're in a group of uh like of kau pernah kau pernah uh come across this article tak dia macam there's this one idol dia punya member tak berapa lawa tau macam
to me it's fine lah but it's ada sikit macam different daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa then all the all the macam the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is tak tak not of a pretty tapi is in the middle
so I think that is also rabak lah to be honest
ah memilih kasih padahal sama group tau padahal they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead lah like like why sanjung uh idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada jer yang news turns out that oh this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesn't uh
yes you said it betul apa
macam you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish tapi okay but see this is how beauty
beauty eh macam
uh sexiness ke based on their face ke or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards uh bad punya
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as uh the macam those those fans yang sanjung sangat kan it's not uh it's not it's not a good habit for them what sebab
sebab right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like macam harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
macam kau tak payah ada beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
tengok jer macam um oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the lawa the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that uh hosting punya and she can be successful you know what I mean
yang benda uh success
it also goes with macam top uh fashion wise you know what I mean
macam kau tahu kan dulu uh okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like uh sloppy
macam T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then kita pergi kedai mamak something like that right
kedai uh kopitiam or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think macam they they will look at us like eh dia ni biar betul you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where kita kita I'm gonna feel macam
tapi get it it's it's how era goes you know sebab zaman dulu imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right dulu time maybe like early two thousand
a dress with heels to a kopitiam people will look at you macam eh you biar betul
lain macam but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
uh think macam oh kau lawa macam it's fine
so see how this uh the the era macam how uh move eh you know what I mean
lain eh which is weird eh macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir wah
as technology becomes more macam
orang kata apa lagi gempak then
jap eh
tak tahu no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in macam those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters dia orang nak step jer macam they just follow the trend you know what I mean
I think there is like macam photos trend I guess kita kita use simpler uh simpler terms eh
as you know macam around starting to see because here I feel it
you know what I mean sekarang uh is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is uh macam instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
uh this kind of thing uh macam pinterest uh
dulu tumblr okay tiktok sekarang tiktok kan
sekarang tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's punya life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols ke your punya favourite punya artist uh kim K ke whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so maknanya
due to that that's why uh people are like following macam okay macam E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl tapi you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
tapi to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing err you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like suka dia punya style macam some people you can we see oh I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means tapi you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya macam that is that is not the right way sebab macam kau kena genuine with yourself lah macam
imagine you are not like that right tapi sebab kau nampak uh your maybe your cliques are all macam
uh going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you uh if you just change your clothing then it's fine tapi you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing kalau if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good uh circle of friends that is a good company tapi if you start to macam okay maaf cakap eh this can be very sensitive sebab imagine if your circle of friends uh macam smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right tapi you buat
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't uh people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right macam you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in macam
with people macam mana eh I I say you don't need to get okay macam mana kau nak get this thing
so macam you know like um you know they say there's a saying macam uh everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like macam macam mana eh like
err macam the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset tapi you you don't
but because everyone's macam kau
needs a level up you know what I mean macam level of for the good
tak bagus lah tapi macam like see this is how uh trend setting macam
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it tapi if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later tapi if you follow that kind of group yang buat benda tak elok then uh then you should
you should have your own pride eh macam you know what I mean kau punya pride kau tak payah follow orang lain punya orang lain punya instruction ada betul
boleh boleh boleh shoot jer shoot
pandang rendah is it pandang rendah you look down on them oh
where you stand macam mana you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead tapi kalau you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's sebab you nak ada you nak ada friends you know what I mean like quotation macam you nak ada friends punya pasal then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good uh there is not a good tujuan sebab kalau kau really nak
I mean you know some people macam for me no eh macam for me I got this thing where
kalau aku takde kawan then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
kita nampak I've I've I've seen this
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they dia keluar from the group kan dia keluar from the clique and then dia cari orang lain immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much macam you like like tak bagus lah I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own uh pendirian daripada
I I think uh I need to find I need to find a friend because uh because people might think nanti macam I got problem
same goes like your question tadi whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so sebab if the loner if that loner sometimes loner tu feels that
there's nothing wrong uh he he or she is of a good uh direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I kita support aku support tapi kalau
sebab you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on oh kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish lah I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know macam they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
sebab if you want to go for me eh aku aku I like to keep my circle of friends close macam just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know sebab to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial macam mana eh
you know kawan kosong and kawan that is really true
ya so back to your question where kalau the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you it's hard it's hard to say macam for me you know I just say but if I were to
tapi what I I can advice macam
tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
macam you you know kita aku case macam the clown eh macam the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the kita ni ni macam podcast eh tapi macam okay for those who tak tahu
aku I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert macam I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met mahirah kan macam okay dia macam pendiam tau but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
tapi uh mahirah aku
ya it take a long time not years lah tapi but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no aku respect kau sebab okay you you call yourself introvert right
but you are successful kau
for those who tak tahu
kau chairperson seh kau your leadership skill is really aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik err sebab your leadership is the best
and those who don't know don't know tapi once you find good people right you you stick to them macam for me thank you for being
my friends chey macam sedih pulak jiwang kenapa pulak sebab sebab it's true it's true
ya around sec two is where we kita more like kita dah kenal sec one but sec two is the year where
kita macam eh dia ni dah gila dia ni dah gila
kita punya gila-gila dah start kita punya gila-gila kita punya hantu hantu setan dah start eh dah start eh ya that's that's tapi wow those are the great days no those were the days where kita don't give a shit about appearance wise you know what I mean
kita kalau like eh how beauty what ever no kita macam kalau kau baik kau
kawan macam kau boleh gang dengan kita go ahead like come advice kita takde macam
seek uh clique clique mana ada kita open seh open macam ni
whoever nak join join asalkan kau uh you have that
you I mean uh sometimes you are good you know I mean kau kau orang baik tak payah macam pandai ke apa tak payah tak we don't we don't we don't do that
no kita tak kita tak
ya and now that we are matured right kita punya topic pun makin mature eh
friend pun kita dah macam we we we talk about mature stuff now and also confirm kita ada joke around but
we we kita takde mahu kita we we don't like really like judge people I think
tapi that's that's the that's the good thing about our
yes aku aku respect beauty those people who I find really pretty right aku macam aku macam respects seh like you know what I mean like like macam celebrities I would like wah
like wow you know what I mean macam uh models yang macam handsome pun aku macam wow you know like
aku aku take that as a role model you know like wow that that is
macam wow lah you know what I mean
there are some macam kau tahu you know mira filzah tak
dia punya beauty kan
and her personality oh my god dia full package you know she got the personality she got the great voice dia punya voice kan lemah lembut kan and then dia pun lawa dia dia okay
dia tak lawa lawa tau
but her lawa is very sweet type you know what I mean macam kau like sedap mata memandang you know what I mean macam you you you can just like look macam
that kind of beauty aku macam respect sia aku aku aku tabik
wah that is good that is the best kalau you've you got the full package you know that you are beauty and then you are humble about it wah
kalau kalau western pun kau kau handsome tak western kalau western hollywood style
kalau aku siapa eh
okay we we okay we we don't know like their personality how lah but but there we but we appreciate their dia orang punya beauty
yes we appreciate kita tak macam
jealous or judge you know like eh rambut kau lawa tak tak eh no no uh when when we judge is because kau punya character
like like you you are you you you are pretty but then you are like very snobbish or like you are very arrogant and that that is when we like macam alamak come on lah you waste you waste your beauty
why waste your beauty but you know some people don't know that macam
like macam you know what I mean it's it's how you are brought up juga lah how does everyone
she's beautiful to me and her character macam yang macam motherly kind of uh you know what I mean of how she brings me out aku
of a role model like wow like like macam
macam kita kita we wanna be someone like that you know what I mean
we wanna be someone like that that's that's what I see macam
and and how dia macam ajar like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
macam ajar then wah
um tak payah cakap pasal beauty lah it's macam dia punya attitude wise you know what I mean
the is that tapi kalau macam if you want to say like like western punya or like macam barat
uh pelakon ke apa kan then I would say neelofa
is the ya malaysian punya actress host uh business woman sebab kan uh kalau kau tak tahu kan dia buat this brand apa yang neelofa punya tudung and then she's she's she's successful sampai pergi uh
milan uh to the the business berkembang
she is a great uh host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something dia masih belum berpunya she's still single but her driven of uh being that success both dunia and akhirat aku boleh cakap
it's it's like wah macam
it's something that macam you god bless you you know
uh role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and uh of a islam uh muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing apa tadi kau nak cakap
betul betul betul the I mean the the the life the hereafter lah
ya tu oh my god singapore living ya
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is wow I think memang it's very rare no not just both tapi your character pun baik your personality pun baik
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost macam
role model lah I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man yang macam you know that you have okay for the guys handsome uh bekerjaya and um uh apa we can cakap apa faithful is it faithful and then um of a good personality then
memang susah nak cari but these are the people yang macam you risau tapi again to those yang kita okay kita boleh uh rumuskan eh sebab we got like a few more minutes tapi um what I can say is that we shouldn't just um we shouldn't just
uh okay what's that word eh I want to say that this kau tahu kan macam kita kita jangan just tengok yang lawa kita just tengok yang handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't err okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance sebab
it will just make you rasa diri you yang kalau you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we atau whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down what like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this macam successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself kalau just you know what I mean like
betul you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of uh just be humble be kind I think kalau at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character betul tak
so just ya just be on that don't worry kalau
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly macam choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you macam you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know bila
so then you just be humble lah macam
you know what I mean macam we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then baru kita move on to ten years down the road what should we
macam it it it has come to a point where
macam because of beauty lah because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself ni macam takde value
and it has come to a point where macam whatever people take one for me aku macam mengalah aku like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
to have like prioritise in me sebab I I tend to like
to like macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang seh
you know what I mean so it has I should be more macam have that confidence which I I aku tu tu last time eh tu last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
so to the next ya uh future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road apa kau punya advice
true true that is that is important and macam to just have that little selfishness in you so that
ni is important betul okay
ellen punya ellen put aside eh tapi tapi
betul this is my pendirian I know where
higher status kau manager your kau they treat me they treat us macam kita ni beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I aku macam to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day aku
treating people nice is you is a must sebab how can you judge sebab I got people around me macam they they judge okay for example
kalau kau punya job uh macam uh cleaning wise ke apa kan
kau why would you uh I've seen this this is another topic err like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern eh I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because uh kita they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like uh kuli we are like beginner
kita macam baru masuk industry then they they they bully us they they not just uh okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment tapi if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like macam kita sampah or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like oh my god you you you you forget where you where you start you kau kau dah lupa diri kan this is what happen when kita lupa diri so I I I just want to advice myself that oh my god please
nadia don't ever lupa diri sebab one day kalau I get that extra money ke I get that extra title ke I might forget about myself and people below me
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know bila this uh blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's uh
alright one okay one two three kita press eh
eh tak kan mesti lah miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
kita nak buat buat seh
um you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling atau lepas COVID nak pergi mana
kalau before COVID
um I won't say most value for money tapi dekat
um dengan dia lawa
ya tu ah I think ah that time I pergi in twenty
sixteen tu I pergi um
okay ah I tak I didn't get to enjoy
tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah go camper van dekat dengan go
uh australia I rasa kalau kita dapat camper van kat new zealand
confirm lawa gila ah
tu ah tapi ya lah macam macam ah jadi kalau macam
kita punya camper van berlubang
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay lah tasmania best lah sebab dapat naik the ocean liner kan travel from melbourne to tasmania tapi
um sydney dengan sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family yang follow jadi
rasa macam best ah sebab you enjoy more with them
ya lepas tu yang kita you makan kat perfect catch
tu pun best ah fish and chips by the river power sia
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to punya fish and chips fish and chips
punya lah tak sedap
ya I went to new zealand dengan my aunties lah and my cousins
err well uh bila you pergi dengan um makcik-makcik ah dia orang punya level of err worry is more because they feel that they are responsible lah for you
I tahu ah tapi bila you dah dengan makcik-makcik I
err dia orang dah eh tak mahu lah tak mahu lah
dia dah pergi counter dah pergi bayar
alih-alih he was walking on the platform
it must be ticked are you fit ada sakit apa-apa tak you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera benda-benda macam gini semua biasa lah kena fill
so they give you a cert lah to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and nah ambil kau punya cert
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tak tak minum ah eh ah kita pergi pub ordered hot chocolate
kita pergi pub pergi pub err hot chocolate tengok bola kat luar
tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan it was raining
um and then bila esok pagi
sekali tiba-tiba um snow fell
lepas tu bila when there was snow err we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
um the advisory was tak boleh drive on the road dulu
and then um apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow yang christchurch um felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so macam lama gila ah lama tak boleh snow macam gitu
ya betul I think that was the first time I rasa snow
err unique experience ah sebab
tak pernah nampak snow kan so
ya ya ya we memang kita tahu it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves lah
err not for snow but I mean just winter kita tak tahu pun there was snow that was gonna happen
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana
the tour company decided okay nevermind we err board the bus and lepas tu drove to another hotel
and um ya we basically tidur kat hotel baru
tapi yang tak bestnya pasal new zealand
um winter obvious sejuk lepas tu
winter sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis
semua benda semua kedai dah tutup then so it was quite boring lah for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that wow at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but tengok so it was kind of boring ah but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night ke two extra night
so hot chocolate ah sedap
tu bukan lah tu some pumpkin spice kan
dekat queen victoria market kan
ah eh tu biasa pasal kita terus makan donut dia kat luar
wah camper van experience lain eh I think
mm ya lah I think by then kita orang macam dah penat I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then uh by the time nightfall kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal lah having wildlife a wombat benda yang
tak pernah nampak kat singapore tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk camper van
melampau jer
ya tu pasal lah
kita tak akan dapat experience benda-benda macam ini sebab tours chances are
ya and I think um partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life sebab
sebab your time is yours
I think yang even on that trip lah yang we kita turun tengok the river delta kan ya
tu ah tak tak sabar tunggu ni COVID habis
lepas COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination lah I'm don't even wanna go
ya tapi kalau you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
jadi kita kasih lah orang yang nak fly fly dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi
kita pergi apa yang kita mampu jer iaitu K
ya tapi okay so there are two ways to go about doing it biasa orang drive
lepas tu tidur rest one night and then esok pagi just sambung pergi border of thailand
ya that one more relax ah takde kelam kabut takde macam rushing for time
drive ke tidur semalam
lepas tu ah pergi penang
nanti lah belum buka tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar
selangor tengah highest for COVID numbers
ya so boleh ah lepas tu lepas dah tidur satu malam pergi penang satu malam baru pergi thailand tapi tu dah kira dua hari ah
kalau nak cepat then tidur penang satu hari esok kita pergi thailand ataupun lagi nak cepat terus to thailand ah tapi penat ah badan sebab it will probably be macam
empat belas jam on the road ah so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired ah
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand kalau the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
lepas tu travel around southern thailand
err I don't know ah tak pernah try tapi jangan bawa kereta ah jangan bawa kereta in
you sewa kereta dekat thailand
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring lah so what I want is kita save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore ah
naik kapal terbang nak sangat kan kapal terbang ah naik ah kapal terbang
okay lah memang best lah tak cakap tak best tapi
tak lah bruny boring lah kirakan macam boat dia kecil apa
oh tu juga
bukan bunker lah cabin lah
okay lah tapi malam we kita tak travel malam so you were travelling at
I mean bila kita baru-baru masuk when the boat started to sail
by the time kita dah tertidur boat dia probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled lah kan when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat lah
then bila pagi dah bangun
lain okay lah I mean dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi I think because of the space that they have
and harga tak so mahal lah
ya because they are fresh produced ah benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap
memang lah
tapi tu ah since
oh dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best ah
okay sabar which one do you prefer you lagi suka van diemen's punya ice cream ke you lagi suka gelato messina
van diemen's was ya betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah farm
macam-macam ah gelato messina ada macam-macam flavour
tapi yang amorino punya
amorino punya I think kita makan
kejap I tak ingat whether that one were trip ke
ah tak salah tu ah
ya I like messina better sebab I rasa
ya tu yang best dia ah
because kalau you you compare van diemen's van diemen's punya flavours are
it's not anything out of the ordinary lah macam K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
kan atau
K lah apple cranberry pun boleh katakan
ada apa yang dekat tu dekat tom's palette
okay tom's palette ke gelato messina
ya ke
but then tom's palette sedap seh
tapi it could also be the fact that
benda tu kita tak pernah try ah contoh eh contoh
when we went to borong market alright K break your head right
I I wouldn't say that sebab dulu dunkin donut pernah ada with their bavarian cream
tapi the the ones that dunkin donut jual tak sesedap ah
ya okay so kalau you imagine ah break your head you punya donut the dough is soft
inti dia penuh kan
which I am inclined to agree sebab about I haven't tasted
tak pada I macam lebih pada okay like
I felt that it was a cross between lemak cili padi dengan uh apa thai green curry
ada lah iras-iras dia
dah dah lepas tu I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den ah dragon's den dragon's den is this uh british show
investors yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak shark tank ah macam shark tank ah
so dragon's den dengan shark tank lebih kurang ah sama ah
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not ah but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted kirakan you bagus ah
ya okay think about it eh kalau you kata you miss the food overseas
no lah just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you cakap oh I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay lah when travel kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example macam
macam makan kat noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
right like like mi dengan
ya so if you were to think about it again macam is it really that fantastic
ah tu ah faham tak
ya it's the spices sebab dia orang okay imagine nandos
so nandos kan macam oh nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
kan ada sudu garfu
that thick milkshake sedap gila
tak boleh replicate ah eh so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop kita masuk
K ah penat saje nak duduk
and baam sedap gila apa tempat ni
betul juga okay lah maybe I think oh what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the ni lah factory outlets
tapi tu bicester village elite ah up ah
bicester ke bister
bukan bicester eh
ya but I think the york punya outlets err better ah
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van um battery mati
tak yang job dia
ah kita dah
so kita travel all the way up untuk pergi york
that's true lah tapi macam travel untuk two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that macam mm
ah tak ada theme park ah
float apa
bukan luga kan
tapi tu mahal ah I rasa
mahal lah I think
tak salah adults
fifty alah fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama ah
maze kat sana ah
haunted house apa
eh itu mengarut seh
eh tu mengarut gila buang buang masa saya pergi tu
ya lah tak menyeramkan langsung
sabar ni trip ke err
is partly because of the weather kan they humid tapi dia panas ah
so walaupun masuk hutan err I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
tapi bila kat dalam panas juga ah sebab takde angin ah
compared to bila kita travel dekat you ingat tak yang kita pergi tasmania
cari waterfall
yang kita cari waterfall tu kan
oh ya K ah at least bila kat dalam sana
dia sejuk sikit oh
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat ah
kalau nak pergi taman negara berpuluh lawa ah saya confirm
err at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu ah euro two thousand eight lah
ya kalau kalau travel as a student
how much you are going to spend so macam for us while kita pergi sana we either just took the
atau kita ambil um kita ambil apa the the budget flight ah
so we were from netherlands kita travel to belgium via bus
kita dah terlepas the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
jauh I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium lah mana belgium is germany
so kita terlepas so konon-konon nak naik taxi ah the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks ah ya
tak juga ah we were winging it lah
ah ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab lepas tu
kita cakap dengan pakcik ni ah driver we need to get to this airport so dia kata that sixty kilometres away
at least macam
so you macam dah alamak macam mana eh but the worst part is that we will we had no money ah there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
no bukan takde duit lah but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang lah kan
habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita hundred and this one ah more than hundred twenty euro habis kita dah duit dah sikit then kita macam alamak macam mana eh
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and nanti I will show you all
dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya trip ni lagi mahal lah
ya lah I I think sama ah macam benda ini juga so dia on
dia on dia punya meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter dah naik two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
lepas tu he said
ya and then dia kata okay you look ah at the meter
sekarang dah hundred three hundred and twenty euro aku off K aku off
ya starting tu dah adventure ah
no but I think kalau spain kalah confirm raih ah
ah but because spain won err I think I think through penalties eh spain menang italy and then ah because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the um there was a big screen dia orang err live telecast
so kita ramai-ramai ah kat sana sama tengok live telecast lah
the trains tutup sia
jalan ah
ah jalan ah so tak ni lah ni dah madrid ah ni dah madrid so madrid dah macam
lepas portugal so kita pergi
so it was netherlands lepas tu ambil bus pergi belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal pergi um flight to madrid
all the way makan ni ah roti dengan tuna ah
tak lah everyday but basically living frugally ah
um my friend and I lah kita dah dah dah lapar ah
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
you go through your hostel dot com ke apa ah
so um jumpa ah kedai kedai muslim ni ah semua muslim brother dah masuk kedai dia apparently kita ternampak ada prata ah
prata ah so macam prata ah
so I don't know whether it was ah an instant prata or prata that they made ah tapi nampak macam prata ah
so my friend and I eh baik ah this harapan prata puas hati lah kan
tu kita dah tengah lapar so kita minta dia enam ah enam eh kau tiga aku tiga lah enam
itu tak perasan lah sebab kita dah tengah lapar ah and harga dia harga tak mahal sangat lah
true dah tengah lapar ah so kita dah okay ah enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar and he couldn't speak english
ah macam gitu ah so dia ah sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu
then macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar
apparently dia orang makan order prata dengan macam sirap ke gula ah
tak I think they tuang the sugar on top ah
so kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
tu pasal lah dia ni dia ni kira macam muslim brother boleh pakai punya ah
and then uh you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita keluar um maybe like after one or after the two
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four ke two to five ah
so it's okay lah as in dia orang tutup sekejap for them to rest lepas tu dia orang buka sampai maybe sepuluh sebelas
oh err in madrid juga I where where when we were walking ah masih masih masih
sekali tiba-tiba there was this bangladeshi guy
kita dah kat madrid eh dia orang bual bual melayu eh muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak
ada pernah kerja kat malaysia
I mean if the opportunity presents itself nak lah kan
kalau ada kerja yang bagus okay ah
ah lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana I mean
kalau kita kat singapore kalau bulan puasa kan macam
okay babe I ada soalan I nak tanya you kalau COVID nineteen benda ni semua dah selesai
kita tak perlu susah payah nak quarantine ke nak stay home notice ke nak risau tentang leave kita cukup ke tidak you rasanya you nak pergi mana holiday kalau boleh
bulan bulan march err tahun ni ke atau tahun
oh tahun ni
oh okay tapi you dah beli air ticket ke belum
AirAsia ke Singapore Airlines
oh okay tapi kalau depa dah refund sepatutnya okay lah
I ada dengar juga kawan I cakap AirAsia tak boleh refund langsung atau partial refund atau
you know maybe they will just macam postpone lah their trip sampai tak tahu lah bila
tapi kalau okay japan ni you pernah pergi ke tidak atau ni kali pertama
mm dah lima kali okay
so then tapi okinawa is first time atau bukan
ya so I rasa macam kalau boleh kan quarantine ni dah selesai tak perlu susah payah macam ni sangkut dalam rumah
I nak pergi jumpa boyfriend I sebab
kan kita ni memang long distance relationship dah kan tapi lapan bulan dah tak jumpa
kalau boleh I nak gi perth lah sebab I rasa macam
perth ni bila I gi kat situ um
selalunya rasa macam very peaceful
kacau I
so I can like eat and sleep and relax or maybe because I'm on leave juga lah
so tak rasa macam stressed sangat
oh betul ke tapi australia you pernah pergi ke tak
okay boleh juga ajak you lah ah okay lah
so ya so I pernah pergi ke sydney sekali
melbourne sekali yang dua-dua kali dengan mum I lah dengan my mak
sekali dengan mak I juga and then I've been to perth I think this time dah kira the third time lah
next year kalau boleh I nak gi lah tapi
because sekarang
kan australia punya borders err rasa rasanya dalam Berita Harian  dah tertulis
they tutup sampai
tahun twenty twenty one
oh betul ke and you tak pernah visit
you should you should so then macam mana dengan
person that suka holiday suka keluar err
for new adventure tengok new adventure see new things so during
err tahun ni kan semasa lockdown uh semasa COVID you ada rasa macam you
you suffocating a bit ke tak like you know um like you cannot go on holiday you ada rasa macam mana
during circuit breaker at that time I was renting my room dengan ni house mates I
and at that time there was like five of us in the house so tak rasa macam lonely sangat lah
because sebelum ni kan
you memang tahu I tak tahu
memasak langsung so I didn't know how to cook um nasi pun tak tahu lor so then it's like
susah sikit lah
then I had to macam ask
I was very lucky that during the lockdown I tinggal dengan mereka lah at that time ah
boleh boleh makan lah but then there was this one time bila I masak uh kari ikan
salmon salmon I okay boleh makan tapi curry dia I think sebab I added too much water
so rasa dia macam air instead of or is rasa dia macam salmon soup instead of salmon curry lah
hais you tahu tak hari tu because I'm thinking to myself
that you ni kan memang drive and I take public transportation
so I was thinking hari tu kan you know outside rumah I ni I was sleeping very soundly by myself and you know just
dia accident
betapa kuatnya I heard bang
and I was like apa jadi ah
look out the window but then tak nampak apa apa then kawan I ternampak
memang yang accident tu teruk lah dengan motosikal
then kereta depan dia memang hempas sampai the whole thing is spoilt lah
kemek already crash already lah
ya so then after that few minutes later you can terdengar lah ambulance tu
ah betul
mm betul tapi you pernah kena accident tak
so far pernah
okay pas tu
wah kereta dia terbakar
I rasa macam I ada nampak
video tu kan I think ya no bukan nampak kereta dia kat tampines tapi I think I rasa I nampak video dia kat TikTok
sebab biasanya usually kalau ada accident kat singapore ke apa apa yang terjadi dia akan upload dalam TikTok
so macam tu lah so talking about the news um do you follow tak the the punya politician semua
mm I nampak tapi I macam tak faham
faham lah
sepatutnya I nak pergi shopping tapi I rasa macam hais
you know kena save money lah
and then you know uh tapi I rasa macam the houses here pun sekarang
getting more expensive and kalau tak I kena you know buy like somewhere further away from the city and it's not convenient sebab I tak pandu kereta kan
so macam tu lah eh you ada siblings ke tak
oh I tak tahu pun you ada siblings
okay so your big brother buat apa
tak ada lah I ni kan only child
so that's why that's why like you know my parents I kena take care of them lah
so that's why during this COVID nineteen time I worried sikit lah sebab kan they are walking around in singapore
I takut lah kalau ada apa apa yang jadi especially bila that time when the domestic workers the numbers were increasing and
you tahu lah parents ni tua-tua yang semua tua-tua ni kan
bila kita bagi tahu jangan keluar dari rumah sebab sekarang ni kan COVID dangerous especially if you are high risk
risiko tinggi kan jangan lah keluar sebab
macam diabetes high cholesterol
err like macam mak I she's had a stroke before it's it's dangerous lah to to bahaya lah to go out
things in public kan and taking the public transport and dia ambil juga
so that's why memang tak nak dengar lah so susah sikit lah so like I was very worried for my parents but then it looks like
the numbers here in singapore is dwindling is is sudah semakin kurang
so nampaknya macam okay we're getting better
but then you tahu tak what is the difference between phase three dengan phase two sebab I tak tahu
yang tu jer
tapi I rasa macam activity tu not so important actually the ones that is more important to me is the travelling part lah
ah betul juga
but then like travel bubble kalau you boleh cadangkan travel bubble you rasa travel bubble dengan siapa
you get to pick five countries yang mana lima country yang you rasa you nak
you nak travel bubble dengan
tapi philippines dengan indonesia I would be very afraid
because philippines is uh dengan indonesia
ya because the two of them sekarang ni memang tengah competing and then philippines competing to be the winner
so rasa macam I don't I would not feel safe kalau we have travel bubble dengan mereka
ah new zealand new zealand is good ya memang cantik and I heard the prime minister is very good also mm
so ya I heard she has been doing her very well with the number of the COVID nineteen cases lah di di negara dia kan
so macam tu lah so biasanya you ada baca news kan Channel News Asia
yang macam mana yang ada apa like
apa rapist siapa
dalam Channel News Asia they reported that oh my god that is so sad kan
esok uh kerja lah apa lagi aiyo so everytime
uh kerja memang kerja from work from home lah tapi once I think about kerja I macam stressed sikit because I've been working twenty four seven
so I rasa macam I need a break lah
I tak boleh visit rumah orang tua lah sia COVID
macam mana I nak visit orang tua tak boleh lah
malas lah I rasa macam I kat duduk kat rumah I sleep cukup
ya betul
everytime tak boleh tidur because got problems trying to sleep lah insomnia kan
mm but then I don't want to take too much ubat also I want to make sure that I can fall asleep naturally
my house mate kan dia balik
then dia tidur kat sini
boyfriend dia tak ada so boyfriend dia tinggal kat tempat dia sendiri lah so
managed to buy me McDonald's breakfast dia ada buy one for one
ah murah
so macam tu lah eh you tahu tak rambut I kan lepas I dye dia merah dah kan
warna dia when my rambut is wet kan warna dia masih like
terlekat kat pillow I
you know my hair ni memang kan red
so I rasa macam
the hair dye that the hairdresser used tak berapa bagus ah because everytime I after when it's wet it's wet
two weeks already and it's will still stain baju kau there is no way that the thing is still like that betul tak
ya exactly this is lepas dua minggu dah and then dia masih stain baju dengan
but only bila dia basah
so it stained like my towel juga lah stain stain merah
mana boleh kalau kering pun it's uh ya but it's
[ah] betul there ah
so but then ah dia beli lah during um during apa ni
Harvey Norman singapore ada sales
jadi dia beli dari Harvey Norman lah
ya it was a a birthday surprise dia order dari Harvey Norman singapore
Harvey Norman singapore tu deliver kat I lah mm and I didn't know then when they ring the doorbell I was like
there was memang kelakar lah because the guy was like this one is for you I said I didn't order this he said oh your mum
so macam tu lah
oh we said we wanted to go to apa ni
and then kita masih belum pergi Holey Moley kan
I pernah dah ajak tapi you sibuk apa
kawan I lah yang seorang lagi
a'ah betul
ya tapi I ajak you you tak reply
sebab I tanya you nak pergi ke tak
pas tu you kau tak reply
tak tahu lah you busy every day lah ada banyak kawan kau
ah betul
uh kalau cycling I pengsan
susah lah I cannot lah if you ask me to go and do all these things
mm betul
ah tak boleh lah exercise
I tahu tapi I you you kan tahu I ni memang malas
nanti gemuk lah
it's okay lah kalau I gemuk
memang lah
oh and then you tahu tak
like sekarang ni kan I memang nak invest in stocks tapi I tak tahu macam mana
do you invest in stocks ke tak
orh I nak tapi I tak tahu macam mana nak start
oh boleh ke
tapi I nak ah
so you dah invest lama ke
oh dah lama ke
because I because I masih muda lagi kan
so I ni kena like willing to take the risk lah
mmhmm betul betul
okay tapi I nak start dengan
okay bagus
tapi because
if you want to invest in the share market you kena apa ni you kena start an account with with your bank right
is it with your banks or bukan macam tu
so macam macam lah
ya kalau gitu pun
ha betul lah
tak ada lah
tak ada lah tak ada investment
sebab itu lah susah sikit that's why I need to start thinking about my future kan
then like worried about like money and then sekarang job I ni pun tak ada commission
so I kena that's why I sekarang ni sibuk nak cari back a sales job so that I can get a bit of commission
project project macam ini kalau kita ada lebih then I don't have to worry so much
kalau project project macam ni memang lah I nak join
so rasanya tak tahu lah kalau mm
the share market investment I memang interested lah but then like
memang nak ah sebab tu that's why originally I was saving up my money untuk apa ni um
untuk sebab I nak belajar sepatutnya
tapi tu juga memang mahal kat
enam puluh ribu lebih susah lah
I rasa macam kalau boleh I nak study medicine juga tapi medicine kan I was thinking should I actually like
so but then career change susah sikit because like
macam mana I nak career change where do I start even kan so kalau I nak buat medicine medicine pun mahal
medicine is kira kira kalau kita study dekat australia
yang tu boleh but then but then you need to have the other additional like training lah
ah other additional training kalau you study dekat australia boleh sebab I ada seorang kawan dia memang
dia study kat monash university and then dia doctor lah kat sini
but then medicine tu mahal lah so
these kind of things you need money also if you want to switch your career and how you want to start all over and get certified so susah sikit lah
tengok lah that's why I pun tak tahu
no it's okay yang tu is out of the window I tak mahu
I nak kerja untuk diri sendiri I nak make sure that you know the money in the bank is mine and that
I tak dependent lah on anybody
parents okay lah kan parents kat singapore macam tu lah
tapi susah sikit lah because you know memang
so when you have two old parents here in singapore you kena
tak tahu lah
ada lah tapi pun susah nak keluarkan so kena tengok lah macam mana
ya betul
so tengok macam mana lah
biasanya bapa yang tak nak pi holiday mak yang nak mak nak pi holiday lah mak pernah pi holiday juga mak I bawa dia pi
I bawa dia pi aiyo banyak tempat lah sebab the job before this kan memang I had to travel and at that time
tak ada COVID lagi tak ada uh tak ada restrictions for travelling so
rasanya I brought her to a lot of places I brought her to
mm mana lagi I brought her to
at first originally kita nak pi vietnam this year sepatutnya I nak bawa dia pi vietnam especially end of the year when it's cold
either vietnam ke chiang mai because she likes cold places lah
and then I wanted to take her to cold places that is not expensive tak terlalu mahal kan
so vietnam atau chiang mai lah tapi sekarang mana mana pun tak boleh pi
so susah sikit lah duduk rumah tengok Netflix jer lah
tak tahu lah
aiyo dia ni
bapa I pun satu suruh dia pi suruh dia pi holiday
johor pun dia tak nak pergi
ah so memang susah lah sikit
ya lah mak I pernah pernah lah she wanted to go via this
travel agency pi holiday tapi susah sikit lah kalau you pi with travel agency I takut
mm tapi kalau they travel with travel agent kan
bukannya mahal ke because they will bring you to all these touristy areas
that like you know that akan charge you like really high prices
so susah sikit bukan
even makanan juga dia bawa you tempat yang mahal
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul lah
mm betul juga
lazarus island tu yang paling jauh I pergi ah duduk ferry tu pun I tertidur dalam ferry
oh betul ke you pernah pergi ke lazarus island oh
oh macam mana hari tu kau pergi
oh betul ke berpeluh
tapi hari tu bila I pi kan cuaca tu tak berapa baik
aku ambil umbrella tu abeh aku jalan from one from since the jetty
to the beach aku dalam umbrella tu sahaja
pas tu we were there only for one hour I dengan kawan I
kawan I ni lah kan dia yang ajak aku pi
then macam mana aku nak dia pun cakap ah tak apa tak apa
nanti tak akan hujan aku memang dah tanya dia aku tanya oh okay even though we have bought the ferry ticket
you nak tukar ke another day ah because
kan sekarang ni hujan lebat then we go there we cannot even picnic ke nak buat apa apa pun tak ada then umbrella pun kecil sangat
so then after that dia cakap tak apa tak apa hujan tak hujan akan err nanti dia akan
uh reda dah ah so kita continue with our trip anyway
so I cakap okay lah continue with our trip and then
enam orang lima orang sorry bukan enam
oh ya betul juga I terlupa lima orang ugh
nampak pula a'ah betul
ya kenapa pula I boleh terkira tambah seorang ah okay tak apa so ada lima orang kan
and payung tu memang kecil kecil ha
and then almost lah the wind blew away the payung and everything so end up we all just sat kat jetty tu waited for the ferry for two hours
ya tapi I memang suka bila dia cuaca tak berapa panas kan bila dia cuaca hujan I memang suka
kan I nak pergi tapi tengok lah kalau weekday I memang tak boleh sebab I kena ambil leave kalau weekend okay lah tapi weekend susah juga sebab I takut ramai orang lah
I ni memang kena clear leave tapi I tak nak ambil
I tak nak ambil leave on a on a weekday that is like a random day kan because I takut like
my boss will also kacau I
ah the the most strategic way of doing this is bila boss I
ah so dia tak akan kacau I
mm betul juga
mm so macam tu lah
huh you go all the way for a massage don't you think that's like really far away tak akan singapore tak ada massage kat sini
oh so biasanya you pandu kereta pergi situ bukan ambil uh apa ni ambil uh train lah
this neighbour of mine kan dia ni memang suka suka
buang sampah dia kat
luar the place where they are supposed to throw the rubbish bukan dalam chute tu tapi buang dekat luar
tak tahu lah and then uh
no or sometimes dia memang dah buka itu chute
so like tapi dia tak tutup properly so then or or they didn't push the rubbish properly into the chute all the way down
so bila I nak buang sampah when I bawa keluar I buka tu sampah tu masih ada kat situ
memang lah macam itu
ya so I wrote an email to management lah then I suruh management please remind everybody to
management cakap okay ah do you know who is in err who is the culprit
mana I boleh tahu hais ask me this kind of questions
macam tu lah
mm betul
minggu ni tak ada lah I nak tidur then I nak tengok Netflix
Netflix sekarang ni I nak tengok uh weekend ni I nak tengok enola holmes and then I nak tengok
I nak tengok
movie tu err kau rasa cinta
kau tak pernah dengar ke movie tu kau rasa cinta
ada lah movie ni popular
because I scared later I fall asleep lah when I tengok K drama
kau ada nampak video TikTok tu yang I bagi you tengok semalam tak
kelakar kan
ya I think I probably spend like six hours on TikTok I even like I ada pun uh send apa ni my job application to TikTok juga
I memang nak kerja dengan TikTok kalau TikTok nak hire I I memang nak
so technically kan I ni memang TikTok researcher dah
so kalau dia nak hire I I boleh cakap this is the amount of time I spend on your product I memang boleh join product you
tak nak lah
as if boleh jadi popular dengan TikTok bukannya senang sangat
tak ada lah
mana boleh senang lah cakap but then when you want to do it kan memang difficult a bit lah
memang uh okay I don't think my voice is merdu lah tapi tengok macam mana lah
malay song mm macam boleh juga tapi I rasa macam bila I cakap malay it's smoother lah kalau nyanyi malay not so
mm eh you tahu tak hari tu kan um
I pergi Holey Moley dengan norza kan I dah cakap tadi
this one seorang lelaki ni dia memang kerja kat situ as a waiter
then after that dia cakap kalau
uh if if he dia memang singaporean lah tapi dia ada relatives kat malaysia
budak melayu lah ni so then after that dia cakap oh um next time kalau you nak make booking kat Holey Moley for a table reservation ke apa you boleh call I lah
so dia ambil nombor I
then after that dia letak mm ah then then dia ambil nombor I then dia letak nombor dia dalam telefon I sebab telephone I memang ada kat
kat meja so then dia cakap eh you ambil lah nombor telephone I so next time kalau you nak reserve apa ke
you boleh call I so I cakap okay that's fine I'll do it
dia asyik text I
and I dah bagi tahu dia yang memang I dah ada boyfriend
and dia cakap oh
uh kalau dia dia cakap hari tu dia cakap apa ah
uh dia cakap oh
um bila you free
I nak bawa you keluar uh and then dia then dia cakap I nak bawa you keluar dengan Vespa I
Vespa dia then aku cakap um
kenapa I nak duduk Vespa kalau public transportation memang ada air con
then tapi ya so no lah but it's not just that it was like I dah memang dah bagi tahu yang I ada boyfriend
tapi dia masih muka tebal tau and then dia masih text I so I rasa macam
that's really weird so I I just straight up was like honest dengan dia and I bagi tahu lah that like
ah so I rasa macam dia tak ada boundary actually the thing was
I only save nombor dia sebab dia cakap
that kalau next time I nak reserve table I boleh call dia so I ingat like service dia bagus ke apa I wanted to write like a feedback on Facebook
kat Holey Moley yang dia ni memang baik ke apa
tapi turns out dia ni memang tak like like
asyik kacau I jer so I rasa macam a bit
mm macam tu lah
uh saya rasa I saya tak nak
I memang dah berterus terang I dah cakap I ada boyfriend
then after that dia ah then dia masih muka tebal lagi dia cakap oh
oh um I okay jer uh because dia cakap oh
um um so I would like to invite you for my birthday dinner then I'm I cakap
ah then aku rasa aku tanya dia only you and me
then dia cakap tak lah then they said uh then he said
dengan kawan kawan I
then dia cakap with a group of friends bukan you dengan I jer then the then he said
I tahu you you you tak you tak nak hang out one on one
tapi I okay jer
then I rasa macam the way he responded to it was very
it doesn't matter if you are okay with it ke tidak because you are
tapi kalau orang dah ada boyfriend atau girlfriend I don't think it's
ah so macam tu lah
then then aku tanya dia just you and I then dia cakap tak lah dengan kawan kawan I
tapi dia masih hari ni lagi ajak I pergi birthday dinner
pas tu I cakap
dia and then the way dia cakap kan
dia text I dia cakap oh
so I was but bukan I yang ajak dia keluar dia yang nak ajak I then I was like
mungkin you kena panggil uh then I said err maybe you just enjoy with your friends lah and have a good
pas tu dia cakap um
dia cakap err
bila I free
so it's like again you are coming back to that topic when I dah cakap
I memang dah tak bagi signal apa I tak uh it it's totally no signal it's disconnected
so I rasa macam it's just
ya but any way aku dah tak reply dia lah
ya betul juga
bukan lah dah pernah happen a number of times
no lah I mean uh no but anyway ya that was just off topic so coming back to this um apa ni COVID kan so um
in london COVID nineteen memang dah um
mm macam that time dalam kat australia
mm yang tu pernah happen dalam japan pun and then now they said that the
the virus dah mutate
betul juga but then only the young ones will have herd immunity the old ones would not be able to survive or the ones with underlying disease
so yang tu yang susah lah
mm tapi vaccine sekarang pun macam ada side effect
because I think sekarang ada tiga company yang tengah buat vaccine
no there is one that's Sanofi albert dengan AstraZeneca
Pfizer juga I think all of them are on board with that kot
sekarang ni albert memang memang apa ni uh memang aggressive to to do COVID because I nampak ada
for a number of um albert punya infectious disease department
ada lah tapi dia tak call I balik because I tak ada experience dalam infectious disease kot
mungkin boleh juga tengok macam mana lah
ada lah I think now they are busy with the campaign the presidential campaign it feels like I feel like this COVID thing has
yang U orang dengan dengan like
so that's why it turns out everybody pula yang terkena COVID
I rasa lah yang ni I rasa lah
ya betul
ya betul
betul lah
mm betul juga
but it's true I mean uh you know negara kita ni
memang lebih bagus lah
negara lain lain di southeast asia tapi negara kita ni memang
memang you know as much as what anybody else says negara kita ni memang terbaik
orang orang lain nak masuk negara kita untuk kerja kan orang malaysia ni
orang indonesia
orang china orang philippines kan ah
there err and memang ada semangat
nationality lah kat singapore
mm betul
ah ang moh tu apa ang moh
oh ang moh tu orang putih lah
oh okay okay ha betul lah
ya betul
jadi mungkin minggu ni kita nak pi botanical gardens ke tak
ya sebab I rasa
betul juga sebab I rasa macam botanical gardens ada satu cafe yang memang cantik
then dia ada like I pernah pergi dah lama dah um
and then dia ada yang rooftop tu memang glass rooftop and dia transparent and then boleh nampak everything
bukan Wildseed Wildseed ke kat botanical gardens bukan Wildseed tu terlalu
nampak dia terlalu nice and terlalu expensive yang tempat ni memang basic tapi makanan dia okay juga
mm tak tahu kalau ramai ke tak mungkin kita kalau kita pergi
pagi-pagi kan then tak akan lah begitu
jadi kau tidur lah awal sikit
okay then kalau gitu kan I dah cakap
kita pergi botanical gardens makan breakfast so macam mana kita nak makan breakfast kalau nanti lambat lambat
okay boleh juga
kalau ramai tengok lah kalau boleh reserve ke apa nanti kita Google lah
mm lepas botanical gardens I nak pergi
mm I nak balik tidur
sebab you kan tahu I ni memang bangun awal okay kalau lepas botanical gardens maybe kita gi orchard tengok ada benda nak shopping ke tak
ramai orang kan a'ah ya lah
so okay kalau tak pergi orchard then kita nak pergi mana lepas ni eh
ah sentosa buat apa sentosa tu memang kena booking sekarang kau tahu tak
kena chope
to masuk
sebab tu everywhere sekarang ni kena chope then baik tinggal kat rumah jer aku tengok Netflix lah cukup
mm boleh juga tapi kan you sebab you pandu kereta so senang sikit tapi kalau untuk I I kena like
tengok mana yang convenient sikit kalau terlalu jauh I memang
you tahu lah I ni memang singaporean
kalau jauh sangat I tak nak travel
kalau I tak ada kereta lah kalau ada kereta okay lah
ya betul lah
mm boleh juga
boleh boleh juga mm
jadi I rasa macam
ah okay lah dah lewat
and I pun sudah nak tidur you dah nak tidur ke tak
mm betul I juga
esok I kerja tapi lepas ni I akan kerja lagi sebab I kena habiskan benda mmhmm
selalu banyak lah tapi I'm I also like procrastinated a little bit
because I rasa macam malas nak kerja cause every day I've been working non-stop kan
hmm so rasa macam tired sikit lah but I need to finish this project
betul lah
ya betul because um tadi house mate I baru cakap uh kawan dia
uh kawan dia punya husband ke apa atau mungkin kawan dia lah dia ni memang pilot
um dengan apa ni ke apa lah and then after that lost the job and now buat kat macam customer service or something lah
pay but have to still pay for the mortgage and such so ya susah sikit lah
oh so wife dia tak ada job lah
oh tapi dia ada apply ke tak untuk job
ah betul
so dia ada like that has she reached the level whereby like
dia memang dah interview and they've asked her to do a presentation
ada lah but didn't get the job oh wah susah kalau gitu kan lepas everytime kena buat presentation one after the other and then tak dapat job tu
dia kerja dalam what err what sector
oh dalam pun kena retrenchment
wah teruk lepas tu
tapi dia ada err package tak
ada lah then okay lah kalau ada package maybe because dia enam belas tahun dah
oh then okay lah yang tu
orh betul juga
mm betul then dia tak ada commitment
mm betul
ya and freeze hiring kan ya betul juga
bonus pun tak ya bonus pun tak ada
dengar dengar lah dari kawan I memang bonus pun tak ada
ya bukannya the COVID thing has been solved aiyo if we go through another year like that teruk lah macam mana
harap-harap lah kita dapat lebih project macam ini
kalau kita dapat bagus lah kan
mm betul juga
um I nak cakap terima kasih ya joann err sebab hari ni datang rumah I belanja I makan
terima kasih ya so kita tengok lah kalau err minggu ni
weekend nanti kita akan maybe jumpa lagi kat botanical gardens makan breakfast ya
bagus lah
this is gonna be super senang for me
apa okay
ya alah so this is my last semester kan sekarang so
classes that's only like once a week so aku macam like
but it's so much like cause the previous semesters uh I was like so freaking like stressed but now I'm still stressed lah you know sebab sekolah standard but now I feel like
so I was supposed to submit an assignment not assignment lah like a task macam homework yesterday but then like she didn't give me my feedback sought
aku mad ah so I didn't submit
for my time table tak banyak apa punya classes
macam like start at like twelve but like the bad part is balik rumah like lambat so
kau stand out sikit lah
no kau tahu that kind of situation where ada orang wave kat kau and then they're not actually waving at you
so why so kenapa kau mad kat aku for the okay uh huh
so kau fikir yang
you thought like I was giving you some uh attitude gitu lah okay got it
oh kau tengah flex on aku pasal dover dover oof
sometimes I really miss just like being able to like pergi sekolah kau without
I thought kata takde like COVID punya
orh I think confirm like my sekolah mala is like
confirm ah tak halal mala
cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean punya stall aunty dia kata
oh aku dapat apa ada mala and I saw like my malay friend apa apa nama dia uh izzah from izzah is from band remember izzah my
yang tu ya ya ya
pray I was like to allah to count my blessings semua
no I have you eaten there before kau pernah makan
oh ya the daging mahal ya
that time aku makan dengan arlef uh makan mala dekat I think it was last year
the duck rasa lemak dia sedap
your bapa never let you go makan
macam not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one yang at Ichikokudo
to me rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak because aku makan dia punya
the fact that it's garlic dia dah cut
but it was super like lemak for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
ya stomach aku ada problem bro aku tak boleh makan spicy food period
tapi I that time I eh you know oh my god I forgot to tell you about this
no because when you add less of the sauce dia punya flavor
to me untuk aku because Samyang kan uh the normal noodles dia punya calories about five hundred
sebab you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
to me dia nya carbonara dia nya rasa terlampau
almost bukan
dia nya rasa almost bukan Samyang and babe abeh dia punya noodles also not macam
something that aku eat
aku tak makan that kind of stuff
kau makan dia punya cup atau dia punya
no cup atau the packet
oh aku prefer aku think there's a like a
the cup one I feel like it doesn't like kau try makan Samyang cup biasa not even carbonara the texture semua lain what
no kenyal is like err perkataan yang betul
oh you kau tengah looking through universities eh
paolo kat yes correct
oo aku uh dia punya course is uh sciences sosial
kejap eh
oh dorang ada human resource dengan uh itu
passionate tentang human resource
okay aku I I know akan
sound a bit dunia
I don't know tapi sebab
macam aku really nak try pergi overseas ah
aku just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
macam a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm aku looking at western australia nya uni kan kat perth
abeh dia punya fees about thirty eight thousand
tiga puluh lapan ribu uh per tahun
if aku punya is eligible untuk scholarship
abeh accommodation I can stay with my uncle tapi dia punya orang was like betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan uncle kau
ya abeh when she was talking to me dia kata are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea kan untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua
so aku fikir forty thousand extra that's
true sebab aku punya uncle dengan aku punya aunty dorang punya rumah is
quite near to university tau like macam actually dekat
abeh dorang ada banyak bilik spare cause dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin
tapi kalau gitu I have to take a gap year untuk kerja dapat duit
ya abeh kerja kat mana
dah start eh
a'ah betul
dah besar lah
mak dia nak ikut dia pergi overseas
oh mak dia attached to her eh
no but sebab dia dia youngest in the family what so I think it's like expected ah
tapi what I thought you said she's like financially like
tapi her mum let lah is it taking a loan
daphne is the one yang
oh tapi when kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau do you guys talk about pelajaran atau completely like no
oh so your yours are just casual friends ah like bukan competitive
oh korang macam united ah
eh tapi elisa dia nak pergi university mana satu
dorang ada plan
tapi elisa mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak
kerja sana kan
kau tahu tak the main macam
sebab that people nak pergi negeri lain kan is because dorang nak migrate tau
like for example kan aku pergi uh perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go macam for
like uh someone from singapore dorang nak uh apa
belajar kat america boston university
so it's like it's meant to like macam
facilitate dorang untuk keluar negeri kita
so macam like the thing about ambil
I saw this uh tweet pasal this guy they took a hundred thousand loan tak salah aku hundred thousand ke hundred fifty thousand untuk uh go to apa university di america
abeh lepas tu he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary tujuh ribu
so it's like macam the starting pay is a lot what seven thousand is a lot eh
ya I mean if I feel like in negeri america
dorang nya starting pay quite high seh
untuk ah aku punya perspective
no bukan hope it's more of worry macam if aku pergi overseas education what if aku tak boleh bayar balik
right ten year gitu kan
mmhmm abeh ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure aku punya university aku make as much memories as possible
kalau boleh aku nak give it another run lah
not choose my class kau tahu kan time aku masuk poly I actually chose to be in O two
and that time dina was my only friend kawan aku satu jer
so aku was like okay let me just be in the same class as dina but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
I think kalau boleh aerospace sia
but ya so about local university kau nak pergi mana satu and like
not like like course sebab I know kau tak tahu like
uh kau I think I can see you're like interested dalam
bidang uh social services
is it kau punya internship open up your eyes
oh kau tak nak ah
the jutawan di dalam kelas kamu
aku percaya dia ah
oh return of investment gitu eh
um okay investment aku boleh percaya
tapi hundred thousand tu aku tak boleh percaya
oil banyak ah tapi
mana parents dia dapat duit tu untuk start investment in the first place
oh kalau gitu aku macam boleh percaya sikit
ah sikit ah
uh tapi okay lah makes sense tapi ya you were saying dia punya internship
oh kau share tentang internship kau eh
uh huh tu nanti
ya period abeh dia end up kerja di mana
tapi same place tapi online
dia business vibes ah
oh tentang addison rae
aku just I think I'm aku just
dia seorang businesswoman yang sangat gigih
dia jumpa kourtney kardashian
aku rasa kan dia yang paling banyak um
dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira all the time
no no the thing the thing yang aku sedikit marah
eh marah
kau do you know avani
kau pernah nampak videos dia tak
no no no kau pernah nampak video dia tak
dengan james charles eh
no aku rasa the only reason I mean I know you say jangan tengok video dia kalau tak suka kan
tapi the only the thing is I don't think dia deserve all this fame
dia punya ya
aku tengok dia collab dengan james charles tau di YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely sangat bosan as a person like I literally macam couldn't
ya abeh charli d'amelio pun aku rasa she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
ni something yang aku have been thinking about ah serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers kau kata yes ke tak
no aku rasa okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli d'amelio is dia punya latest video dengan maddie ziegler
the dorang buat makeup
dan the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya that itu apa apa aku fikir lah tentang situasi ini
but then again their net worth is like berapa million so aku have nothing on them
oh okay aku faham
cuma aku just uh aku baik dengan dorang aku aku think dorang sangat
dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan stuff like that
tapi I just don't think they deserve this much followers lah
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like macam
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine semua orang dalam uh
phone dorang so
and I think dorang punya it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think dorang deserve all these big opportunities you know
yang uh miniman yang baru eh
oh yang trend baru eh
no I don't aku tak minum Starbucks ah bro
oh kau dapat anxiety macam mana
oh ya malam tu eh
kau that time yang aku minum kopi aku nak pass out kau ingat
ya no is yang I drank the whole cold brew remember
yang kita minum tau it's like that coffee drink
that night yang aku nak pass out sebab aku exercise after that
ya aku nya heart was already like dying aku literally was like
abeh I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like macam complicates things aku literally was like about to pass out
drink coffee at all that time aku minum uh
I didn't like I eat at twelve you know like usual lunch tapi aku belum makan dinner and it was already like six and I was already very hungry no snacks nothing
so I was like hmm mak aku ada instant coffee so aku nak try minum jer lah
so aku minum then after that it was okay
but then I ate dinner at about seven thirty gitu like one hour later
time aku makan dinner suddenly aku rasa macam light not light-headed tau macam
abeh tu semua masa nak pass out terus I had to like stop dinner and like sit and like drink water
ya weird kan aku banyak pass out situations sia
ya tak boleh serious
aku macam aku just don't drink air flavoured ah
uh usually I get the like the like the fruity type macam kat rumah amira that time I drank
aku constantly telling you
Sharetea nya lemak kan rasa dia
it's like sikit tea
like two per cent tea abeh ninety nine per cent milk
dekat Dunkin' kau beli matcha I didn't know what doughnuts you buy but anyways

oh student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means kau manual tak yah naik tak yah itu ke

halloween hari apa
hari ni twenty nine esok
hari sabtu eh sabtu is saturday kan okay period
kenapa bad terms
macam mana amira tahu yang safirah nangis
apa safirah kata
no aku aku macam tak
but aku just feel like safirah do you think safirah overreact atau like she react accordingly
aku just tak suka rafi ah
no macam when I first nampak rafi I knew I I wasn't gonna like him
but most of the time aku punya intuition is right though whenever I have a bad feeling about someone it always happens
wait what other things aku I remember like getting a lot of things right macam regarding all these sus things
but aku feel like aku reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because aku rasa just safirah is like overreacting
ya tak no kejap aku nak explain dengar aku dulu
okay so basically yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan xu shi aku xu shi dengan safirah makan
safirah kan masuk Instagram dia then I was like I told safirah I'm super angry
aku macam nak message dia gitu ah macam just to
say everything ah macam like why you do this to safirah and all abeh safirah was like no
cause she dia tak reply aku tau do you dia reply kau
abeh apa perasaan kau when dia reply
apa perassan kau when safirah replied
apa kau punya fikiran tentang business dari rumah
oh kau suka makan benda manis-manis eh
oh ya doughnuts are nice to me aku suka doughnuts tapi it's like air
aku that time the last time aku makan doughnuts is the Swee Heng aku suka yang that kind of doughnuts
yang sedap yang besar abeh ada chocolate rice kat atas so sedap
ya I feel like Dunkin' Donut nya lagi air airy
kan macam tak tak tak kenyang
oh kau suka complicated flavours ah kira kan
aku just rasa
sedikit sedih ah tentang this situation
safirah needs I told I told my mum about situasi safirah tau about the entire break up
abeh aku macam aku I know safirah dia terlampau serious untuk relationship
kahwin which is good
is bukan perkara yang jahat tau untuk buat gini
tapi aku rasa dia terlampau serious when the guys are literally like
mana macam it's macam tak add up gitu
like dia nak settle down sekarang which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
like when dia message dia kata oh kenapa semua orang atau semua orang masih sekolah
she's nineteen lah I mean like kalau nak kahwin at least twenty three baru find a real like a serious one lah
I feel like it's a bit macam terlampau cepat
my mum my mum said macam you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle macam kau percaya orang ni
abeh last last dia pecah kan hati kau macam gitu jer
ya tapi aku just feel bad ah
then macam do you know about safirah punya parents
no but because like I was also telling my mum like macam my mum said if you come from a stable family
like most likely you won't be out there macam looking for like
no macam like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
that was uh itu yang terjadi kepada irfan apa the first time also
dia punya dorang nya family messed up kan irfan nya
ya eh ni ni skirt yang kau pakai that day eh yang plaid ni
buat kan
sebab dah besar kan
moyang apa ah
damn you saw your moyang
ya you you you kinda like macam jauh
ah how was it mm boleh lah
boleh lah
like um boleh lah macam I didn't expect it to be hard as it is
it's more to macam satisfactory lah unexpectedly good
ya ya ya and then you macam mana
mm sama sama
mm ah understood understood ya cause uh macam for me kan like uh
I don't enjoy anything online at all from ah daripada lectures
really I cannot I feel like um like like very unproductive it's like err no no is is err don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really malas
malas abeh ah tiring lagi so macam
abeh like um macam mana ah your exam punya like err format like how how was it like it's it's online right so macam like how how did it go
leceh ah leceh
oh for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like ah twenty four hours ah so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like huh forty eight hours lama gila
like the questions banyak ke like were there like a lot of questions
no difference tak ada tak ada difference
like why you using serious tak dengar
try ah cakap something
mm cause it sounds like uh err dia macam tak clear sangat so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
sangat what you trying to say ya
blur blur sikit
oh for me kan ah yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was ah twenty four hours tapi like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction tau like the instruction were like very specific so
eleven questions and then lepas tu um the eleven questions tu like ah the marks were different lah for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks ah so like um
ah for like for each question err um my lecturer specified ah like um berapa banyak words
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like um macam ah tak make tak make sense ah cause like err questions two marks jer atau three marks but like uh dia nak
dia nak um the words like limit dia like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
we had to like really um arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like um time consuming lah ah which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like tak tidur cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between ah but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
ya and then then nanti last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like err everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what um like for for me that the twenty four hours uh punya exam it was like macam
uh it was penat ah but then like
but then like uh how do I say this dia macam
my back crying for help and then ya and um like mata sakit and everything so macam err no it's not very like ya it's the worst ah I would say the whole the whole
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think boleh lepas
cause like you know you know there are times like um uh like I I attended like online lectures but then like macam like I was there but I was asleep
ya ya ya serious tak bedek
all okay cause I had this like um ah I ada kelas ni eight thirty tau eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your macam sleeping schedule semua all over the place kan like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late lepastu like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like uh um the what apa nama dia
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link ah I would join lepastu the minute I join and then like right ah terus I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think uh I bukan sorang cause ah when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like macam
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already um not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes ah apa lagi eh online like tak boleh oi
eh tapi lecturers you semua like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some macam trouble juga with certain lecturers
mm faham
most of my lecturers okay lah I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way kan macam if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's semua benda macam very baru untuk semua orang
I think everyone macam masih nak adapting to the whole new situations so it's like uh I I appreciate that uh lecturers I macam they were they were okay lah but then I did have macam trouble dengan some
lecturers ah cause like I don't know why ah tak tahu kenapa ah tapi like I ada satu lecturer ni she was like um
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why ah cause I've I I I don't err I don't macam I tak I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole um the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
um cause it's online kan abeh macam she doesn't
she expects us to err macam
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean faham lah we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so macam it wasn't helpful lah she was expecting us to only come to her only bila kita ada questions so it was like very hard for me like ah apa eh like macam cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just balik singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like macam apa tu the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
ah dia akan cakap ah apa tu
dia akan cakap okay this is the topic we're going to ah this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
on our own so macam I was like ah it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is lah to to understand to faham kan
I I understand that she she wants like kita nya level to be like of really university students tapi macam
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very leceh like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were macam banyak gila benda nak kena like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very leceh and then like
it was very leceh and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause uh uh I had to handle dengan all those um group members who are just useless
working team members which was hard lah cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like macam equally divided kan tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like um malas ah want to layan like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress ah of it but you know some did some did not so it was like ah whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did dorang tak kesah then dorang punya pasal ah
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like ah whatever ah suka hati ah nak buat pape pun boleh lah ya like ya it's like
like apa tu
uh apa nama dia like you know like bila physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
um and then uh like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours ah similar to yours like dorang kasi kita choose um nak apa tu nak individual atau group work so it was like okay lah I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own uh I mean it's kind of scary lah to do be doing assignments like individually tapi macam you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean kan like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so macam settle lah senang kan habis cerita eh but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester
oh dah start dah
ya one class aje okay lah tu
same cause uh for me like I haven't I haven't started sebab mm I baru I baru jer register the class
cause today is a public holiday for malaysia merdeka kan
okay tak
oh pasal apa tu
oh jadi
oh jadi
mm or the like apa tu cerita dia like is it
orh cerita cerita dia like what the whole is it like series eh
series berapa season
I don't I tak suka ah tengok series
I I don't enjoy um like I don't know like maybe sebab macam it's either like I get bored easily atau macam I'm just hard to impress ah cause I will always ah sebab selalu kalau I tengok cerita kan nanti like like if macam dia series
nanti I nak tengok halfway jer
sometimes not even halfway I will just macam ee boring ah malas done dah that's it
especially kalau cerita dia romance kan oh lagi malas no no no tak boleh I I really
ya I macam I mean
sometimes you just you know ah macam just to
just enjoy macam for entertainment macam okay ah but then
ah I would just macam be like err a bit aje ah tapi nanti bila dah get too much nanti I macam ee tak nak tak nak I'm not watching this ah especially if
kalau macam cerita dia very predictive kan no predictive predictable kan so I macam err tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I will just be like okay my last then I'm just I'm gonna finish watching it at all just
move on sebab tu I prefer tengok movies ah daripada like watching like series or like sitcoms or whatever lah you call it
so I'll see lah eh I'll check out and see kalau I managed to watch a good place then I akan bilang you lah
tapi dah habis ke the series is it like done
oh really itu jer ke tak ada cerita lain yang you boleh suggest kat I
um cause uh I when I get like macam betul-betul bored and then I would watch K drama kira like K drama is like the last resort kalau betul-betul dah boring gila then I would watch K dramas
but on a normal like day with like a lot of other things to do no like I'm not the sort lah like macam
uh what I do is macam I would watch rental videos on youtube like really anything like really like suggested stuff right I would I will just watch it macam I picit and just tengok jer
ya I mean just like every like a really a lot of things there kan and macam for me ah macam get bored easily like videos paling lama pun um fifteen twenty minutes dah lah that's it
not like not like macam really lama-lama videos like orang berbual banyak-banyak no no I would just like watch random stuff
if I macam
sometimes I watch like like really random ah like I can be watching macam ah I'll be watching like cooking shows or ya to like macam make-up stuff
or like really like random stuff like people punya like macam room tours or something I don't know I just like really just anything ah
tak tahu ah I macam sometimes tak ada pape pun I will just like
tengok jer check jer it's just like see just see jer like I I'm I do I would I'm not really active lah in terms of like posting stuff ah but I'm very active just being online and like seeing like post by other people lah
not like really really must those people who really post like stories like every day and then like have those like really small dots on their stories tak ah I'm not like that just that I just like enjoy like watching stories of other people then like macam look at other people's posts and then stalk people
not really stalk but like macam look at their profiles and like you know random stuff like really random stuff
like macam
I don't know ah it's just very fun to like read people's like thoughts for me ah macam I really macam enjoy macam baca baca tengok
ya ya ya ya tapi like macam it just makes you like macam talk to yourself like macam eh
like eh interesting eh ah macam you know got those kind of things like is
which like macam I really like ya I mean I really respect those kind of people cause I'm I would say I orang dia I'm very I'm kind of very I very opinionated actually it's just that I don't really express it out openly
ya I mean ya I mean when I do I do ah but I don't do it like all the time like when I really have things to like really express it out I would tapi macam selalunya mm no that's why I really admire people who really can talk about things like especially macam
like you see when like people really like speak up on like uh like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could macam kadang-kadang macam eh like ee I really like like at the back of my head kan macam there were like a lot of things tau I really want to say a lot of things but then like I macam oh like uh
ah uh ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish kadang-kadang I boleh just cakap jer tapi
I I feel that um my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like um follow up on what what's happening kan tapi like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this ah
ya ya ya I mean like for me macam kadang-kadang like I feel I takut kat walaupun
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
huh tapi I I I feel like macam like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited ah tapi you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words kan like you don't want to macam you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like um discussion like a healthy one lah like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like macam very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive ah so macam okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter ah
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say macam go to newspaper ah
sometimes memang mm mm sometimes memang tired ah actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me tapi
penat ah baca dorang nya tweets
I think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like semua orang to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one
oh kalau instagram
tak ah tak tak honestly instagram not really cause like
I follow a lot of people but then like um I get tired of watching stories eventually so I will just like mm I will just like like exit lah when I macam dah malas want to tengok banyak-banyak but some some stories I do enjoy ah but others like when I feel like um macam ee malas pe nak tengok I will be just like
mm mm mm sebab yang the first few ones will always be the one that you always watch right for story ah so macam okay dah tengok ni semua okay dah that's it I don't have to look at everyone's ya cause some people um for me
I feel like I I as much as macam I respect orang lain punya way of using social media sometimes I rasa macam people exposed too much and I don't want to know faham ke
mm like I mean as much as like suka hati lah you nak buat apa dengan you punya instagram tapi sometimes know what they share sometimes buat me uncomfortable so macam I sometimes tak nak tengok ya so I macam okay ya ah
oh cute gila ya cause sometimes they will just like all the um macam celebrity punya anak kan they all like ee geram lah
geram they just really I don't know it's just geram lah
especially those ah I really ah I cannot tak boleh
have you been to like macam uh any weddings like since since phase two
is it yang young counsel eh
pergi dating
letters hantar surat jer
sorry apa
tapi hantar surat like not even
and then jap
dorang hantar surat jer
tak tak like even whatsapp ke I don't know ke like like they don't use like technology form punya like
it's letter right I mean letters macam take time kan untuk like untuk reach the recipients and it's like I mean I feel like dia macam you know orang dulu dulu punya way of like coupling
okay I mean okay ah I think for me right even if you want to keep things like quote unquote macam traditional kan I would at least use email lah you know
you know letters really take a very long time and it's like all the way to medina so macam wow for me I'm I'm very impatient person so macam
like kira macam you know it's like kira macam you have to really
tulis a lot of things you wanted to to really really update you know everything in like one letter then you have to send it all the way
I mean they they macam taking it taking it slow ah
right taking it slow faham faham
macam would you
would you like if macam let's say your parents nak matchmake you would you would you like be open to it
but then okay okay okay okay okay I mean look okay if you were to change the situation kan macam for example
since you cakap you ada someone already like kira you are seeing someone tapi like if you were to change like the whole situation for example um if you are done with your studies kan dah habis belajar then like you not dating anyone
alamak tapi nak cari dekat mana
for okay bila comes to like my love life right I I'm the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe ah so if like from the start if we can't really click then I don't think that that's like hope in it so I will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right mm I think for someone like me it's gonna be hard lah it's gonna be very hard
ah I lebih prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know lah like macam like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which macam I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so macam
so macam I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I tak sure ah whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like ah similar lah to your parents my parents tak macam gitu ah so ya
dorang macam ah cari sendiri they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
um I nak lah tapi you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about ah
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first lah then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like sekarang to have love life like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so um malas lah also like
mm cause like I had like previous like history with like bad breakups so it's like I really malas and tired want to like start again and to to meet someone new no I don't want
ya ya ya malas ah
I really don't want I just macam uh like I would
I would just like I like currently just enjoy that like the apa company of like my friends regardless of gender lah like whatever guy or girl just like enjoy it being friends mm but nothing beyond that I hope
do you have an aim like macam at like age apa umur berapa
I think everyone would think like macam they would get married like after their studies no like everything will be nicely like arranged but right now I'm like
cause like I think to just have degree is not enough so like I feel like I need to like um oh like what do I say how do I say this macam build up build myself up more in terms of education baru macam stable
to have like better jobs and everything kan to have like like a proper stable career then like then then can lah then boleh lah then can lah
dah dah lama kan tak berbual so macam it's really nice we should really jumpa soon you know
ah ah ah betul
but awak awak tak rasa penting family time together to spend time with your family and then weekend tak dapat keluar sama-sama

cause this house was I don't know macam terbakar last time so ada ashes and there was something and then
so maybe the owner ada perempuan and ada a pair of shoes so this person this blogger took that pair of shoes and then put in front of the door
rumah rumah cina I guess
abeh uh huh
the the shoes is the direction is towards a door okay in front of the door so kira the pointy part of the shoes is towards the door lah kan facing the door
then so he go down you know just checking out buat kelakar cause he was scared so he sing along lah
tak handsome ah
mana ada kucing okay lah maybe maybe for us it's like ah he must have edited that lah ha
ya tu kau boleh cakap macam oo who's the one who change the direction okay so so he continued exploring the house
and then err apa
ya cause memang nampak terbakar
tak tahu ah eh
oh okay and then bila macam dia masuk
I think masuk bathroom or kitchen ah I forgot
and then suddenly like tempat tu very panas you know then dia punya tahap panas until there's a smoke come out of nowhere
dia punya fire spark and then tiba-tiba spread all the way dekat lantai so pasal kau human kan kau akan lari apa and then his live was being cut off oh he was doing live ah actually YouTube live
mm ah so he went out the house or room I don't know then dia try to put off the fire back
tak dapat semua ah only sixty percent
yang kat lantai lantai dia uh hilang kan
then bila dia
he saw the thing on fire no the room suddenly sampai
ya you remember that I said the object was like ada smoke coming out
no cause it was during circuit breaker apa
circuit breaker then ramai orang work from home so I was alone in the lab no interns no what
your tempat tinggal
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
apa tu naik one six eight jer
no dia naik one six eight then dia turun dekat jalan kayu kan
mana tahu so it's like a a palm thing sized eh
he kerja malam
kalau aku aku dah keluar seh
kurang ajar seh orang macam gitu ee
tak mahu hidup please
orang tengah kesusahan kau tak tolong eh
kurang ajar sia
today malam ah
is for orang yang buat korban kan not us
perempuan I'm not sure usually lelaki
I mean kalau kau baligh I guess I don't know
kau import
I think they will but restricted takde viewers viewers eh whatever ah ah ah ya ya
go masjid doesn't mean I always do korban what you think I'm that rich ah
no lah aiyo I don't even eat kambing
no ah only eat biryani and tulang merah
that's the only kambing that I eat
actually pada aku tak ah it depends on how you cook actually
no that's why aku very selective with like orang masak kambing kan aku tengok reviews dulu
err so far aku rasa biryani masjid jer yang sedap
you know yang yang kat sekolah kita yes tu from one of the mosques ah I don't know
it's like for four people to eat it in fact sikit jer cause they say girls always waste food
I mean don't blame us ah we finished it clean seh kita minta dua tiga kali
tu pasal seh
eh you are still growing takpe lah
I don't know korang kira the the high ah
tapi kau pernah pakai yang very tall what
ah yang penting aku tak kan
aku pernah pakai flats uh fifty which is what five no wait to
so perempuan eh
uh eh five tinggi tau
kau pernah pakai that time
siapa eh siapa nama dia fatin fatin nadirah
ah tu semua takde
no lah cause sec one aku tahu
then semua orang macam tak nak join dorang punya group so thirteen me cause I was unhappy with mumtaz then I asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then I kept eh you all want to join me kita book kita sewa bus then macam okay okay ah okay lor
aku ingat lah kau ni sec one sec one sec one aku ingat
no they were with dorang ah
ya I mean you keep blaming when like kita orang not everyone you know there's only like a group of people yang cari pasal dengan kau
actually understandable ah cause we were talking about class there what tak nak kawan macam
ah macam tersisih gitu
okay dah eh dah habis eh
but kena force take everything back
I don't want to take private okay aku tak nak stereotype ah but you look at the people who take private O level
tebalkan muka ah
and apparently I I was the only one yang retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back malu I guess so ya lah tapi ustazah siapa masniah tak salah
ah dia kata dengan aku apa kalau awak nak retake awak kena ambil fully dengan arab arab sekali semua aku macam eh serious ah ustazah

previous seniors ah like they retake tapi they are exempted from

yo how how does it feel when you just broke up and then like eh kau tahu dia macam gini kat aku kat aku macam ya allah
sec two sec three ah but like after dia ni pe
kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit lah
like clearly everyone the whole school is talking about you you know like eh sudah lah I don't have time for all of you
eh tak cause okay cause my relationship was low-key relationship kan of course ah I don't want to expelled what
no maksud aku at that moment
that's different maksud aku low-key is like
ya okay maksud aku low-key kan that time was like cikgu-cikgu tak tahu part ni tak keluar tak heboh-heboh
so actually tak ramai orang tahu that I was in a relationship with him we study ah whenever we sit in the circle you know ah our our own things sit in circle then talk about then like eh amin like shafwa is it amin like shafwa right eh but I know shafwa like amin ah they always go out together aku dah macam
camne nak cakap eh aku jer asyik put in effort ah for me lah that's what I see ah don't know about him maybe he said like I put in effort too then macam ya lah
sebab tu buat aku penat ah
so okay pada aku really shafwa is just the reason

um and eh nak join tak muay thai gym together
everyday you pergi
no limitation and there's going to be like macam coach
um they are gonna be there macam ada certain slots certain coaches ah
tak tu tu lah soalan cepumas dia saya tak tahu boleh ke tak tapi kita cuba kita tak tahu
if you know how to might manage your time macam okay one day badminton then one day
gini but evolve is just
I usually run um macam about
kind of everyday but just like weekends kadang-kadang macam rest penat sangat kan
two K two K plus pun jadi seh
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know dekat um
kasi lah you know chance sikit kan tutup mata satu kan and just orh come
without any experiences in training will be provided kan boleh pe and
training apa internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much ah honestly
kan susah nak dapat company yang you know really
like baca buku about homework
so like you're contradicting yourself macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa but then
there was oh kena buat assessments lah apa lah
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused yang budak-budak ni kesian kan dah balik sekolah penat
talk at all you masuk bilik
start belajar
and tak boleh baca buku
sampai habis assessment book
for their well-being macam okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them macam shelter but
okay lah kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu
nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh tau
kalau rest pun ten minute
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high ah maybe because of that you know kids complain macam eh penat you know I don't want to go student care anymore
quitting lah actually like one month macam about seven
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit macam you know sit like
they fold their legs fold pun tak boleh
yes they have to sit macam you know upright sit properly
you know our own choices macam budak-budak ni like kesian kan semua benda kena
so dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know you know
she dah dah dah dah dah ada suami so lupa lah
tak telephone tak apa
dapat and okay kahwin and like
dan you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
jodoh semua ni susah lah I mean like but
the day I get to eat some nasi biryani
nasi minyak please come on bila ni
macam like I don't know I I will learn from it lah
macam they will get like a set of rules
macam it's kind of unfair
macam takut tau okay you know like they say macam when you
when you buy buang air kecil kan then like there's ends
how to say macam
in my family punya history
ada okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my grandpa macam semua ada this history of
don't you takut seh say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
takut lah I mean like I have to take care of my diet lah
so I am like oh okay jap white bread is high
okay macam
insulin tak pakai banyak even insulin is working perfectly
that's the thing kuah lemak apa ah cholesterol oh my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
dekat kedai ada ke jual salad like hawker centre
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce kita beli like ten dollar but then
that's true beli like banyak then after that simpan in the fridge
this is the thing ah macam
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition nak physically active lah abeh busy lah dengan kerja
nutritionist exist to macam lead them
itu semua pakai duit seh do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
err love pun susah dapat like
that's true and parents nowadays also working abeh balik dah tidur you know that kind of thing
and ya lah it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend gi mana
we lepak dengan kawan but I mean it's not wrong but okay lah macam
ada balance lah okay one day with your parents one day oh I've heard of this story before satu okay there's this one um student right
um makcik tinggalkan
ah abandoned him dekat bus stop dekat malaysia
ah dia tinggalkan ah dia letak bag suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa ah
cakap um bapa nak balik you know that kind of thing and the son also tak cari bapa dia for one month
and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home
ya that's true macam you know
maybe the financially dorang tak boleh handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays banyak macam drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in macam oh ni ya allah tak baik seh
the kids now the kids ada sekarang trauma issues
ya lah they've taken care of me well apa kecil-kecil kasi makan this a way for us to repay back
that's true macam it it
um doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia punya chances
um lepak or relaxing at her old age
bosan seh duduk dekat rumah you know like the whole thing like
I don't know macam singapore
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only ni semua nak merebut lah but then
you know if you really want to chill chill mango pergi dekat paris
just duduk minum kopi and you
ada pros and cons juga fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent macam economy wah jangan cakap ah
lepak sikit lah
you know the population pun sekarang macam a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
I mean rezeki tu okay lah there's rezeki tu datang dari very you know
makan pun berapa dah berapa dollar okay nak beli pampers nak beli ini and
to me macam house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid lah I've never been living with a maid before macam sedap kan ada orang kemaskan you and all that
go macam okay err go with the flow macam go with the flow sangat you know
okay to me macam one year gap is quite productive leh like you just take one year to just
momentum dah hilang tau hilang graduate
abeh dah tak belajar eh
macam shiok dah naik shiok
so macam if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
may I I graduated kirakan macam april lah eh dah habiskan
till november terus start kerja
so better lah aim for it and there's a lot of my friends yang
the punya
so minor I mean you can minor in apa organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
oh betul betul betul
I mean depends ah on the situation kalau nak job hop just because oh you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not macam you're still young you need to know what you really want in life kalau tak experience macam mana seh
progress betul-betul macam you know be successful
oh my god that is ridiculous okay merepek gila
macam we are barely okay
like with so many macam experience and really capable
takkan nak sama okay over generous everyone as the same
don't over expect too much and also don't macam
you know like letak kita kat bawah sangat you know macam
dorang macam eh korang ni tak ada apa-apa ah just nothing you know
middle lah macam
that's true macam like
I always watch like movies you know macam
and macam susah lah dapat
macam america ni semua
sometimes I do have thoughts macam if we want to be like
apa ni is stranger things
a decent self control punya tolerance but me
like once I'm indulge into that kan habis
it's over for me so I tend I tend to macam you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like muay thai gym
for I usually waste money on play nation ni semua
tapi waste of money lah so I stop playing games
switch is simple kau macam you can bring it around pastu boleh main
baju ni semua but I'm trying my best not to
I see eh wait where does he where macam mana dia invest
tak sikit kan that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just kasi macam hundred seventy gitu
and for fifteen years ah then macam ada you will get back like a lump sum
um and in case if you were to macam touch wood lah macam pass away or anything like
how to get ah macam
you know these thing which are the backup plan gitu
what do you mean by anak luar nikah
oh tak tak tak macam serious macam in love gitu abeh uh dorang macam eh aku nak kahwin ngan kau ah because like I know I feel like I'm ready for this marriage abeh like um you know the
the parents macam oh you too young you know why why you want to get married so young you know and then they are like no I want to get married now now now what do you think
haram lah like that
okay so it's like err kes macam err okay scenario ah it's like err
they halalkan like that ah
macam apa mm macam nak date other chicks or what
I think I think by the fourth year ah aku dah settle down sia aku dah macam damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me ah by the third or fourth year ah it will give me like a sense of macam
ah that's the thing lah because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling abeh tak stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot kita masih takde
like tak ready because of money ya
tu lah
tapi honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like err
they don't want both of us to macam sekolah halfway sekolah halfway then after that err drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support ah to support each other or like err
I don't want to commit anymore sins eh and it's not that err macam bukan aku yang tanggung fully tau is like my parents around who has to tanggung for my sins also so it's like aiya I don't know lah susah I don't mind getting married now
macam I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
err friends yang macam ah don't want ah I I need money I need money like err aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup and I'm like but money is not everything what you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know ah macam entah
macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur ah
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal tak takde orang yang macam marah marah you know kat singapore macam
semua orang nak boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport semua orang macam oh alamak aku kena masuk
entah when I was still
correct eh okay lah jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small ambil macam the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular apa the population ah yes is so dense and like there's this
actually a lot of people want to err masuk singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and kita macam number one tau tip top tau
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that bila spain kena dia cepat cepat balik ke singapore
macam kalau kau sakit ke apa kan ada disease siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang singapore singapore can like handle it you know
donation like that okay and then like err a lot of children from asia kind of thing dorang macam err
suburbs is like farm area macam all the rural ah ah ah like rural area like people
I remember dekat punggol macam everything must empty takde barang you know there was a a lot of land yang kita boleh pakai
and then kita macam
you know last time I err we go pancing tau
pancing dekat macam illegal places
eh aku pancing lah
err how to say ah macam hutan-hutan oh begitu kita pergi kita drive dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah random
serious tak joke ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni confirm dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik confirm tahu punya
so err I think kita pancing ah but then after that I think the government know about it lah so no choice right err they I think they close macam a lot of the places ah and then err kita the only place kita boleh pergi is
flats because population kita kan makin besar
kita ah foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then err apa singapore pun is a district for business tau kau tahu like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground macam
si kim jong-un datang kat singapore dengan si donald tu kan dorang datang ke sini cause we are neutral
ah aku ingat aku ingat the apa banyak macam sibuk kat shangri-la tapi semua orang macam ee I want to see liao ah that kind of thing
eh singapore ambil kesempatan eh but it's good err apanya rasa publicity
ya it was good publicity for us ya sebab wah terus semua orang macam wah tengok oi singapore lawanya shangri-la wah macam semua nak pergi kan
tapi err I err aku rasa ramai orang ada misconception especially after rich crazy apa
eh I think after that that one right so many people macam got to know about singapore kan because they mentioned in singapore banyak kali tu
but the funny thing was apparently there are rumours yang cakap rumah tu bukan kat singapore
rumah tu some of it was filmed in malaysia
okay aku tak pernah tengok sorry ah
serious no joke aku tak pernah tengok
I don't know I felt like it was just too hard cam am I right macam and it's

alamak takde chance lah
banyak okay K
that time aku kat rumah abah aku then he say uh he ask me ah eh do you want to watch mulan or not then I say
but people say don't support mulan then but then I do want to watch lah macam
tapi I want to see if the cinematic is good or not so
so aku macam okay ah maybe just watch but I didn't really pay attention to it ah
I was not fully there but I watch macam sepuluh minit lepas tu chao
and then after that I came back I oh okay so this is the scene ah ah ah oh ni scene dia abeh apa dah jadi uh oh ya so I didn't really focus but I kind of know macam dia punya jalan cerita
ya why kau dah tengok oo on the cinema
oh apa dragon tu mushu eh
aku sedih bila mushu takde because that was that played a very important role you seh
alamak aku tak ingat [ah]
tapi it changes everything seh like the jalan cerita is not there anymore what
I remember seeing that one the the guys macam fooling around mandi
the mandi part I saw that one
ketawa sial like apa jer K but anyway then aku ingat bila
cause yang lagu dia it keeps playing that's all everytime I watch the music keep playing sia then I was like what is this leh why why the like in the real cartoon got so many songs you know everybody's happy
but then this one it's like keep playing reflection reflection reflection sini reflection sana abeh
alamak ku tak dengar
speaking of movies when was the last time you pergi cinema
kita pergi tengok cerita alamak I forget what was the movie called err
it was like err X-men punya series ah
ya macam this group of kids with super mutants ah new mutants ya
ajak aku then K lah
eh aku tengok ah sia
tak semua ah aku tahu the first one
no not the first one lah the first one is normal apa yang dorang
ah apocalypse aku tengok
back to the future dah aku tengok
aku tahu yang err
err yang the first one the first one ya normal kan the second one is the dorang balik right flashback kan the third one is
ah ah si jean tu
mm wolverine tiga ah tiga
bila semua cinema semua busak busak pula buka bila cinema buka
baru err it was one of the movies that was being released together
takde lah when no lah after COVID bah
eh after COVID eh macam COVID dah habis juga
the there's the scooby doo new movie yang macam merepek ah honestly
eh tapi yang the one that I was the the one I was so disappointed eh was a quiet place
aku macam siala
sakit hati tak dapat tengok it's not released
ya abeh dorang semua orang dah get ready ah I think it was
aku dengar bila but it was going to be released
sekali when the government announce yang the circuit breaker period kan lepas tu dorang macam sorry cancel lah ni semua ni semua and it was like a couple of weeks maybe two or three weeks
aku sedih sia I was like walao so close
tapi boring ah bila kat cinema we were separated see and we were three people
so I was like macam mana ni then kita okay lah terpaksa lah I just ask uh apa
I mean like it's okay what I just because I also don't have any interest right in this movie sorry sorry apa
okay maju cari online ah
macam okay they needed this staff to jaga the cinema halls and they needed this staff to save entry then they needed counter staff
but now they change seh they change to err counter err satu orang so the counter will take all your orders macam kau nak tiket ni you want some drinks okay uh when you pay already there's this like queueing system macam McDonald's
so apa ni
so kita tunggu lah macam McDonald's begitu
even at Timezone tu kali aku pergi
ya aku pergi Timezone
eh Timezone bes seh but anyway I went to Timezone also
ya true makan duit a lot
uh same lah like they just kesian aku tengok a lot of people do a lot work seh then macam to me it's extra work ah
oof kenapa pula
ya sia eh speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught lagi like
but ya lah I I think you brought up a good point seh like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle yang tak take so much of your time ah then maybe can ah
macam what
like eh walao I'll be angry seh if I have no social life boleh mati sia
oi susah sia
okay the time or money eh okay kalau if let's say I am married lah
ah that's why that's why I say money is tak not so bad ah it can be a choice ah
I think being in singapore macam very I think just singapore lah ya
keeping it to macam singapore punya contexts ah
oh tu lagi ugh
although I have to say that macam uh
like that one that one can say that the government is trying to improve because err there are more ministers talking about it and macam a lot of people are more open to listening and like they don't just macam categorising as orang gila you know that kind of thing
that one rabak seh semua orang macam ah ni confirm stress jer
tak mau sensitive seh ya tapi ya lah err I think it's
have you heard of this macam disorder called multiple multiple
apa I forgot ah split personality gitu macam
gitu split is the one ya kau pernah dengar
aku pun tak tahu sia
uh okay I had actually aku tengok this YouTube video tau err this this there's this girl lah aku tak tahu ah
err then dia macam tunjuk tau macam mana dia punya
disorder macam dia punya err how like she just teach more about her itu [ah] her her macam mental health I guess
you know it's not mental health is just the disorder lah eh dia punya diagnosis ya
and then dia tunjuk tau macam mana like she changes from one person to another person that kind of thing
wow I didn't know such like wah seriously macam ee aku tak pernah nampak sial gini ya because of internet ah ya basically things from the internet eh macam exposure seh
ah ah macam recommended
yes that's the okay honestly when aku first heard of it eh I was like
what ya ya eh apa sial this is this seriously macam for real I've never heard of this sia
and I was so shocked by the err apa personalities that was in that girl you know
okay dengarnya ni alters
ya tak betul not not really tak betul but macam split kan macam banyak power
okay they will get strong tiba-tiba all that right
ah tapi tapi dia ceritakan as much as it is an exposure to this disorder it also portrays a little bit uh macam fictional of the disorder macam bilik
so ya you should watch it you know ah that girl I forget I know her YouTube is dissociate did or something like that kau tahu anthony padilla the YouTuber
anthony padilla ada ah kat YouTube ah then he he did that the interview
ya then uh he interview ah the girl then the girl show got this budak kecil inside her body eh ya then budak tu kecil tu keluar tau
as each alter has their own um role macam there's the protector
ah there's the protector there's a apa mediator there's the child and all that so
aku tak tengok movie dia actually
tapi aku tahu pasal movie dia
macam err like like those scars lah like that
macam superhero right right right they had a motive right together
uh I feel like uh apa ni the movie is good exposure lah
eh I mean is rare to to see all these kind of people like I've never met somebody in singapore ah actually tak pernah aku nampak dorang macam begini ya
mm three wishes eh okay firstly I rasa I nak jadi billionaire
jadi billionaire I feel secure
can actually solve a lot of problem macam if like in case of emergencies like
macam accident ke apa I have the money already
I can like feel rich you know like macam jalan sana jalan sini eh I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
so I want my own transport and rumah
so like what you asked right I rasa transport I nak motor ke kereta ke
I nak my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
tak payah nak tunggu flights pun
like I want to go here and there I can macam eh sembarang eh aku nak flight okay aku naik aku punya private jet that kind of thing
like also kan macam bawa orang lah like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam you know sekarang kita nak naik plane pun nak kena bayar for the air ticket right
have the private jet why not I just macam families let's go like I can
I can payung you guys for
transportation ah eh tapi duit belanja tak
I want to conquer a lot of language so macam
ada skill like that kan
like what's you skill oh I can speak a lot of language gitu macam but I want to speak like the common one lah macam mandarin uh korean it's like
common sekarang then
kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam nice right like
since it's a wish right dia macam bukan macam magic gitu kan kalau magic gitu kan
eh sudah aku nak letak magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need lah tak payah
you know about yang seratus dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
or like amusement park ah all that ada tourism
you want to picnic ke nak overnight
rather than macam
kalau dia dua ratus lebih then
you can only use your your own only kan abeh bayar seratus lebih gila
maybe we can picnic ke apa right what you said picnic then kalau kita picnic pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak
macam hotel then chalet ke apa kan untuk staycation gitu kan mm actually not bad ah I think the idea is not bad abeh kita boleh barbecue lagi kan kalau kalau kita macam
chalet ke ah kalau macam chalet tu boleh barbecue pe
and then macam rumah okay rumah maybe like macam if it's like four hundred we can just
so it's like satu orang like berapa berapa puluh dollar gitu or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars gitu
untuk makan dengan minum okay ah nice then we can just cook or we can like macam chalet or what we tempat dia boleh masak kan so
we can just buy our groceries ke apa
then we macam simpan dalam fridge then esok tu breakfast boleh masak
semua then
I think by lunch gitu we need to
because right takkan kita nak buat macam so called birthday party tak ada decoration ke apa kan
I mean we can buy macam dekat daiso ke apa kan so dua dollar dua dollar murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat neighbourhood kind of shop kan
so I'm not sure if kalau mm but it's a nice idea lah to macam
buat both
because we can macam save up a bit of money rather than macam
satu birthday party lepas tu birthday party lagi habis duit then
tu confirm confirm kena bayar lagi eh service tu
nice but I don't think macam I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own macam
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation macam like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
we should use chalet or something rather than that because macam
kalau ada rules or regulations susah ah kita pun nak buat macam we want to save
cause sekali tak save eh uh government pula
ah ya lah like some agency datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih eh
err macam
ada rooftop like that ah
not not really rooftop dia macam not rooftop or shelter tapi macam indoor sikit
ah we can we can find the place around there so kalau hujan ke apa kan kita tak kena
because marina west coast east coast tu semua is all
so kalau hujan ke apa we still boleh lepak depan situ
for a picnic with my friends we actually macam
abeh okay maybe kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita pack up sudah hujan lebat kan
because it's like alah sikit-sikit jer point point point
gitu jer kan
I mean we got the what is called ah yang besar tu parasol eh
ah yang payung besar tu
we brought that also so kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ we letak so
ah macam ada what is it macam terpercik eh is it terpercik macam hujan kena
if we macam takut hujan splash on us then we put the uh the payung besar
mm even though we under the macam cover kan but still lah we just
kita tak kena ah pasal kita letak payung besar tu
macam glamping is it dia macam wait ah
I don't think dia orang akan macam
err kau nak stay pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu I don't think
I think that's good though but rather than macam we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
err take macam morning like that no we should like macam petang petang gitu
we should rent from petang petang
sampai ke malam like that so sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu ya we should rent that kind
so that macam
but I I don't know kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu skate macam you don't know how to skate kan
abeh kalau aku roller blade sorang eh sedih sia aku orang semua cycle cycle cycle aku eh roller blade dengan aku
oh I remember that time my eh my cousin our cousin our cousin said nak pergi zoo
merepek pergi zoo pergi zoo tengok binatang jer
both of us we don't really like animals macam hey kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok jer binatang tu
maybe aku tak appreciate ah but
I seriously want that instead of macam pergi to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
gila I will just research about it later lepas tu nanti kita tengok
cause I felt like kita macam tak spend banyak time
yang macam cousins we don't really have much
I'm like I'm schooling all that macam all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to macam jalan-jalan together
we can actually macam save up a bit of money ke apa eh lepas tu pergi shopping ke
macam nice right
ya tak berapa lama kita plan eh picnic pe picnic engkau dah dua tiga tahun
I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
I mean I'm okay with it cause it looks it looks nice the one I just googled just now it looks really nice and I felt like macam
eh macam best jer tempat ah gitu
if I'm not wrong kallang ada
mm tempat stadium tu
I mean kalau hujan ke apa kau tetap boleh climb apa
sama lah aku goal tahun ni
nak healthy lifestyle
healthy ke benda jogging tidak malam siap kerja makan
oh but talking about tu you know just now eh just now mampus you know that time
I wanted to try dia punya rock climbing
cause I rasa macam eh long time seh tak rock climbing why not eh
malu ah kalau jatuh ke apa eh orang keliling nampak dah lah rock climbing dia dekat tengah-tengah dunia gitu eh
embarrassment lah lol kat kallang wave tu kan
we can also macam watch movie also dengan dia orang
eh do you do you think the one that you suggest ada ke apa boleh kita tengok cerita lepas tu
makan makan berbual berbual lepas tu lepak-lepak eh
tak payah ah buang duit ah
I thought this one dia orang dah sediakan tempat tak ke
they sediakan already right they they have their own designated punya tempat pe
so I cakap lepas tu kan like what you say lepas tu kita cycle kan so pagi-pagi boleh cycle pe
dah cycle kita pergi mcdonald's ke
ha gitu kita pergi makan breakfast because we only bring makan untuk dinner dengan yang so called small celebration tu
then morning cycle cycle tu semua beli makan breakfast tu semua then after that
if they want to play at the seawater suka hati ah kan
I thought of like I don't know if I should bring my guitar or not but then macam
chey minah melayu sangat ni if I bring guitar and then
and then you play guitar macam eh macam dalam drama eh
but nice and then we can like macam take video photos
it's either kita macam nak balik rumah ke kita macam nak continue to other place ke apa not bad ah
tak payah nasi ah merepek picnic picnic nasi nonsense
no lah but since it's picnic I already know lah takkan I nak tu buang ni
nice if kita since kita nak buat macam birthday party celebration that kind kan
we could have just bihun goreng and nasi goreng eh sedap
is it kita nak potluck gitu
kita bawa makan dia orang bawa air ah kita suruh cousin kita bawa air
ice since dia orang nearer ask them to buy ice cube also ah
huh cucuk what
gila kalau semua benda kita dua jer yang buat
ya that's why I say dengan kita dua nak buat macam macam jangan buat kelakar
you know you talk about macam letak dekat skewer gitu kan
instead of letak kat skewer tu kan then we can just buy you know yang macam selalu orang barbecue ke
orang birthday party ke apa yang besar tu
ah so we put everything kat situ
ya lah so mi dengan nasi letak dekat situ tapi yang macam nugget ke ayam ke crabstick cuma
tak payah letak belakang lah
but I think we can do macam benda lain I mean
I I thought of like macam
buat roti sandwich or
or apa eh tu nama
I mean you say macam tak nak everything fried fried what then macam tu semua I mean it's easy to do but
whatever lah I mean tengok jer lah if if I feel like doing it ya I will do it
mm actually okay ah boleh ah one one dish jer ah lepas tu kita buat yang you know
uh we buy it's either we buy or we just find yang besar gila punya tupperware tu kita buat yang
buat satu jer lah tak payah buat dua gila kata
goreng goreng ni sambal goreng pula lagi tak payah lah
boleh boleh actually not bad can
air I think air
we are going to like have birthday celebration ni semua from
today to the next day what so of course kita perlu air pe
now like that I want like macam then we half half ah macam one is the normal drinks then uh macam
half is normal drink half is err carbonated one so macam sedap ada orang nak ada air sedap
oren oren carbonated
ya because he say it's better to just buy there lepas tu pergi pe pasal murah pe belakang
boleh lah beli a bit of chips chips yang kita nak okay maybe the chips that they buy is not the one that we want or we can just discuss what kind of chips that we want ah
but then even after we discussing obviously we need to buy the one that macam semua makan pe
so macam if you like macam like me
I sometimes feel macam oh without this I cannot sia I need this snack ah macam gitu eh
so so so I think that one nak kena beli sendiri ah
then mi oh I think oh ya I think we also need to ask
I don't know mi hoon goreng ke
mi goreng kuning ke okay ah anything can
I thought you cooking the nasi goreng
nasi goreng cina sedap eh
you masak nasi goreng cina tapi you campak ikan bilis
I help you potong ayam
okay lah boleh boleh ask your husband lah
dua packet untuk ramai orang memang tak cukup
tapi kalau kau letak sayur macam dia dah macam-macam pinggan like that what macam bowl
okay then like that takpe kita suruh dia orang buat sandwich tapi dia macam gini
lepas tu uh the tuna
ya ya what I mean dia punya roti
roti dia kalau ada crust suruh dia orang potong crust dia
lepas tu crust dia we put inside one of the plastic and then kita boleh buat
roti gula ke apa with the crust
the crust is very easy to do what setakat
crust tu kita setakat uh letak
so that it's easier so and then you can uh apa tu masuk dalam air fryer
masuk dalam air fryer lepas tu you jadikan macam snack keras keras sikit gitu
then you can just make roti snack or you don't need to
uh apa tu you don't need to air fryer or what
ya I like mushroom ball so we buy mushroom ball and instead of fishball and then nugget dengan fried chicken right
terlebih fries nanti soggy
okay ah I think we cun cun nice already ah everything we plan is nice already so I think we can tell them
instead of the one that we want to staycation tak payah lah buang duit lah
kalau kalau glamping tu mahal sangat
kita lepak kat tepi beach tu jer
letak mat kat situ ah lepak jer kat tepi okay ah
nice plan we both of us plan is like cun already
we want to go out picnic we tell them already what so but then kita kata maybe kita should go next year
during kak nadiah punya birthday dengan sambung together with abang punya birthday
we just said that but we never say about macam kita punya surprise birthday party what so okay ah dia orang pun tak tahu
they need because I think like macam whatever they like ah or need
cause I feel macam
okay lah then that one we can bring dia punya husband or something you know or someone else or adik dia
we can bring to buy to pillih dia punya dress ke apa because
kita punya taste tak ada lah sama sangat
oh ya so I don't know if we should buy denim sebab denim mahal
so tak tahu ah kalau kita nak beli denim beli denim kalau nak beli dress beli dress
colour code untuk kita waktu kita pergi picnic yes
since kita
since kita pun nak overnight right so kita colour code dua hari ah
but tak nak black ah common
I want red actually but I felt like kalau hujan macam mana
petir guruh ke apa ow aku takut
takpe ah suruh dia pakai baju kat dalam lepas tu yang tu tak payah butang
tu I don't know ah but we can just discuss with them later since we already discuss everything
so the colour coding later we can just ask kau orang ada colour apa kita ada colour apa ah
all right okay jadi yang abang guide to grabfood ni
tahu tahu tahu tahu and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that kind of serious macam like
ni waktu bila like april eh april may
oh abang grabfood
damn boleh tahan juga ah oh my goodness
so like dia tak not to worry lah
tak layan lah dia biarkan jer
so kau habis kau cakap apa
okay kot
wah fan service fan service habis
oh macam ni zan itu budak ini
yikes oh but he dia deliver like which area
oh dekat ah
his route oh okay tempat lepak literally
okay tahu tahu tahu
tahu tahu I know that one
ah tu lah
too and and and then they dia orang like buat videos yang can make you pause for a while and like oh I'll double tap that
entah aku tak tahu but we'll find out soon
so like um like you're not you know that that meme yang the person is like um like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see maknanya kiss kiss my teeth
like once you respond habis that's it mm
I do it you know I've got come my adik I do it at nasha when I ask her to like get me something
I am a minah at heart
it's six o'clock that's it I tutup my laptop I roll over to my bed and I buka tiktok
and she was like you tak nak makan eh and I was like oh right dinner I totally forgot
today I learn so macam like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say oh that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first I I thought it was like the musically yang bodoh punya
ya betul betul betul
yes yes and we know that musically dengan vine tu semua budak kecil
yes like the budak mana from clementi tengah buat dancing
eh how long have you been going for the uh apa afro ah afro class
so for physical classes macam dia orang kasih berapa orang datang
stamina dah turun
rentak and all
I guess I guess that's the stereotype lah kalau macam malay dance instructor confirm zumba
you lose our pintu tak ada lah
then pakai lagu-lagu seventeen seventeen is known for their very sharp um dances
it's ayam juga
ah it's okay sis dah malam kan dah pukul sembilan fifty fifty
oh my god aku ingat kau dah ada dua phone ni I'm a businesswoman ke
how okay in the first place macam mana kau nak focus I I'm I just
you know what I mean ya to each it's own I trust you I know like if you say suara sedap mesti suara sedap kan
ha tu lah I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff anime you probably won't go the other way
um it's more slice of life I guess um so I guess I prefer that kind rather than macam like actually the things I remember watching
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so macam for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers kalau dia tak pakai kan nanti dia bangun pagi kan terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
it's so merepek but it's so good it's so kelakar gila like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch ah saiki it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I rasa belum habis
like I've started two three weeks ago I rasa belum habis
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time tak habis-habis tau I'm like bila ni
aku tak tahu ada berapa season berapa banyak episode I'm still with season two tau season freaking two
oh yang total aku tak tahu aku belum I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that lah cause I guess I can relate to it more macam shonen is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
even this one tak masuk akal pun at least I I can relate
I I actually um because I brought home najhah's punya um haikyu jacket and
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite berisi juga like she's not stick thin
plus it's like her favourite show so I tak nak hampakan lah
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like oh my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask kak zan and kak najhah you jangan macam gini eh
some how are some people are just really ridiculous tau merepek gila tau dia punya perangai and then after awhile I realized that for
ha tu lah
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like eh sixteen where you want to find online macam mana cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
jesse mccartney no lah that's a singer merepek jer sampai jer kutuk aku bukan
tu lah uh tak boleh haram
ah biasa okay lah bagus lah apa apa lah shah
ah tu lah oh my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like tunduk to the husband
you should just have said tiga so
kau datang dari drama mana ni
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched nur
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this um new ustaz baru graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
who has his own um tahfiz school and his own masjid
and then one day while he was giving the ceramah subuh thank god he he
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people um and it's really weird because
ha dia orang Q&A tak pernah dengar kan
ada Q&A session uh the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version masjid version
bila keluar masjid then dia nampak this kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis on a white piece of paper
he was macam ya like wow
so but like more in depth lah so like for him like want to provoking macam hati dia macam dup dup
uh kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni
everywhere like dia punya dekat jalan and they met and they dated
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she tergesa-gesa but the she just
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's tak masuk akal the level of patients and the
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was cinta si wedding planner
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then kat rumah and she's about to sleep and she's wearing tudung
or she's sleeping in her tudung
or like maybe not the not the you know the nenek-nenek kind
ha tu lah
coffee apa starbucks
cause kita dekat dengan bugis kan kita boleh pergi haji lane like haji lane okay for example yang macam kalau kau nak makan makanan melayu semua
macam zamzam ada ataupun err ah ramen stall dim sum place also that time I went ramen stall quite nice ah
sedap sia nak try ya it's apa tu okay lah
I feel like kita reserve reservation punya tempat jer ah through online aku buat
orh then kau last minute rush ah
yang tadi kau punya kawan semua ah okay
uh huh eh how come orh it's the presentation eh tadi but how come your works kena collected
mm ya correct correct correct ya you make the final uh apa tu big change ah
because like kau fikir banyak sangat then after that like at the end of the day you know macam this thing happen like you tak expect what
you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know pada kau because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like oh dia macam it's their first time seeing it ah so they will either like it or not like it ah so if it if they like it means it's good lah
apa tu what they say about your works semua like during the presentation
no fine arts ah aku lain kan mm uh huh
mm orh maybe macam I feel like the concept doesn't really
entah eh
kau punya asal like okay kau lecturer berapa banyak dalam presentation room
fever and dengue dia rabak eh chronic eh but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct oh okay so only one presentation ah bagus sia
aku dua presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself macam tiga lecturer yang kita ada
and then like uh week sixteen is another lecture that we tak kenal ya so it's like uh brand new face that see macam because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer kita kan everyday nampak kan so like they bring this another lecturer then from there terus but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like err that one I can say uh make or break ah
ya but the adjunct lecturers semua baik gila ya
pe processor ya entah lah that what name ya
cause last sem really it's rabak eh and I feel ya entah maybe because pasal like
entah eh I feel like last year was their year macam shu dengan like eden I feel like this year it's like me and effy punya ya their they are so rabak oi ah ya last term last term
mm honestly aku
mmhmm orh it's your own major right ya ya kita every sem tukar kelas ya but fuck
because like honestly I thought this sem kita akan tukar kelas lagi but then me and effy macam alamak kita geram gila ah
you know we still in the same class tapi macam okay how it goes right that
sama class so everyone in sama class ah so basically its like monday tuesday is kita punya satu module jer kita ada for this sem for next coming sem ah satu module jer but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
kirakan major ah like what we want
macam we have macam performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot ah performing arts then we have
apa tu packaging motion design semua then we can only choose three aku ambil
okay what macam aku ambil figure drawing is the same what but it's still under fine arts what
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of apa tu routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then uh from that three then kita belajar then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem aku tak dapat ambil dua yang figure drawing full kan
ya so aku just have to cause my I only have to take two for my module ya huh oh my god aku four jer eh mmhmm
oh ya ya but packaging ah the aku dengan effy took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what oh design and brand strategy because honestly uh kalau kita ada tiga ni benda kan then intern kita will be easier though ya because like for us macam apa eh
ya and honestly aku tak sabar untuk intern I don't know why
cause like I feel like kita boleh pilih but at the same time macam our lecturer will be the one that ya but uh honestly after that after this coming semester kan kita ada three months holiday right then me and effy thought of like kerja at any uh graphic comm punya firm and then from there kalau like we feel that in in apa tu that company is quite good then we just continue until intern lah
dah ada kerja what you mean okay uh huh
kerja for that really meh no lah I don't think so tu ni diploma
the process then kau will first day macam for example first day kau is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya lah so apa yang kau nak start dalam year two sem two ya lah the process is year two sem two lah ya lah okay so that's what I should've say girl
hmm entah eh I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can macam
then after that like uh tak the cons is like you have to compete with everybody ah
and a bit like macam
in your face tau macam company tu tak nak kau macam ouch sakit sia honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they dekat apa tu indeed aku nampak banyak macam art teacher abeh those apa eh
that C word I forget what is that for the ni lah budak-budak art
bukan taxi lah aduh
I mean like your course quite broad lah honestly and yesterday also aku cari macam kedai-kedai eh kedai eh company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to kerja as part time eh stop it
ya so stop hais eh kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang picking packer okay lah this whole week kau take a break then maybe kita start kerja next week ah
kalau bukan this week kau nak confirm dengan aku bila okay okay okay
hais no cause aku start kerja kan
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail punya position I can find other retail stores to work you know it's a stall but macam kirakan there's a lot of macam promoter at each section so you are doing that kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga overall then kau kena tengok-tengok and at the same time you have to like go for the customer ni semua lah
point you know oh my god I just censored my own ya and then like I never even get that position so aku it's a retail position or cashiering I don't know I mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store kau kena take care of ya so exactly that's why aku terus like
aku dah tak aku dah quit I told shah about it and then I was super depressed you know what I did they don't even know what I'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like oh you can just go to the customer then I'm like oh okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
I think six hours nine eleven to six eh I just whatsapp the manager ah say like the environment is not for me uh what uh this is honestly not what I expected it lah macam this is not the position I he haven't reply but I left the group already ya kalau tak esok aku kerja esok thursday aku actually dah full this this week

I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my and ya they uh then end up orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah exactly so I'm like exactly then uh effy is quite mad ya
effy dia sot lah tak aku example it's like really unfair ah I don't know why but it's just the school lah I can say
you show macam orang punya kerja it's like a good thing lah but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
apa tu copy yours and do better and after that
and you are still kat bawah trying to survive padahal kau punya it's like orang yang copy
eh kau suka pergi hiking tak

entah lah
not every ah ya can say ya macam friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo ah so every time dia nak patah balik patah balik sunday ya
aku tak bilang siapa-siapa ya it's like I don't know ah at times we gaduh and then like but that one time we gaduh right quite rabak ya but uh the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it macam you know if we break it off then what's the point of us macam wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct mm the thing I like about him right dia punya mindset is really mature oi he's your age ya
then like I don't know ah dia macam dia cakap like kalau you dah tak suka I semua ke apa in our relationship anytime tau kalau aku just dah tak ada feelings but just bilang dia and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go lah kalau tak macam if he wants to make it work lah ya so it's like very matured thing ah at the same time kalau kita nak break it off
we have to really macam talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
ya really a lot until we I think he um apa eh I call kan dia tak angkat
at that point macam betul-betul like he like we had enough of each other lah
but then macam um during the period the first few weeks terus macam makin lama makin okay then now it's better ah
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right dengan my school schedule then like we met almost everyday sia then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that

you know like it's pointless if we keep advising but they don't really ya honestly aku tak kisah kalau dia tak nak ikut ke tak because it's usually up to the person lah but at least consider of what I say lah or like try to say it in a way whereby kau kau akan kena you know or like just reflect prepare you ya ya so it's like you are not you are not actually hearing what I said ya
what again I thought they have been bestie again daripada dulu sampai sekarang

ya lah it's just the makeover you know entah lah
kau jangan merepek lah kau aku pun tak tahu kadang-kadang keluar kadang-kadang turun balik I'm not in a constant mood aku dah malas already

cause aku tak pakai makeup uh aku pakai makeup aku pakai makeup that time kan dia cakap

aku year two kan legit oi macam no effort
time aku pakai makeup pun pergi luar jer mm ya aku pun dah malas
then like entah eh
apa tu dressing up and all when you're school is how many hours jer
entah ah exactly that's that's the thing
ya ya because I feel like it's very macam entah eh you feel like shit mm makeup everything ya I agree I agree because like you don't you don't want to be the
macam the sad looking person amongst all the pretty girls ah penat ah kadang-kadang
aku dengan kawan aku yang perempuan perempuan pun semua pakai makeup lawa-lawa then aku macam alamak then nanti you stress on your own oh shit what am I supposed to wear oh my god what am I supposed to actually same
but usually at some point aku dah malas gila aku pakai aku punya baseball jersey dengan aku punya jeans dah abeh orang pakai kasut kan semua lawa-lawa aku pakai slipper oi
legit eh dah malas ah mm
then eh busy punya
ya sometimes no heck care lah ya that time pun birthday party kawan aku wah I find it wah really pointless it was last week uh after I send shah then uh dress code K me being a person where I wear black and white everyday cause I'm a very monochrome person right
my friend err the dress code is warm tones alamak ya lah but then all the tu apa yang skirt tu aku dah tak boleh muat oi tu year one aku kecil sia aku sekarang dah gemuk oi legit I walk away a lot when I was with shah cause we eat a lot ya then after that aku macam alamak
I wore white t-shirt eh white uh long sleeve dengan yang skirt tu apa tu yang shawl hitam ya so it was okay
then terus aku macam alamak nak pakai apa eh tengok aku punya closet tinggal satu baju white apa warm tones kan warna brown tapi it's not really brown it's brownish yellow abeh semua stripes stripes ada warna putih then aku macam alamak pakai jer lah and then I
err for me it's like err macam very
masai ah
not aunty lah but masai ah macam entah ah selekeh ah then after that aku jumpa kawan-kawan aku semua tak ikut dress code lepas tu dia orang cakap dia orang tak ada then aku macam abeh semua pakai baju top warna putih abeh seluar hitam then aku macam bro I could've just wore that seh abeh kawan aku yang perempuan lagi pakai hitam
aku dah macam girl at the birthday party right is only the family yang pakai warm tones then aku just macam I'm like what so ya orh it's actually merepek ah oh tu pun aku dah tak boleh muat eh skirt tu ya I want to I don't know where that skirt go already or ya kita pergi museum pe cause that time ada yang mm neon light that one kind ya sekarang dah boring ah neon light
you know I don't uh she told me that she don't like but I feel that she like him dah lama cause girl
ya and then dia cakap aku ada bilang kau kan yang dia orang pergi club together and all oh my god
then aku cakap kau kalau seri bilang kau kau act macam tak tahu jer eh aku cakap gitu
ya honestly my class sekarang is not really actually bonded every class aku pergi is not bonded
it's all clique by clique by clique which I find it macam a bit irritating ah
ya so aku sekarang stick dengan effy jer walaupun the other girls kan dia orang satu clique err like ada chinese girls dengan chinese girls and then kita ada lagi satu girls macam macam indonesian dengan singaporean macam campur but dia orang semua baik ah aku punya orang is
even though I have three err I'm always like with that one friend I will always be neutral to everybody ya so macam mana-mana aku pergi nanti dia orang macam eh nelly nelly so aku macam okay ah then like um that that one group of girls semua okay lah dia orang okay dengan aku so aku okay ah
melayu indonesia cina ya campur-campur ah
cause kadang-kadang aku tak ada benda nak buat buat pun aku pergi kat dia orang macam hey how's your work
ya group work pun kadang-kadang aku just campur dia orang
err nadhirah eh uh huh khine ya dia suka
tahu pasal huh how they know
no girl it's very hard for him to like somebody and the way the girls that he like is all mostly chinese or korean or japanese dia punya pasal lah eh macam girls like angel yes ya you know malays is super hard ah kalau nak kawan dengan dia kawan rapat macam kita boleh I feel like a lot of girls jealous bila kita rapat dengan him because kita jumpa khine kita selalu macam peluk abeh rapat-rapat pe but he's like for me it's like I don't know eh
ya and I put the line already eh you know and I find him more like girl friend instead of a boy friend macam hey khine mm okay
nanti kadang-kadang macam hey girl then aku macam aku terus khine then after that ah that time aku masih in my in my clique ah aku nampak dia kat err apa campus one lobby abeh lepas tu dia macam hey girl then wear tudung tau
then semua orang tengok aku tau then terus kita lari kita peluk each other dia macam macam you know those like love movies like something then we just we just have each other ah then everyone look at us you know macam semua tak expect ah like um macam dia kan handsome nak mampus so everyone confirm macam err confirm everyone macam oh I want to be the one that is hugging I don't know lah kadang-kadang I find it macam a bit merepek ah
hmm entah aku tak tahu nak berbual dengan siapa aku macam okay let's just berbual dengan budak-budak pakai tudung mana tahu dia orang baik ah aku macam gitu but then once I heard kau hello I'm anna I'm twenty one from girl be my friend
because everyone is very young eh at that point then I'm like huh ya that's why it's like entah ah but the the reason why I was close with shaz first because I was the only one that talk to her during that general ya class
cause that time aku cakap dengan shafiq err aku just nak cari classmate aku ah macam kawan daripada class aku kan at least ah aku boleh pergi kelas dengan dia aku tak seorang ya so that's my ya because she sit in front of me tak aku just try out jer then aku just hi uh like what class you from oh I from uh one that time kita punya class apa one G eh honestly tak ingat apa dia cakap one G
oh girl same class then kita just all the way together ah plus from there aku tanya dia like
uh why you not rapat with the other girl semua like our class semua okay aku cakap gitu ah macam all about the worried about the class thingy
okay so I she's going away we're going to get her a present ah and ya I think you're right the frames are too heavy we're not going to give those but how I don't want it to be like macam buku yang just print out like that biarkan gitu then it's just gonna sit in a cupboard forever I feel like it will be cool if it was something that she
can see everyday you know especially in that country maybe lots of pictures of us in the sunshine macam while she freezing her butt off there
yes yes yes yes ya ya ya so it's not just err err apa tu what we going to make
err phone phone case it can be anything it can be a mug it can be a t-shirt boleh apa-apa kan
but no you want a gift that can on that day itself be looked at right okay okay fine ya ya then I think ya we can find some small light items nak buat dia punya print ah so we're gotta select a bunch of pictures of what we like right and then
figure out what are the things I'm sure they have online presence mesti ada kalau kau pergi dia punya website dia cakap that these are the things you can bring on or something ah or if not actually there are a lot of websites that do that so macam vista print
cause they are that kind of digital printers so they do everything so okay so let's pick out a bunch of pictures kita pilih mana yang kita suka then that becomes the photo book and then we pick out a few others ya okay can ah I guess that is the plan
aku tak ada tak ada bilik tau bilik aku is my sister you know so cause I was living elsewhere so my things were always a minimum ah and then both times when I go government staycation also
again I lost a lot of things so my whole life has been a series of losing shit lah moving and macam just all over the place so when it meant that when I moved into this house I just didn't have
why can't it not be us apa jer okay so how about we make a poster ah of us
when forever in your heart you know sort of vibes ah ya ya it's ultimate narcissism for a group that is so in love with ourselves gitu
what is the deal dia secretive gila ah sia aku tak tahu dia sekarang at which point you know are their tickets booked is that is what is happening over there you know
sharing about it like that time I I thought her her attitude was interesting like she was dia cakap that um
she don't want to talk about it to people cause she's afraid to like jinx it gitu and then she would also feel very embarrassed if she was supposed to leave on a certain date and then didn't then people will like macam
eh nisa why you never leave eh kau apa sia I'm like can't imagine who the who the hell would actually do that to her
tak aku rasa it is that ya ya ya when it comes to him you're right they got some secretive things aku aku rasa that dia cakap dengan nisa that these things kau tak payah share dengan kau punya friends I think so too I think that is that sort of understanding between them which
ya lah it's their partners lah we should respect that ah but I just thought there was some fear there you know of people mocking her and I'm like um you a bit too old to have this fear tapi dia kadang-kadang got got that kind of little streaks of like
how to be her own person ah like she will stand up to people and she will I liked it when I see her at parties and she very mother hen with all the younger ones I think it allows her to make a lot of friends cause she goes in like a kakak kakak you know she goes in like
ah kau dah okay tak and then aku boleh cakap dengan kau gini gini gitu gitu like like she's just how are you macam mana sekarang sekolah gitu gini you know and ya
ya I I don't understand what it could take macam ah ya unless somebody changes drastically and that could happened sometimes somebody becomes bitter or alcoholic you get what I mean ah then you become a bit wonky ah
ya both both both to tini okay got it okay so she felt like somehow you macam take tini
together apa kau orang semua sama-sama tu ah
so abeh at that point kau tak cakap apa-apa dengan dia
abeh kau tak terasa nak cakap apa-apa dengan dia cause kau dah tahu kan ah
ah dengan tini
siapa jas dengan tini asal eh dia orang macam
so hari tu bila kita dah sampai dekat pizza cause again I'm lost in my own world did they have a chat outside dia orang berbual
ya ya ya ya ya ya unless you're coming to eat with us then okay lah it's clear tapi kau
iya lah like like like you like to
ya okay okay okay ya ya ya nobody really likes that anyway ya ya ya yup ya ya ya I understand tahu
jadi kau bila kau berbual dengan sarah kau adalah explain dengan dia that the reason why that even came up in the first place was pasal kau nak understand make tini understand that she's being played ah
did did we post that picture in the group chat with dengan dia punya cake nama dia tu ah K K
tahu tahu tahu ya ya ya ya kau percayalah ya I know I know I know I know I know I know ya
ah correct correct it's new information for someone you know as opposed to macam mengeluh over somebody usual pattern tu lain
ya tak tahu seh cerita cerita ni semuanya
ya tu lah tu lah
then I also wonder oh is it because we just don't say these things kita mana nak belajar pasal boundary and learn how to do it
ah ah correct aku rasa macam
tu lah tu lah kami datang nak petik bunga di taman awak
ya it's the bahasa berbunga and the gentleness of the language overall lah ya ya ya makes it hard
I bet you would have kau mesti ketawa macam perempuan gila in the corner and make it a lot worse than it is nanti dia fikir aku betul-betul suan dia
confirm tau kau punya sense of humour kadang-kadang like no janganlah
ah so azmi tahu ah hari ini kau datang sini buat ni ah kau cakap dengan dia
kita tengah we are currently in about let me see twenty seven minutes we are about halfway through ah azmi can you entertain yourself
ya I did say no background noise but that was just a really quick one kami minta maaf iya
ah or maybe I do I don't know I have to go in and check that might be some ground ginger from my mum she likes this she gives me ground ginger so I could mix it with some hot water and and something okay I'll go look at it after this actually I'm getting damn hungry so after this I do aku nak pergi makan
aku nak makan mak aku punya briyani tak kisah pergi mampus dengan perut aku and come and taste some a bit sedap makan dia dengan curry all these
mak aku masak two days ago national day feasts
ah tu ah tu pun ada I didn't even know we had this tradition tapi tak pasal-pasal ah hari ni national day kita ada briyani abeh aku is not not having it so that day I was out at brunch then after brunch went over to to aman friends place right so I was
ya do you know there was my national day was so non eventful on my way to brunch which I had with a friend dekat at kat upper thomson aku pass by dekat road aku nampak banyak-banyak orang semua diri dekat luar road
then aku thought they were going somewhere but no cause it's this mobile columns that's moving right so that's why I did not know about this mobile columns at all so I was like why are they just standing there kalau kau nak pergi somewhere jalan ah asal diri sana panas terik tu hari tu aku dengar forty one degrees
apa ni you're supposed to kill people that's what the war machine is for right but ah no but apart from that I had no idea it was national day I didn't even hear fireworks can you see from here
jadi sekarang macam mana kau nak try tackle one of the questions
folklore and petua-petua kesihatan you get what I mean for like different ah different food items whether it's different types of herbs different types of leaves different types of yams whatever from indonesia
the waiter comes out and the presentation is beautiful the way he like opens up the kau tahu macam bunga-bunga apa tu eh bunga ulam eh or is it the bunga-bunga macam
look like banana flower kind of vibe ah or top ginger you know that kind where you sort of peel it open kan ah lepas tu the way yang dia orang serve and like plate the thing and then telling the explanation of what it's for and how do people use it are there any stories associated with it I thought that was a really memorable meal cause everything that you taste suddenly had a lot of significance and I'm sure we all had meals like that and I think whenever somebody plans meal kan
ah tu
bila larut malam punya vibes ah
ya ya ya actually I don't even know about I feel like I've got aku pernah dengar nama dia saffron tapi aku tak tahu kat mana dia kat bugis
where is it tampines ah okay okay okay ya lah maybe that's why aku tak travel out lah
it's very random and it goes straight to tampines I don't even know why normally the road ni kira ada feeder bus jer biasanya tapi sekarang ada one two seven apa benda
and I've been seeing a lot more of this large bright green buses punya bus baru punya ah ah dia orang macam tak tahu ni bus baru ke service baru but
ah new buses lah right that they bought ya ya ya ya so from tadi yang aku faham bus ni kalau kalau kalau kau ambil bus ni dia terus pergi highway
do not pass do not collect two hundred dollars dia terus pergi highway lepas tu kau end up in tampines in berapa minute okay lah not minute lah but iya lah you get the idea ya ya very short ah
but they take awhile they all take awhile they will go and explore kat mana kita pergi tengok-tengok err geylang mari lah kita boleh tengok katong
mm katong ya there's a lot of ah detours ah tak faham seh
ah ask bird park pun bird park aku sakit hati aku ambil bus pergi sana one and half hour sia
pantat kering ah that I basically aku need to sampai boon lay
ah bird park kau kau cakap apa zoo eh
dia orang masih tak email aku sia after aku hantar resume aku about that was I think on the seventh
dia dia cakap they didn't basically dia macam portal gitu kau upload upload resume apa benda then at the end it just had a your resume has been successfully submitted ah ah kau tunggu three weeks
then the meantime there are other things like my I have a friend who call me and it's basically what this is is a startup habis startup ni dia macam kumpul together all the plumbers electricians sort of thing okay then you would it works like a uber where you would find a service and book it and then abeh kau kau boleh tengok dia punya err err route to you ah macam macam macam grab delivery ah boleh nampak dia punya driver on the way to you how long more it will take blah blah blah
and then ah they need somebody to help coordinate this things in the back end and also err check out on the services that is provided tanya lah dengan orang tu okay okay tak dia orang buat ada apa-apa rosak ada apa-apa okay complain ke apa benda um
so that's that the job seems rather interesting tapi I'm I'm a little concerned about it on a couple of levels ah firstly dia startup abeh baru start apa apa cerita dia sebenarnya you know like what is the process and is it kau orang ada macam any or template in place or actually kau orang tengah cari orang untuk start the whole thing up you know from scratch properly cause if that's the case ya okay I I also don't have problem with that but I would need to make sure that I'm paid
there are already a lot of websites where you can even like directories and you can kau boleh filter down tau kau tinggal kat mana orang ni kat mana ah that kind of thing it's not something new ah this
pulling together of different house jobs you know plumbing ah carpentry little bit that sort of thing it really exists a lot jadi aku macam err apa seh
nak try ke tak
abeh in the meantime ada benda macam gini okay aku happy nak buat I don't know why sia I don't know ah I'm feeling macam don't want to work and then also the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and there's all this weirdness and more jobs to be lost and the economy is going to shit
it's not a way of avoiding the world it's just aku don't feel like dealing with you all right now it's too much crap I don't feel like it I'm not having it
leave ah I learn this new word vibing I'm just vibing man so kira macam tangkap jer ah vibing so I vibe ah
ah ah ah betul
betul betul betul and just live a simple basic life for awhile right ya
ya ya I would get into something quite obsessively I think you know like just explore or pursue or an interest sampai
ya ya ya the whole thing is a very romance novel vibe yes ya with the hair and the jawline it's very like the guys that you find on the cover of romance novel gitu ah
tu ah abeh macam kau terasa ah kau terasa macam kau nak extra mentel gitu tak tahu dari mana punya ni ah
that's also a romance novel apa macam the rope who you tame taming the rope
pangkeng means apa eh
oh tu tu yang kau orang panggil hotel ah rumah uncle
tak tahu seh
kau kau bayangkan hidup mesti ada concept
kau bayangkan ada cakap dengan kau hidup mesti ada concept computer programme
eh kau
kira macam gang ah ah ah ah ah
alah geramnya it's like asking your parents kita sebenarnya asal dari kampung mana seh
mm mm mm mm mm budak marsiling
okay kau boleh nampak malaysia tapi sana tak ada causeway tak ada apa kan there's no bridge
toa payoh aku rasa mungkin ada port
alah sedih
aku macam >pakai file tak pakai file pun dia orang tak kisah seh
ah ah betul
I I went to this activist event ah some time ago two years ago I think it's called apa itu activist so it was mainly organized by AWARE and a lot of other like MARUAH all this ah different activists and groups here in singapore then one of it had breakup session so then you can pick
which room you want to go to participate in which session ah so I went to this one particular room where dia orang macam mana tau macam lebih kurang tiga puluh orang tiga puluh orang sit in a circle berdiri in a circle
and then berdiri in a circle lepas tu the person yang moderator diri dekat tengah dia cakap okay if you have these things that I'm about to say you step back
if you don't if you never had these things then you step forward so they started asking ah kau ada maid tak kau pernah ada maid rumah kau abeh kalau kau ada kau step back
so abeh ask more questions ah macam kau pernah ada rumah family kau ada kereta tak kau orang pernah pergi holiday kau pernah rasa macam snow basically questions about privilege ah then at the end of the thirty forty questions that he asked
kau boleh nampak ah siapa yang kat tengah siapa yang kat belakang sikit abeh yang kat tengah banyak was a lot of brown people also cause some of the questions that was asked was also macam have have anybody made fun of your name
abeh aku found myself right in the middle with two other people
I was a bit confused about being in the middle cause I thought I ada pretty good life you know ya we got no maid no car all these tapi there's always food on the table I had uniforms I've heard so many other stories of people who had it so much worse right that was interesting but then
dia semua pun ada abeh kenapa orang lain tak boleh ada ni semua kenapa hidup dia orang nak kena sampai macam gini seh
couldn't he just kept crying and crying the group macam went around him abeh sayang sayang dia and
betul betul betul aku ada terfikir tau at that moment macam eh kau yang nangis sepatutnya aku yang patut nangis apa sia kau nangis tapi aku rasa tapi aku rasa kadang-kadang
tu ah ya ya correct correct there was a sense of that there's definitely a sense of that but then there was also a sense of maybe you need to
like be far removed from the from the situation in order to sympathize with it sometimes when you are too close in the situation dia macam apa tak kisah ah buat jer ah
tapi when you are far away you realised actually this person doesn't need to do this you know this person should be able to have other options instead of being forced to towards doing X Y Z so maybe he was in the better position to to understand privilege than we do cause he's
I don't know I don't know what it is ah about us like you said maybe it's that change over from technology that's change and suddenly from a position of being macam a bit suaku about the world suddenly we see a lot more we see a lot more riches we also see a lot more pain and poverty
eh aku tak suka ah dia orang punya cerita tak habis-habis tak habis-habis pasal aku dulu ah very very poor tau aku tak ada duit family aku tak ada duit
main soccer
macam are you listening to yourself not bro
ah kau tak ada script ke ni sikit-sikit ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya and who's writing this maybe the people writing it are tone deaf in the first place you understand like aku can imagine them choosing some like rich fuck
oh this is the whampoa ya but cause kau orang punya the other side siapa lim tian
lim tian sama dengan randolf ah
randolf was volunteering with lim tian apa
it's for people who are scared lah it does need they need to be told that cause even this election banyak kali sia macam naomi had colleagues my mother had friends who all said your vote is not secret in singapore
this fear is still there ah and aku rasa the the the likes this fear to be there cause then senang apa untuk dia orang
ah kau try ah nanti aku tak kasih kau covered walkways kau nak covered walkways
but now I see my apa I was specially recognised as a top fan
it's a facebook group ya ya ya I was so proud of myself aku macam I took a screenshot and send to naomi and say my accomplishment for today everybody we must achieve something
hidup mesti ada concept
okay I'm actually very stress lah pasal the my wedding lah
that was the initial plan err tapi entah the situation can change you kno
err kalau we we I moved to his house kan at least nak pindah to our new house it's lagi dekat lah I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the barang</malay
mm then don't know lah to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house eh and then like rohana because kesian kan the the the budak macam</malay
tak kan nak share satu bilik perempuan lelaki unless they are willing to build err bunk bed lah which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed err we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed cuma share bilik saja</malay
so I thinking kalau if we move to my parents house the
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least ada bilik and the house is bigger then dia pun dia pun cakap like oh ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
ah itu dia macam takut not really takut lah like you know too dah biasa tinggal kat east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding tapi due to budget lah kan um
maybe consider to do two separate size lah so cuma no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be leceh you know because we have to tak kan I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
aiya ya just basically just a bit susah lah
yes but then tak semestinya we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider macam like like what mother cakap is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
oh that one I didn't check err because the only thing that I check was that if let's say um we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate ke tak</malay
ah because err I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong lah six months atau three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like dulu lah s
entah but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then um one thing about the the is florida kasi ready ready like err provide the flooring err basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare lah
err tapi I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply ah it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so err tak sangka that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan oh uh wedding macam mana err how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the saudara mara dah besar besar how about lik
the budak the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is satu famil
ah okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part eh for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year dah kena deposit you know o
ah okay but then I mean ya lah whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows sekarang pun is about the same tapi we do have like thoughts abou
memang okay memang we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
kita buat kat bawah block ya let's say for my side ah
I kita buat kat bawah block you have to consider that oh catering and decoration may not be under one err one company we may be separate and then err apa ni like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one err price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like macam you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
mak andam all this separate lik
for me I think like oh because kita buat combine and it is a location that can provide a lot macam for the one at orchard righ
and if you want kompang then that one is different thing lah then the only thing that I have to worry about is um the ride
uh the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because kalau boleh I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know lah my dad punya thinking i
you know that budget right make it a small nikah and then just makan makan lah after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know lah my father got problem so and lagi pun</malay
good wedding ah is really really great lah so macam entah jus
okay ah if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him lah because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the duit hantaran and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs err to ferry to each other to each side lah so at least kalau macam at one locatio
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like kalau buat two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit kan susah and then kesian the mak andam kadang kadang I'm not thinking for myself lah I am thinking for other people so y
that's why lah is really really hard for me to think about this lagi lagi two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there lah from now lah
I mean I get it lah you told me to work on it tapi the problem is I have been discussing like
parents lah all about these tapi I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
kita banyak discuss within each other its tapi entah lah when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then macam</malay
okay okay boleh okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum uh his mum atau she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least alah dah biasa makeup sendiri is best to you know biar orang kat orang makeup kan orang kan lagi pun</malay
ya the mak andam dia punya at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already lah eh the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just tutup one eye lah for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and lagi pun</malay
uh tapi kahwin sekarang
itu pun okay no doubt her big plans changed ah but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the um th
planner is helping lah so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make bawah block lah
but because now really very hard right so the err dia parents cakap okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels lah
so her concern is that eh bento box mana cukup like is a malay wedding tau you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento macam is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that lah but then because of this eh err she had actually got enough as i
ya of course lah you too just want the nikah but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see ah lagi alah I think because the his mother also macam</malay
alah mak pak dia dah tua so he she's been trying to push him to get married lah so I don't know whether that means that oh just cepat cepat kahwin then dah or just want to make it a big even
because lah ya lah like you mention that I'm still considered an uh outside outsider kan so I mean kalau boleh I don't want to masuk campur lah whatever happens because it's not my family ye
tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana I mean kalau boleh I tak nak masuk campur bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what ah sebab ini pun ya at this time pun is good lah to get married cuma</malay
definitely lah now you kan confirm ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean tak yah by choice lah but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if kata that err you want to invite a certain family member tapi sangat jauh actually like four hours is like already long lah kan
kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput kan family jauh tu jauh lah tapi tetap i
jauh in the sense of distance lah not is in terms of family tree so macam like there was one example that my friend she just got married like uh think two months ag
err)she was apologising to ah semua like ah sorry ya tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak limit kat family jer then we all macam trying to reassure lah tak apa lah kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom lah I mean no issue what tapi ya tapi you all are like my like my friends and also macam I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam kalau boleh jangan lama lama kan don't delay right but then alah since they actually tuhan dah dah tau eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind lah just get ready lah but err but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still kat rumah so limited to I think fifty person right termasuk her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like macam sedih because only family is there ah no friend so macam like entah lah I don't know lah whether she still feels bad or not uh so she's been trying to like you come lah you come over to my house lah we will have lik
makan makan session or something but then of course due to schedule lah we cannot commit to certain times right y
because we are considered err sekarang first time righ
ya like like okay lah you can like still had ya know tu I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also lah and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as dah bilang the parents then at least bila the both sides nak jumpa to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor yang for him is the duit hantaran actually until now I don't know the difference oh duit hantaran and mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's kalau macam untuk pasal wedding ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin that one is okay is i
and then for hantaran that one is considered lik
no no no not the barang hantaran but duit</malay
cheque kosong dah melampau kot actually kalau let's sa
maybe because of all these uh hantaran right I didn't actually eh one post kat Facebook um this err is like a page lah where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like macam those magazin
got married um in iBloom apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded lah drag until like baru baru juga lah and then um bagaimana tahu that the husband have a lot of hutang</malay
on top of the wedding tau because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because dah kenal lama</malay
sejak dulu so they they feel that okay lah since dah kenal lama kan and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage ah so maybe because it'
err macam it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that kan dorang kena ada hutang and then some more at the same time dorang nak dapat rumah which I don't know how lah so macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that dia macam stress like dia yang perlu kahwin tapi you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like err bukan apa ni bukan</malay
err loan daripada along lah its like those err school punya fees then dia minta bank loan for study he eh from what I read leh he the husband did investment so investment hilang duit</malay
so because dia tak boleh bayar I don't know lah all this thing I I don't understand lah so so she's like was asking pendapat lah like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so macam to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing sama kan
ah against her or citing her so those yang against her right are like macam you kno
a lot of people macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it lah
tak kisah lah sayang ke kenal lama ke because I've had err friends eh who actually tunang urgent dating lama tunang about two years tapi ended they didn't managed to go throug
wah that means either like they are not ready financially atau just dah tak ada feeling lagi lah which saya macam pelik eh like you tahan for so long as in not say tahan lah dating for so long and the bila tunang you just give up ah
ya lah a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because dia nak minta pendapat eh
correct but then entah lah I feel like but then to me kan kalau going back to my friend eh um together for seven year
and then tunang for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got dugaan when they tunang tapi I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so apa beza ya when you sarung cincin then oh suddenly all the problems come up you kno
so macam that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that oh okay ah lepas ni uh nak fikirkan tinggal mana uh nak duduk mana but it's the fact that oh it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already tapi kan the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding eh is lik
the lauk is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
err if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of lauk</malay
uh the other one is like the basic lah got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like kuih muih ah it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
he close bridal tahu then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else oh ya we can offer you th
kambing golek for about I think uh fifty people or the we'll issue uh like one thousand satay stick
uh as in uh part of the bridal right that means is uh tak salah it's two outfi
two outfit and then with mak andam everything he compared with the price of kambing and satay
who would wanted seh and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person tahu and they even dare to say you know err because you know lah perangai kita after every wedding mesti will lik
this one tahu they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event lah we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe pukul enam ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me oh
so you want to stay as long as you want tak kisah do you know padahal both of them ar
kirakan muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies lah basically so macam it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better tapi the
eh so dah okay eh
tak lah nama nama samaran ke apa tak tahu

then masak for my husband and kids then ya I feel safer for that lah
aiya tanggungjawab mah tak apa lah boleh
eh batuk-batuk pula
five days is so long imagine you sakit then after that you kena five days
eh tapi
you pernah kena sakit ke
tak ada special queue ke untuk kita
ah tengok lah bila my husband on leave cause ke sebab sekarang kan december holiday kan
ya that's true so sebab tu lah then government baru kasih seratus dolar untuk kita jalan-jalan
oh go lah I see like ada staycation then um holiday then I saw my friend kat facebook lah dia tulis dia cakap dia
for kids one they they get this hundred dollars ke you see lah I haven't got the chance to redeem it
ya lor tapi complain cakap yang ini mahal lah
because staycation is known to everyone that memang mahal but I think
government dah kasih duit tu is good enough
hais susah lah I'm waiting for the COVID to go off so I can
malaysia sepatutnya kasih singaporean masuk I think january but I think sebab case dia orang tiba-tiba naik I don't think it will come that fast lah
the I think the quality got a bit better tapi the inside you can actually put the filter
then the dia punya outer layer yang kena mulut tu is actually very silky so I tak sure lah benda tu really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
ya tapi surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
oh yang apa tu makan dekat seoul garden ke apa tu eh
oh my that one to bring like what the whole family macam reunion dinner
ya lah but tapi orang-orang ni pun kena lah jaga apa um the
jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok lah asyik lupa jer apa nak cakap
um jaga
whatever the government say kena ikut but the problem is I think kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three pun masih belum ada apa-apa so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
ya talking about parents kan my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out lah sebab
tapi the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
mm lagi kat got orchard then now what dia orang punya christmas period I think tak ada lah mesti orang-orang ni mesti still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
you know banyak malaysian kerja kat sini kan
they don't have any place to sleep over at uh singapore sekarang
ya lah that's true tapi at least dia orang come up with some um apa tu nama dia solution for the malaysian lah I heard that they give um
oh eh you think ah the people who come to singapore yang malaysia yang
dia orang nak hantar barang you know like those barang-barang kita mostly datang dari malaysia pe
like the sayur like all those foods lah you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
mm eh you remember or not yang masa the first time yang COVID nineteen ni um keluar at news then they were asking for people to be yang swabbers
eh you have any friends working for that or not sebab dia orang tak train kan
wah but I think most of these people yang
jadi swabbers ni maybe dia orang kehilangan kerja kan
then apa dia wear those um protective gear
wah leceh juga eh but I really pity those yang
kena berhenti kerja then they have like what two three anak to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what um home
hmm I think also um government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know lah some of us ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time sebab
like losing their mask so sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids tapi of course it's a added cost lah imagine sekarang berapa fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal tau
macam mana tu very expensive to have a surgical mask
eh so you don't have plans ah for the december tak ambil leave ke maybe plan outing with your family ke
sebab iya lah special day kan mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan
but tu lah COVID lah restricted
betul lah for me pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang kan so for me my family kita nak pergi staycation
kesian budak-budak kan dia orang
okay selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu um then birthday cake then kalau saya time
bulan puasa tu saya sempat lah buat kuih raya untuk orang yang order tapi saya buat untuk small scale jer lah kan sebab government pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk family friends only
kalau masak usually I will just cook uh whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like mi bandung um nasi lemak you know those normal stuff sampai tak tahu nak masak apa
betul juga um before this I realised that after the
tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu deprive others lah untuk beli makan tambahan then you imagine if let's say gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya
ya tapi mana lah orang ni nak ikut undang-undang so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest lah
ah ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid
semua sekarang online
doing the delivery like grab apa lagi eh deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
so I think people with uh young kids sepatutnya maybe could just do something else lah
eh kita ni asyik cakap pasal government aje dah lah kita cakap pasal makanan pula lah mm I'm hungry already do you want to eat
uh eh I saw like they have uh kentang
with kentang then yourself is
but by having this kind of high tech technology eh you see for older generation yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
cause you imagine orang-orang tua lagi they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh you know do the normal stuff like even going down
keluar to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage lah not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us lah orang-orang muda macam kita
at this point you how do I say eh macam
mm betul
mm betul tu
tapi saya rasa kalau um mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar
then expose diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin inshallah dia orang boleh buat
mm betul tu
mm tak apa lah awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli handphone yang
mungkin boleh guna handphone yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada handphone ace samsung ace saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya lah
tapi saya rasa pun di rumah orang tua not much of um they don't have internet access so that's why nak kena beli line which is also an added cost
sebab mereka tak use internet ah data as much as us kan kalau kita facebook instagram baca news uh semua lah
tapi masalahnya saya tak rasa macam awak cakap tak ramai lah yang mempelajari barang-barang baru seperti ini
mm mungkin
ya tapi saya rasa mungkin lama lagi kot
dengan malaysia begitu indonesia dan ingat tak hong-kong baru-baru ni dia orang nak buka hong-kong balik tapi tak jadi sebab ada about other infection case
ya oh cakap pasal ni saya teringat tentang
saya rasa dia orang pun tak ada bazar lah
sedih kan
tapi saya rasa kalau bila dah fasa ketiga dia orang in naikkan number of people to lapan
saya tidak tahu macam mana sebab saya rasa penat juga duduk di singapore sahaja
mm keluar especially bangkok kan
tak apa lah saya rasa saya nak buat staycation nanti
betul juga tapi tu lah staycation in singapore very expensive but it's okay end of the year
tidak risau dan also um
tu macam safe safe apa tu saya tak nampak lah
oh dah macam police ya mereka
wah dia orang dah pusing sini berapa kali
mm apa tugasan mereka yang patut mereka buat kerana saya rasa
tak ada benda yang mereka harus report then
a bit of waste manpower pula
ah oh ya baru saya ingat yang masa period tu
ada berapa video yang keluar pasal auntie uncle kat luar
mm then ada yang tak nak pakai mask susah lah nak nasihatkan orang
okay lah cuma kesian kat orang berbaju merah ni apa nama dia lagi
tapi yang um rasanya ada baju mereka tu ada yang letak mungkin
saya okay jer ah tengok tu dia tengah bebual dengan pakcik tu
pakcik tu tak pakai mask lah
sekejap ya saya check dalam app

we were googling on uh how to grow taller then ada they got sell some pills and stuff but then they say
lajukan your hormones or something like that
I actually like lupa
I lupa nak reply her
okay I'm going to reply her after I makan
then like after I makan I was like
tapi like I don't want then I felt like
so semalam like
I told my mum and my kakak was like
to like clean like cause apa nama dia err yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my almari from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the buku-buku
and then I shifted all the I I I simpan the book balik
and then what happened to the one keluar you know what time we keluar or not we went out like
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to beli right
I went to spotlight sebab I want to find
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to jahit for my
which tak habis-habis
ya so I was trying to find a breathable kain
main thing that I wanted to cari was the
like find the kain
turns out it was like dekat dalam
an almari
tadi tadi while while bathing I was
cik saya nak order
nak order suji boleh
tapi usually like people sell suji that
as I was saying tadi
I was trying to think macam like
err when is a good time for us to record lah cause macam
at five masih very very very memekak
crowded here and because that time masa masa we shot at kim punya place
yang we went to jewel eh I think
like all my close friends I only like keluar with the for like
like satu bulan eh no dua bulan sekali kind of thing you know
or like tiga bulan sekali
ah ya ya ya apa
give it a listen nanti lepas ni
I think the korean industry is kind of like macam
apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap eh
and it's damn big it's like besar gila and
real lah macam
pakai yang the one that I told you about hari tu that it karat
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs kan sebab it's like one for one
um when I was buying it I was like thinking kenapa dia punya
kenapa orang nak kena ada promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
oh it's a good deal cause like macam
mum and my kakak ah
patutlah dia jual one for one
sebab dia punya specs tak guna
then I was like lepas tu dia cakap eh cause like
your degree naik or something right
is it just tak masuk akal to me
then my kakak cause my kakak was telling me ah that um celebrities who
share that dia orang beli their glasses from owndays like they keep on macam promoting owndays that means like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why macam a lot of
specs shop is dekat dalam the display then you have to like engage the
is on display everything at macam the racks then you just take and tak payah
like the the shop that I went to dia
dia dia dia dia I sound like I'm singing oh my god
while waiting for them to fix my kakak punya glasses
like berani gila
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because macam
they have to let the migrant workers work sebab of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
talking about apa nama dia um
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I masuk then I was like what is all these two faced people
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced macam
macam that
but then you only do a little like sikit
but like playing with stocks are like macam gambling ah
naik or turun
my nenek sheryl was sharing with me ah that like
so my mind is literally macam peanut
macam there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some merepek content
different tiktoks everyday kan macam like it like within
nanti it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and stuff like that and and like to reach out err to a bigger audience but macam
like I masuk also to tengok what people
no I masuk to tengok like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to macam
and when guys do that is like tak ada perempuan lain ke
like as in macam
like to me right it's like tak tahu malu ke like you already like cling onto like someone
try everyone else macam
macam like common ya
they are macam
suruh dia kahwin chef ah
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan
even if they don't have like long term macam five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel macam
they should have at least like a one year plan kalau tak macam
what you menganggur
oh I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it oh serahkan pada like allah and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your usaha man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
habis nanti like if if you say that
if you tegur them about it right nanti dia orang macam
the first time apa ah
who was like cause like his his profile he put there macam
I was like oh he is one eight one that's tall then I was like oo I'm going to talk to him sebab dia tinggi and then like I can finally wear heels if I date him
like atas sikit
macam like a higher angle you know
you know my dock marts punya sandals

ya so she love it so much she wants to belanja again so I was saying to her lah if you want to for your your ni wholesale I will take the same price as whatever I give lah
yang same price with every wholesaler lah
mm ah kau tahu aku mark up a bit only what she she said maybe not the time yet lah
ah ya lah cause dia ingat aku sorang
oh tak dia dia
dia ada duit cuma dia ingat nak nak collaborate pasal dress and baju dia macam tak berapa apa into it sangat kau faham tak
ah dia macam pernah try tapi tak berapa berjaya lah
tapi aku cakap aku ada partner kan so aku cakap kalau benda lain like maybe kalau aku nak combine dengan dia macam things like I'm not selling like jeans ke apa maybe I can go for that lah you get what I mean or not pasal ada sisters sisters yang lain pun they wanted to combine lah together something that is not I think like right now there's a lot of sellers who are selling this dresses and all that stuff right
um I suruh dia ah boss aku tu ah
how much is it ah babe how much is it how much per kotak
for harga harga for retail is it retail price is it
cause they don't want ah they want to be the same on par with the Malaysian punya apa orang kata commission
so maybe they are earning about two ringgit or per box or maybe four ringgit per box so Singapore also they will put that kind of price lah tak lebih sangat commission daripada you know Malaysian punya counterpart lah you know kalau tak jadi macam perbualan kan competition like that
dia nya size tu not even one palm
budak-budak makan tak cukup seh
mmhmm it's a healthier choice of uh air batu Malaysia kan
about four thousand three yes four thousand three hundred friend aku nya page aku nya page ada about uh six hundred
aku nya personal aku ada
two thousand over friend personal jer eh and then aku punya page aku ada two hundred
over lah two hundred forty four baru ah okay because it's a new page but
hello how many is my viewers aiyo like berapa less than dua puluh orang huh
I don't know lah what but then aku still bersyukur lah you know even though in on live memang tak tak banyak sales but after live off live is like orang will find me to ask lah you know is there any stocks
ah yes yes you know Nina Sazali pernah uh buat kan she show all her piles of dead buyers you know
ya cause dia dia punya she showed ah
it's been like two months now I'm still having like less than twenty viewers and that day yang si cousin aku tu first time live jer daripada shop yang tu jer dah macam
ada banyak juga terjual ah abaya dia dia buat abaya is like thirty eight dollars you know the abaya
aku tak I didn't watch uh I didn't watch the punya live sampai habis cause aku pun malas kan
ah aku memang I'm very moody ah on that last week I was very moody ah I was not on the what is it called on the I don't know I'm I was feeling down I was feeling down last week I don't know maybe cause of that negative punya experience you know
and then and then we had Aminah Muslim punya experience and then cousin aku punya campur aduk with the abaya stuff
ya the last yang four hundred dollars three hundred seventy seven some sort like that
she ya still got balance the last balance was three hundred over lah nak dekat four hundred so that was from her mother-in-law at last ah macam she like I don't know ah I I feel like she's like gali lubang apa tutup lubang eh abeh gali lagi
maybe ah babe you know what the the the punya tu is registered under her husband name of course lah mother-in-law dia tolong seh
and bo pian cause this one is a big money seh but I think eh dia dah scam orang lain dulu tau but I don't know lah aku try to search in Facebook about her background whatever kan so far nobody viral her you know why
kita punya barang or not you get what I mean or not
this thing will be like very sampai satu kali dia tak boleh bayar satu orang ni kan then I think the person will viral her
I don't know for me right cause she refunded us she got a lot of evidence nanti dia cakap dia ada evidence lah gedebak gedebuk lah you know but maybe ah kalau ada satu orang cakap anyone has any dealing with Aminah Muslim before muslimah before maybe I think a lot of people will comment
ya husnuzon lah mm
I mean ya I try but I'm not gonna order from her anymore the thing is I'm angry with her I'm quite upset cause she mentioned that I am dia punya regular customer which is which I my first time seh
how can you share a my conversation with another person saying that I'm to to to show that you are konon honest gitu lah kan
oh cause ah aku baca dia cakap nak kena uh only uh berapa percent jer melayu
no no melayu nak kena kurang daripada English actually
yes that's right so that's why you've been talking melayu all the way kan ah so you have to you cannot dia macam nak kena ada sixty percent of uh I think it's lower
so apa ni uh so that's why lah aku rasa macam
ah aku quite upset with her cause she you know she just mentioned my name without apa ni
suka suka cakap aku ni macam dia cover up her her her apa
ya cause she also mentioned to the person yang dia punya husband is not working for a few months already
the the one who sustain the business is the one yang dia scam kita you get what I mean or not
at times at times dia bukan kat situ at times bapa her father-in-law dia mother-in-law dia melayu
and laki dia melayu
uh huh dewa
ah all the Malay punya ni ah
mm so maybe she but but the person who uh the the refunded yang one K tu dia pergi dia dah pergi kedai dia
she was there but the second time that she came down it was the bapa mertua
ah yes so that's why she doesn't want to make a scene dia keluar daripada kedai tu dia tunggu si Aminah Muslim ni dekat dah lah aku tak tahu nama dia betul Aminah Muslim ke tak padahal dia put Aminah Muslim aje agaknya
and then after that dia apa ni uh she buy time again ah buy time
she doesn't even have actually supposedly that time she have to pay seven hundred okay sekali terus dia cakap ah I only have
ya lah she scam another person lah babe she go and advertise she say who want to buy wholesale then people like us macam aku will go and message her and then she will say oh minimum this kind of amount thirteen dollars per piece you know that kind of thing
then uh in fact um this Aminah Muslim right uh the the other the other party who was also scammed by her ah dia also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
the the Thai suppliers told her that Aminah Muslim tak order langsung
so which sources and then Aminah Muslim Aminah Muslim ni macam cakap uh please show me the message macam dia ada cakap buat apa aku nak show kau message tu seh
dia kena buku dengan ruas eh yang orang suka kaki viral eh she will get it ah confirm
that's why that's why macam kita have to apa orang kata ambil sikit-sikit ah cuma aku nak tahu juga si Lia tu dapat daripada mana ni
mm that one is a love your style that one is love your style dia punya Facebook
oo okay I saw the the advertisement also she have a few uh few uh apa ni baju which is the same
twenty five lah dia tu
mm I hope this one is true lah at least we have a you know direct supplier yang trustable lah you know
I already told her just give us uh new design you tell us lah cause malaysia punya boleh dapat lebih cepat apa
mm I'm not sure tapi tengok daripada Thai Thai punya supply juga I think
eh have you seen that patchwork that retro patchwork yang the baru punya retro marble ah
uh yang si Sadiah tu pun bawa and I saw a few others yang bawa
this it's it's pleated but it's the same like marble design but the colours are more glaring yang dia ni pun ada tunjuk aku Jenny ni dia ada tunjuk aku juga the colours lah but I I I feel like we already have the marble right right
ni pun tengok tengok ni lah babe tengok rezeki orang ah
ya ada yang big pleats ada yang smaller pleats
ada yang macam the quality yes ada yang termasuk
ya for me aku rasa yang macam ada tunic tu tunic is also considered as pleats kan tapi dia tak macam pleats sangat kau faham tak macam dia ada spread
ya cause I think the ruffle dress is pendek
just put it at Nina Sazali it will be a hot kicks lah for us habis lah
ah like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever I don't have that dream to to make it into a shop macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke I don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead kau nak kena ada manpower
macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa you know just on and as and when
ya so that's why for me when I do this um online thingy it's actually for for aku to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
yes true cause my kids are still small I I'm I'm also working in the morning you see so I don't see maybe like flea market I'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off punya event
but I think if you buy the garment kau tahu you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
berapa dah lima puluh ke kau eh fifty eh okay oh ya you're forty now ah
eh age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even Saadiah ah she said lah next year kita buka kedai lah I was like seriously
dia nak boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big ah you know like inside my heart oh no way I'm not gonna dream that big you know
but then again I I think that she is like what you know semangat lima minit kind of person
oh kucing ah oh okay cat fighting ya
okay so like like I said lah so I mean I'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but I'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like berkinja-kinja you know at the live she used my words like wanita lindungan kaabah all these you know and then but with me huh pening lah pening lah pening lah over here pening over there pening
the other one is the lady's punya ah um dia punya apa ni ah anak mmhmm
ya tak ada hati ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class meh cause I don't have any I got a condo maybe you get what I mean like for me lah never mind lah I mean we can find our own supplies I mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know memang we never come out with a lot of money lah but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can lah mm
one one person one person one who really wanted so I I already told her that one is the Saadiah punya friend ah she wanted to buy she messaged me just now
nanti barang tak datang and then after that people will chase us I don't like all these you know I don't want to drama drama
ya my my mother side a lot eh my mother nya auntie dia punya buat downline banyak seh eh I think eh this thing is very good lah sarah I mean I'm the one who eat it right
I'm not saying to promote my my item lah but then again I feel that this is good Roslan makan pun he can find energy ya
ya he took ah sarah eh dia kerja malam kan dalam pukul dua belas dia makan kan it can help him to survive until five baru rasa ngantuk
whatever lah I mean if you then then like that is personally lah from my own experience yang I'm having right now I can talk personally to people outside lah without putting it in my Facebook right
dia macam tak kasi aku apa macam maintain ah maintain maintain my weight so far lah aku dah cause dia kasi kita process kan kita punya toksin kan
I am I am anti weight machine punya orang I wouldn't even like want want to go up
babe my my auntie kurus nya pun diabetic before that also she like that sia also diabetic it doesn't matter is your the way you eat
but then again ya lah eh just now I cooked asparagus sedap seh that day I get a free asparagus I got asparagus I don't know from um a donation drive from my block
not lah Workers Party punya agaknya
oh wow your husband don't want you to be an influencer I mean I mean you know what when you do this kind of charitable work eh or you know like you make to save the earth save the frog save the animals you know that kind of thing save food you know I mean at the end of the day you're actually giving to um orang yang memerlukan the feeling of that to do this social work is very very apa orang kata ya it's very rewarding in fact it is
ya it takes two hands ah ya I mean but if you have a husband who is quite macam understanding that okay you're doing this for a good cause I mean he will let you go to do this it's good lah you know but I know that some people have different different perspectives of
marriage or you know how they want to control their partner lah or you can become the wanita lindung kaabah lindungan kaabah number three lah never mind lah redha redha
she will be in primary darjah dia baru darjah no darjah empat lah ah darjah it's primary four ya
kan so I don't I don't know ah it's very stress ah fikir kan ni semua
it is it is a must for me to change the school to Tampines cause it's better for her macam dia boleh rest after school cepat balik betul tak the Tampines north is very near to my house
so kalau dia dah balik sekolah dia terus boleh balik you know it's very tiring you primary school primary four abang will be in secondary school so by the time I think he will be home by what four four also now they all have extra extra activities after school right
mm mm mm so I really hope this is really stressing me up also stressing abang up abang doesn't look stressed but I look stressed he was like saying chill lah mak I can do it
tepuk eh tepuk
alright here we are today what's up talking via this audio recording dan juga di zoom recording err macam
kejap ah kau tahu kau punya audio recording apa ni ada there's another additional sounds
so aku tengok lah ada orang orang ni like there're influencers in itself so what happen is when aku tengok dia punya comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
err apa president the vice president
um I mean people have their own perspective and opinion lah but I think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
aku tak sangka that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like oh my god I can't believe this your statement I'm gonna unfollow you
ah itu kau boleh nampak different lah because
from that day onwards I'm sure si trump punya followers pun macam K I'm gonna unfollow you I'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear lah they just love to comments that's why I said there's a lot of them I'm like so surprised
and we just looking to apa ni um barang-barang yang kau boleh beli via Carousell
nak beli eh ya that's crazy man like
plan B lah but sometime good eh kalau kita orang sekarang kena berwawasan sikit
ah macam dia lah dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia very determined eh tak malu ah so this kind of people actually it's good for err business lah actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
uh so I think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he siasat dia punya prime suspect
ya jangan tidur jangan tidur
sabar sama sama so semalam aku knockout then I just bangun balik perasan it's really really damn good movie
ya so kalau korang ingat back in the days err maybe in nineties
kalau korang tengok the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them lah so siapa-siapa try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
so yang dia mati tu eventually it's there's another plot twist lah all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat
apa lagi ya
the nun definitely mata kau buka besar-besar ah
aku lagi cerita yang buat kau thrilled terperanjat untuk kau macam watch all the way yes of course
apa lagi satu eh
there's err conjuring annabelle ada kena mengena kan
oh geram
tu wah rembat tu get so emotional rich
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya err wife remarried so he's not happy go and killed both of them
I think in is not something new ah because before that dia ada tunjukkan eh err lot of accidents or orang gaduh eh gaduh all this
so this man doesn't let her off easily ah kan surrounded with dekat orang gaduh kan so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something kadangkala macam tu tak make sense aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini like kata orang dah you are negative by itself so the banyak amarah yang belum unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing
so he escalated the matter by killing by killing did he ah he killed he killed some of this lady punya
kau pakai earpiece
okay tak nampak ah sekali tak eh
eh kau cerita lah
siapa they met a guy kat reunion
mm mm kan gared gared is the ni mm
I think tu bukan secretary itu attorney also
just pasal dia like junior
to the ni the main err ni lah
so kesian
not bad though that's not bad at all the efforts are um a bit sceptical about it nanti bila tunggu lama sikit
pasal ah kita dah benchmark eh kita dah tengok movie banyak sangat
second mesti ada subtitles because I tend to tak tak I kita tengok macam like where's the subtitle yo and how am I going to understand these they speaking english with slangs and very thick accent ya
five minutes of the says is important so say wrong buat semua terkeliru eh kuat sangat lah kutuk trailer
what else that we do err today oh kita ordered nasi ambeng eh
ah nasi ambeng dia adalah dari sebuah kedai ni
err ya not bad lah err like fifty bucks for two to three pax and then like the entire dulang
uh huh paru sambal goreng
kalau sayur tu kurang least favourite bukan pasal tak suka sayur apa tapi dia tak berapa lembut
ah masak sayur jadi lembut sikit eh
what else did we did today err we'd like to cover ourself with a lot of selimut selimut
selimut bukan semut K in case kau tak dengar so siapa yang tak dengar ni selimut S E L I M U T
ya hujan
hujan pun later started
camera is sleeping and my husband like bedek lah ni bedek dia ni tak kelip mata tak buat apa-apa dia diam jer
but then aku tengok macam makin aku naik makin dia punya tank makin apa dia makin pendek
ya aku ingatlah towards sana lead to somewhere else but no I'm going actually if I didn't end it I'm gonna get myself eaten by the crocodile oh my god crazy you got my adventurous in another way ya
primary four kot that time chill lagi anak-anak kecil ya
anak-anak headache
apa maksud engkau dengan tak berapa takut dengan crocodile
dan kau cakap kalau dia jump macam mana ah jadi aku berwaspada
err aku
I would rather follow the makcik-makcik rombongan you know they just saw take pictures
we saw the makcik eh in the botanical garden
some rabak ah rabak gila ah
monkey mengamuk monyet mengamuk teruk bro
aku belum nampak or tahu satu but aku tahu member guna sepak slap on the face
ya monkey monyet but tu dia same monkey business monyet
ada aku suka yang kecil lah maybe the baby one are cute and friendly and and playful
selamat monyet tu kurang bijak ke tahap that dia tak buka water bottle tu dia tengok takde air dia campak kau balik
ah tapi actually masa dekat bridge tu ni monyet ni dia ada agenda aku dah nampak daripada mata dia
like you better shut dia macam fine lah you better shut up when we're not going to say anything I'm going to jump on her bag I say okay alright go ahead
yes eventually they jump there's err grab a bottle from you lepas aku cakap I tahu kenapa but yang that err he very sneaky and he just noise trying to communicate to me the moment he hop on your bag but he look at me again
aku macam okay bro yo no monkey business
and happily they keep proper padahal air takde air kosong
atau kau just
kurang ajar punya monyet eh
ah nak kasi kasi betul-betul lah
aiyo so crazy oh so now kita nak kena bawa kayu eh to frighten them ah
ah singapore ni monkey kayu jalan weh tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik
oh ya man no kangaroo I got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to macam kasi makan
but I didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me mampus sia ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like uh we bought quite a bit ah tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan seh like we bought like two two or one eh I don't remember
get fed by us ah the the time ah and then ada kasi makanan dia apa so at the end kita kasi dengan
birds and ni kan the ducks
they them datang ah
that's definitely but my um in my thought is like kalau pasal kita balik like
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always nasib kalau kena tak kena but I think this is gonna go higher because they are
we all know COVID is not easy thing for those who kena
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government punya you know command
how how do I put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time macam
kau tahu benda ni dah badly affected and I think when we talk about ke apa kan
ya tapi aku rasa
I don't see that we are macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena push in so macam
atau it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online lah kan
ya there the other thing is your kerja jalan lah unless kau kena micromanaged by your own company ah so
ya man yo so kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit eh lima belas minit ah
and those are not definitely feel macam ah you know I mean
that's not easy you know especially for a pengantin ah
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and err ramai meriahkan wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap I felt that that's how it is lah
unless unless you no need to macam invite people dia macam immediate family kau nak totally buat kecil-kecil just make sure everything sah then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then I think is not the time yet lah kalau kau betul wedding kau grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't lah not the time yet
kalau korang just sebab ada mum is there then just go ahead lah
ya I think kalau cakap sah ni and dia pun ada the elderly lah
so pasal kalau keluar kan orang wear mask kan and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
because that's their main entertainment like kalau dulu kan kita keluar I think they always go out go where pasar geylang ah
ah little india or wherever a shopping mall ke or visiting the bazaar ke ah membawang kan
mengopi lah mengumpat lah whatever lah sekarang stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
okay cerita lama okay

so kalau tak kesah ah kalau it's not practical
okay like maybe first would be I want the bank account that will like refresh itself tau tak dia tak err like I don't need to put duit inside lah biar dia biar pakai jer refresh to the original amount so kalau macam gitu err I don't need like a lot of money I just have enough money but enough is good jadi like tak sombong gitu ah
top up ah top up tapi bukan kita yang top up ah
uh tak tahu siapa yang top up ah tapi terima kasih jer
nak kahwin oh tapi that's your first wish tu mesti mesti ada boyfriend dulu ah
terus suami eh takde boyfriend tapi now you got boyfriend right
tapi korang ada pernah macam uh fight ke apa ke
so far belum ah mm okay tapi sekarang kan
sekarang kan macam COVID kan so cannot really meet each other that much apa
oh but how frequently tu
but like for me I remember bila I was dating kan uh we meet everyday sebab sama sekolah apa so kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama in the weekends so hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka so bila kahwin I also know that takkan jelak ah
tak serik ah tapi okay ah dah dah come on ah dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu should be fine lah kan
eh panggil dia apa makcik cik
apa-apa jer jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia
oh tapi dah it's like coincidence ke atau memang nak jumpa dia
bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau like atau tak kasi dia jumpa you
oh ya ya ya oh dia tak tahu
mak dia jer tahu ah
oh asal dia tak bilang
ya macam why he why he like want to like keep it secret seh
okay so do you guys like macam
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then kalau like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know ah middle chair honestly I don't know
problem with that so far takde lah
bagus lah K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
oh eh apa bara api tu scary juga tu nanti kalau like if one of you all like marah habis sia dua-dua volcano seh
so like your chinese one your you you're what ah tiger right ya tiger memang ah
macam a'ah bara api gitu tiger fierce
tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa so baru tiga bulan so you don't know lah like
cause for me and my husband kalau kita kita dah jumpa everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months kita macam dah tahu each other gitu ah so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
fight that okay I did something wrong then kita orang cakap ah kita mesti cakap ah like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys dia sekarang sekolah right so he berapa tahun lagi eh
oh he's just a normal lah bukan honours lah
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years gitu
mm four years so dia macam
okay dia start dia belajar apa
gitu-gitu ah
oh first year already tak surviving oh rabak hancur seh
exam exam ah okay so dia sekarang end of the first year
if he pergi counselling the course counselling he might have to restart lah
three four more years with something you don't like kan lagi exams means you have to study for it
tu ah and he's still so young he's like what twenty five kan so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter ah ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then lagi rabak then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
I think macam dia kena fikir betul-betul lah kalau dia kalau dia nak continue ke atau dia nak
like tukar ke because like one year is still okay tapi bila dah two years gitu kan then I think that's when it's err there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay lah kalau nak tukar right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like kalau in in so actually kalau some people right they will uh come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first sebab lagi senang but you waste one year lah but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
uh uh so like macam gitu pun boleh lah kalau if you want because a lot of people kat poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like err some course that they don't like like engineering gitu then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma yang dorang nak and then after dorang masuk then they get to go ah so it for them is like um ya you you sacrifice one year ah to do what you want then so you can think of it like that gitu
okay so dia dah tapi dia electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff asal dia tak pergi digipen
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then kalau tak boleh you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best lah
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for ada tau art design on media that one at least ah there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
ya so like macam my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that one that time [kan] she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want lah so eh I mean I feel like
um I'm okay tapi I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so macam I felt like I needed to work or at least do something ah like not school for once gitu
ya pretty much even though like kat uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff tapi then I went back so ya then I think
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right um what I heard from my classmates ah yang dah dorang bekerja kan then dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun ah at the most sepuluh tahun gitu then dorang come back to like get just get a degree dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis like an essay like how to write essay all that dorang dah lupa
ya so um that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it gitu
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words apa
berapa tahun eh berapa tahun
oh satu eh
so kalau you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
lepas kahwin betul-betul nak kahwin dulu eh
oh is there a reason why you want to like kahwin first
um in terms of stress kan lepas kahwin eh you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I kahwin and then lepas tu like I felt very
um stressed out sebab like nak our our mum she ah she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and ayah decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking gitu so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
tapi takde apa-apa ah because ah kalau orang tanya pun I will just say oh my husband he's okay with apa so in the end religiously uh culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think ah so
kau siapa seh
so my suami is super like easy going dia faham everything I'm very honest to him
kalau I'm going to this place ke apa I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him lah I'm going to overnight kat tempat ni with my friends we just wanna chill kalau nak ikut ikut ah like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so kalau dia nak keluar ke apa with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding lah so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
kahwin ya
ya betul lah
tu ah
then macam I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
malangnya I think you want like my kind of wedding
ulam seh kampung kat mana ni kampung apa malaysia
pulau ubin dorang nak tutup apa
semakau pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi
kalau nak pergi kat malaysia kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana
ah tak rapat ah tapi ada lah ada tu ada lah
filter kau block yourself you block yourself you know
kau block sendiri but then the rental will be insane
ah betul lah uh then mm pulau ubin is actually quite interesting for a wedding
like like are they chinese ke malay ke oh
takde motor takde kereta ah bagus kau
dia jemput jer semua orang tapi actually tak jemput semua orang indirectly lah
orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat west kat east east so dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang uh yang uh um uh kat tuas situ kat johor masuk masuk ah johor masuk tapi kalau kau orang uh tampines pasir ris tak payah datang sudah waste your time
so dorang kat sana kat mana dorang the majlis kat mana
is like you only go there kalau nak show off
kan like if you just want to show off cakap like you like you got a lot of money then okay lah sentosa lah but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore yang you can actually get
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money gitu
uh tapi ada timer ah dah reach dah reach harbourfront okay habis wedding habis
uh uh uh unless if unless if like you ah ambil the cruise ship yang pergi batam and back ah then okay got time tapi ada cruise yang sekarang they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back lah so kalau macam gitu susah sikit ah
and orang tak boleh datang like wherever they want they have to come bila bila cruise dia dah nak ship off gitu ah
a'ah ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil lah sampan kau bawa sampan kau kelakar seh nanti dorang dayung sampan
alamak susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah
I think at night lah we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then bila dah malam kan then we say oh uh all the makcik pergi tidur and stuff and then terus we got to the club and then terus
so you went with adik
buffet jer buffet lah buffet dia halal lah
oh chilli crab pun ada
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones yang macam the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go ah even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like um
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like eh is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so rabak so I didn't even K I didn't even like
uh uh but okay lah it was fun lah it was for once you get to feel like macam orang kaya gitu uh tapi like ya that's it lah but I don't know lah like
kalau korang nak um pergi staycation ke tak
I know the kalau if the d'kranji here is
clean certified clean certified then maybe kita boleh pergi sana
cause there is like very secluded kan so it's a different experience gitu like out of city life
uh tapi I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
uh you and me will have this share the room and then he and abang hafiz will share lah
uh so kita halalkan lah
oh so susah tu but no if they like
uh uh a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause kalau if it's two hafizes I mean both tak boleh seh
uh uh so I think macam okay lah like we we can do that but it depends ah like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away tu ah
mm january gitu okay
ya lah but I mean okay lah we can we can always go tapi the thing is like you said ah must plan lah ya
oh ya the one you told me yang dia
I mean dorang pun macam orang melayu lah you have to understand lah kita orang pun macam everything also macam relax apa
tak ikut sangat ah but
ya so I feel like macam
macam gitu it will be really susah for them to
and indonesia pun teruk teruk seh
like indonesia is teruk
kalau tengok dia punya cases
ah betul
indonesia is also like quite high death rate kan death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else gitu
so this is very scary ah like lagi dorang pun I don't think they care then they are so dense gitu the the country
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures kan err then err but for them dorang tak ada pun I mean kita bila we needed the extra space terus kita pergi tukar expo lah tukar all the places that we already have tapi tak pakai apa because COVID kan so we use that place to um immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
tapi kalau indonesia I think susah because kan singapore kan kita kan asyik kiasu kan kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau indonesia semua relax
dorang relax jer kita kan kiasu everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
mm uh dorang pun macam kalau mati mati lah dah sakit that's their thinking ah dah sakit apa sakit so kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi
so dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu ah dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh uh manage kan all these things ah so it's very hard for them ah like india also is very very very bad
ya ya ya yang teruknya kan a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour ah saying that it's
a'ah but like I feel like it's somewhat true because dorang really tak kesah for the for the old people
ah then like dorang macam they will only like take in like patients yang have a chance of survival
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like dulu punya america
ya during um last time when america was quite bad kan I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so macam kesian ah but in india it's like that every day now
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more tapi they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang uh yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan like
don't mess lah don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that tu kan
ya tapi orang-orang tua dorang kan uh tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal lah kan kita orang dah cakap pakai mask and jangan uh jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang kan kalau nak keluar keluar lah apa nak jadi
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so macam um there was this atuk not atuk ah pek in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like oh no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
like we will just like huh like what what are we supposed to do you know ah but like kita tak boleh buat apa-apa cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
orang tak suka pakai mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
ah pek together kadang-kadang more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk macam biasa lah macam tak ada COVID gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang just biarkan jer ah
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do lah dia dah dia dah like bored lah I think
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there dorang tak tengok pun tau kalau kalau kau scan ke kau tak scan ke dorang just masuk dia kasi masuk jer dorang tak kesah kan ya so it's like it's so like uh jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay lah singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not ah I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
um but because everyone has to wear mask so tak tak boleh buat apa-apa so it's that's why tak ada macam transmission not so much of transmission ah ya
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that kan so err it's it's like already in our we already know you know like um the social way to like macam social responsibility lah ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause dah berapa lama seh dah berapa bulan going to one year I feel
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here sebab kan kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain is like wow betul-betul rabak like but kat singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker punya time that time bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus seh ya
with soap like dulu kan siapa nak cuci tangan dengan soap I ask you like tak ada seh all the aunty ah wash hand only wash water can already lah dorang memang mesti tak pakai soap punya mana ada pakai soap seh
now now they don't now they're like ah ya kalau tak wash nanti eh you never wash you never like use the soap ah then lepas tu baru dorang
you you really pakai the soap ya
good things comes of it uh come out from it lah ya ya ya betul lah like I think it's um inevitable lah like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
so the toilets are generally cleaner ah so like okay ah it's not bad ah um mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown kan and know france kan dah second lockdown
ya rather than macam kat sweden where it's like free and easy and then wow the death rates are like crazy seh
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad kat japan lah so dorang kena mula balik ah everything lah have to go back the mask and all that err I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff lah ya I think everywhere is still quite bad eh but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden kan kesian seh
tapi for me I kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat seoul garden sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu ah tu ah macam kesian seh ah nasib baik dia pergi doctor
ah naisb baik dia pergi doctor then lepas tu you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya ah tu ah so
I mean I think kesian ah macam he got more hate than
what he should have gotten gitu ya
no dorang three tables uh
so there were still like macam bergroup tapi err it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around lah macam kadang-kadang dorang mix like you sit here I sit there ke apa mix food err so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the um the fear that they have lah
ya so kesian ah
and dia dia sakit kan dia pergi doctor then bila dah kena COVID and the check up oh at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed lah the rules and stuff kat sini seoul garden ah if me I think I wouldn't say so much seh I diam diam jer tak lah but like I feel like macam why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already kan ya so I feel like um he's actually good part ah for him to be really responsible also
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended err people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like apa seh
like what the hell does that even mean gitu uh uh so I I was like wow this prime minister really wants to like err reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
uh uh I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you makan then I'm like but it's so like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so err ya macam gitu like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it ah bagus ah dorang habis ah a'ah tu ah like macam it's
ya ya ya he's just like ah give up lah dah mengaku kalah
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to macam err cheer up the community gitu um it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time lah
then macam ah nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay
oh in Australia belajar macam basics like Mathematics English
err habis tu I also belajar macam
oo my most favorite ah is definitely um belajar apa ni Law because it's very interesting lah like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's uh it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn
dalam err Singapore punya education I mean secondary school punya subject
ya I feel I feel you macam susah nak nak part dengan family kan
eh uh the dalam sekolah you do you do macam any
ya floorball is fun I last time before I pindah to Australia I was also in a floorball team
tak fair
hopefully lah maybe you can try next year you know never know your kau punya chance kan
huh biar betul
wah I've never heard before eh I thought you only can join like you know your only your faculty punya apa tu punya wah I didn't know you can actually do that
oh um sekarang I tengah ambil apa ni interaction design so not a lot of people know about this course because like my school is like the only school yang ada this course
um basically kat dalam course ni I do macam coding dengan design it's a very
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now macam um banyak benda is like about technology kan so ya I feel like this course uh actually benefit me lah in the future
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak uh brainstorm ideas uh for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so uh for you ah you said you were in like um marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
then uh uh besides sekolah kan like what what do you like to do macam do you have macam other hobby ke or apa apa benda lah
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school pastu ada apa O level abeh stress takle fikir yeah
oh during my free time I suka
uh macam uh draw I also like to err tengok apa ni
ah anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because takde time kan poly dalam I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to uh do my hobbies which is kind of uh macam sedih but yeah so
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
but um I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then um maybe in uh um year two then I will start macam join like start trying out for ah I've actually picked
macam a few is err firstly is ah floorball like um aku kata tadi kan as I've mentioned uh floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
ya it is it is that's why macam I'm like a bit takut to um you know join their team because err macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
but I think right I think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
oh mesti sakit eh
then the the surgery bila
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia dia kata like
um it's actually not that painful lah because like you know they put you in uh on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think ah after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects kan so ya
how how how would you feel like macam you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like macam like your feeling
uh I've never I've never apa ni had any surgeries before
I can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit
tak lah I never say
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause ah
apa ni I I love doing calligraphy right so I like macam I have I have like a mini business where
I uh buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like um quite a reasonable price lah so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
uh I like aiya basically like um doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people kan you know singaporeans kan diorang suka macam study kan then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
kan sekarang COVID kan so like uh kat dalam rumah what do you do
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also macam a good way lah for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam COVID kan
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border dah buka then we can go
after macam this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is uh mana ni Japan
I've been there bila when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so macam tak ingat uh I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also macam if it's like an interesting country ah macam menarik you know pasal
like because uh I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap ah so I was like okay ah then I I think if if cause I like to collect
the the work is macam due next week kan then I would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
always use my I'm on my handphone asyik tengok Instagram semua then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like oh dah lambat ah just tidur lah besok boleh buat
macam like group projects eh
oh recently I I ada macam this one err group project like I just finished macam err dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because uh
so my group kita buat we did this uh macam is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time ah pakai then it's like susah ah then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting ah so like when users uh see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next uh page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
Animal Crossing is a very in game now eh a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main ah then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
macam look forward to ah
wah that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
yeah it's good also because like kan year three we ada internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for um untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but I didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so I think macam it's quite it's quite beneficial lah like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
I also had like a similar a similar module I did apa ni uh previously
where also same it's called uh effective effective err communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know err if err communicate effectively and how to like you know gain uh confidence
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting ah but macam sedih ah because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me ah from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who err is uh confident enough ah to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
and macam it's like quite cool lah because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me err there's this macam ada this uh girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like eh I heard you're in the in the same course
then uh she's like uh let's be friends ah then from there uh we started being friends ah then err when during poly because err mostly it was on Zoom right because of macam this COVID situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so err ya then err in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy lah in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing macam susah is that uh is like the modules ah because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never macam done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
oh I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
macam the badge gitu so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift one ah so it's not bad ah tapi panas gila
and the and the worst thing kan towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like eh nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal lah my then my friend dah tak boleh take it kan then she was like ah batal jer lah
eight hours was uh painful lah then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of Tampines ya but it was very very rewarding pasal uh at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
huh biar betul
kay lah not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside lah donate also
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
penat I couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade kan already dah ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa ah kita stand
under the hot sun then collect lor but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like alamak shouldn't have told them
ya true hopefully lah I I I really wish macam this COVID situation will macam die down ah because it really affects ah kita punya life
a'ah so kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap like in both like melayu dengan english so boleh tak
okay maybe kita nak cakap pasal like kita punya favourite show boleh tak
oh movie apa
wait like buta like like how buta hati atau like you know
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like kenapa dia buta
tak senonoh then after that
wait tapi the guy know yang like like
the guy is dia apa tu yang punca yang the girl punya
lelaki tu wah
memang macam like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya lah but like macam it's so coincidental you know like macam the girl dengan the guy is like
kedai ya
but macam it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think kena tengok right
your abang is my adik
I think it's kind of takde lagi is it
pasal dia ya dia orang dah remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like perempuan you know like the girls and then like eh like macam like when I watch it I was like oh my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know uh macam baca buku all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then lepas tu like
then lepas tu he I think dia orang ada like sepuluh seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai like dia orang like tiga puluh lebih and until like
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you tengok like macam dia orang like grow to become like a better person
so macam damn cool because I also because like dulu kan macam banyak orang ingatkan like orang yang suka science semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil like very awkward right like they feel like they macam cannot fit into the society
socially less awkward and also because like macam if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
because like I remember one episode kan like macam young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy nama sheldon
school like not really a professor lah by research scientists and then lepas tu like um banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh fit in
but then over the years apa dia dia dia cuba like fit in to like parties macam because ada seorang perempuan popular ni neighbour dia
kan and then like um dia like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then lepas tu they will they will feeling very awkward because dia orang dia orang like cuba to interact with like the rest
ya dia orang semua ingatkan dia weird sebab like dia datang pun like dengan baju tak senonoh
until the party and cannot fit in lah but then lepas tu then he realise that oh my god
apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok show ni daripada kecil call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing lah because like dia dia dia pun like was single all the way then lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan ah kahwin then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then tak he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that um apa tu to like
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise betul tak like he cannot like
ya so they actually show us yang macam love
terus jump to it
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast kan dia orang carry macam opposite of each other
ya so dia orang cuddle cuddle dia macam like eh let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu then like
oh because you pakai like all the duit birthday for all this
I know you said you show me the photos mah and then macam it's damn nice what
no lah but waffle kan macam murah takkan they will charge you lah
okay but haji lane is overpriced sebab tu lah you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually murah ya but it's at where somerset
that means like macam kalau they are not like at the central area of singapore kan it's usually cheaper
ya lah that's why it's cheaper lah kalau if it if it's at town right confirm mahal
what no lah but tu untuk buka like cafe in singapore quite
so you become like ibu
design the place itself kan macam they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
it's not it's very mahal and like ya
it's like macam you know like we we it's like our like previous kedai lor
ya it's like you need to know makanan apa sedap and then like sometimes kan you hire the chef and the dia tak tahu masak
no but actually makanan tak sedap pun tak apa tau cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like macam it's cool lah like
you know like your makanan K cause your makanan tak sedap kan at least your coffee sedap or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
ya ya lah you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee macam tak ada gula
ya like takde gula is like totally fine with me ya
actually I want to ask you kan macam like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts um if you have like tiga like wish that you wanna wanna
ya like okay like kalau tak ada macam K if like there's no boundaries because you know like macam you tengok aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like oh I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like kan like duit apa tu apa tu it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar kan tak fun
cause like I feel like I'm macam sangat lost
there's too many like macam like direction that you can go like because you imagine kalau you stay in malaysia then like ya tak banyak ya like I think you will only get like
like kan siapa like most people will go either retail and then like or office world lah because in singapore we kita kita believe in like equality right
so that's why I like I like the so for me macam like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working kan like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
even though I know it pays well like gaji besar but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's penat and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay lah maybe you kalau you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start macam betul susah
ya bukan like the
ya cause you know like if you go jakarta like I don't know you wait did go batam ya you went batam before right and you know like macam some places are very crowded then you know they don't care one ya
they do though because that time I went national gallery then dia orang semua duduk dekat
ah dia orang semua loiter dekat you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then lepas tu the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then kena pekik sia they were like oi is you new like why
and then lepas tu the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend lah then I was like oh my god what's this maid doing ah
ya I tak kisah so I just like walk away and then lepas tu they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
tapi like
you are just lucky cause like in singapore macam even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
ya so we all ya I think singapore bagi kita like money to like spend for all these trips sia so I think it's like I think that's a good thing eh
dia sounds like internship kan then I was like wah
ya macam like people from korea guam that's why
macam like banyak orang that like
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business macam it's easy to
okay lah it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like macam I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
you should go with afal adik
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know macam tempat
tak bersih sangat lah also it's okay ya ya they don't care one
science kau ah
kak ya you know inshira right she's working like so called full time in nurse
who's kak epah
kak malinah that one is
ya oh tapi K takpe kita boleh masa baru
oh I see semua busy
ya but I used to be sociable but then I realize like eh okay because maybe I tak I think I know why cause you tak you've not enough money
bagi set aside budget berapa like berapa duit
wah lama sia
oh you nenek say that
mahal is it
like cheese I don't understand yes ibu also don't like but ibu okay with it you know why
I setuju oh you ramen
no ask kakak to help you lah
like selamat datang ke podcast saya
ya but I don't think macam like podcast kan ada
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why bapa all listening to podcast now
ya I know what you mean like macam but for me right if I clean I'll be happy
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic permulaan
okay I don't know what happen I was at home tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan as usual cari air then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the kranji resort ni macam cantik let's all go stay for holiday gitu ah satu three day two night something like that
no she just ask like korang nak pergi farm stay tak I initially said no because it's at kranji and I always told her like nanti sana ada momok
I think so ya dia dekat dengan sungei buloh all the way sia I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday um I went to research more lah like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown abeh macam tak ada makanan and stuff like that ah
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue nya barang barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november kan the review was on sixteen november just two days before
huh sekarang hotel tengah macam staycation package gitu kan
baru keluar eh ah later I go check
I ask mama what about snow city because it's the nearest to our house and we have never been there before so might as well pergi sana mama kata tak pernah nampak snow that time she went to bugger she just saw like one to three ah sikit gitu jer
yes it was a son of a peach then lepas tu I share with mama then mama was like eh tu dekat dengan apa rumahnya mak punya rumah kan tu is it the new house is it
tu mama dah start dia punya
oh yang block one two eight eh
boleh lah dah terlanjur
wow was this like during the time of the makcik keropok yang datang rumah abeh orang semua macam
oh no makcik keropok was much later I think was in that time
makcik keropok has been going around for quite long ah I don't know when we moved to our house dekat clementi kan think I was in uni that time then there was this bibik indonesian who tengah jual keropok and then it was I think malam lah macam lapan lepas maghrib bibik tu ketuk pintu abeh tanya nak jual keropok
then mama tengah kat living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like adik adik then the bibik kasihan tau the bibik was like saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu
then I was like I alamak mak aku tak baik seh dia terus panic gabrah depan depan bibik tu but I ended up buying a few keropok lah cause kasihan
ee bacin
lepas renovation hopefully dah okay lah tapi nak kena hack balik ah takut pijat-pijat bau takpe bau will go away but it's the pijat that maybe can come back
kat dalam-dalam ah
like really people who really don't know how to take care of their things actually like time beli rumah time tengok-tengok rumah your parents didn't know they have twenty cats inside the room
mm agaknya eh
tengah renovation ke
alamak okay lah tak lah nanti kalau kita bebual nanti tak dengar sangat
I tried linkedin I tried um my careers future which is tak bagus tak guna punya
or like macam singtel you know government related jobs ya and then um the the the macam amount of jobs kat situ tak banyak sangat lah kat my career future so I tried also the other one which is job street lah job street has the most but job street is mostly recruit recruiters ah or even if they have job like macam they call me back dia punya job dekat east side dekat loyang because I do supply chain mah so a bit too far for me lah
tak ada the good thing is like macam I attended all these itu job fairs and all these job fairs err there will be someone who will call me back and ask me if um anything positive come out of the the the job fair macam ada interview ke tak then I will just let them know that ada ke tak which I will always say none I attended follow back with me follow up with me on any interviews or what then they said okay never mind will still continue to search for you
eh tak tahu I will try
okay lah sekarang job market macam gitu so I'm just waiting for twenty twenty one ah for things to be better
itu jer so sad
oh so now he's only the only one stuck there but his family dah balik sini lah
sana tak ada macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the changi punya restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
when the news came out she ask me adik do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama nak try makan first class tak pernah duduk alah tak boleh fly kan duduk kat dalam aeroplane dapat makan pun jadi lah gitu so I told mama for the price that you pay ah I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
I remember like I I did say that out um mama did say that she want me to macam take them go jalan-jalan lain kali daya bawa pula lah because like the last time she went japan macam korang bawa dia kan so she said to me lain kali daya bawa lah kita jalan-jalan so I told mama
cara I jalan-jalan later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
but penat seh masa tu kita pergi japan banyak jalan so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
sedap but the sedap is what the cook is malaysian cook ah or japanese cook
I never try nasi lemak on airplane before
things to note nak kena try nasi lemak kat silk air important question nak fly tu bila tu aiya I hope they can find a cure for this COVID seh
betul punya travel bubble eh from one island to another island
oh ya a'ah orang semua nak balik negeri
dah relax dah kan
oh dah thirty minutes already
a'ah still a lot of things juga
eh then they hack it out then outside is what kosong jer oh
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually macam reject reject punya kalau orang tak suka the areas ah the units ah
ah atas tong sampah gitu ah ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya fengshui tak bagus ke yang at least the good thing is tak ada momok ah kalau resale kan
yang tengah yang tengah have lah tengah have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also macam cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app tu kan so people who live in like edgefield plains kat kawasan sengkang they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya ah macam kau masuk terus dah siap
I want like macam cement floor macam gini kan macam cement floor
it look like macam cement gitu like concrete gitu
so I was thinking of something like this lah macam yang penting colour grey bawah tu look a bit like cement
korang ada skirting tak kita letak skirting juga lah
because I was thinking that kalau if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm nanti bawa pluto sekali lah so I also think about oh if you want to have a house nanti pluto need her own cat tree lah you need to catify the house semua kan
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation abeh rumah dia macam minimalist gitu and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like macam have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
ye lah si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau jer now the kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek so that's why I'm thinking like that ah tak payah lah beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu simple simple then IKEA kan macam batau furniture then after five years can throw already
they katuk very fast eh
a lot of macam renovation company mcam dorang katuk very fast
oi kejapnya dah rosak
hood jatuh
oh ah reno talk bagus ya ya
I was actually looking at counter tops semalam cause I had berangan nak okay nak macam kayu punya butcher countertop pastu kan cement floor gini kan and then dia punya ah tempat cabinet dia colour putih gitu so I was thinking oh very nice colour putih macam a bit rustic sikit butcher block then sekali when I read about the butcher block is literally just a chopping board so nak kena letak mineral oil semua nak kena maintain tu yang leceh
oh macam boleh buat back splash terus gitu eh
wow tak pernah dengar ni vulcan
nak kena wax tak atau sealing ke apa
entah she tak mention apa she just said that ah nanti kalau singgah sheng siong bilang eh
betul but I'm not going to go sheng siong I'm going to go daiso but I don't know I think jcube got one daiso
padahal dekat but still uh need to walk further
choa chu kang nya dah siap
COVID happened kau nak kena bagi chance dekat dorang
but it's near to mama and papa so when I'm malas to cook I can just walk over
ah mama actually said that she say kau jangan pergi dekat tu sengkang jauh-jauh ni kau dekat-dekat jer dari lah dekat clementi resale pun tak apa
buruk-buruk one
ah then dah buat ni semua aiya tak payah pindah
ya lah tak payah pindah stay there for what at most also you just need to renovate the room that taufik has been using to keep his things did you see the canvas I saw a lot of like shoes they use the small rooms they change it to like a home office with like a see through glass it's very nice
true lah singapore susah nak cari yang perfect perfect
a'ah seh kasihan your neighbour only got one plant and then korang letak banyak-banyak
pokok hang dia satu jer tanam lah pokok-pokok hang banyak sikit
actually good lah the jiran that's okay tu pun susah nak dapat
oh dorang alternate kan
try teaching ah macam mana nak teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
oh okay okay okay faham faham
that's why I really macam tabik ah those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan parent layankan principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar
yang kat luar tu semua habis ah pecah-pecah
eh bijak eh dia bijak
tu lah kalau anak saudara sendiri okay tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds kalau anak saudara at least the values are still similar you know kalau budak tu ada problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
dah hafal script ah gitu
for me tuition was different okay like macam I know that the syllabus are ajar macam gini kan but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different macam not say education level like macam tahap kefahaman dorang is different so macam maybe in class the teacher already dah start on algebra but the kids punya foundation is still very weak so although dorang dah sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still macam at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting lah for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching ah ada budak macam they really need ah physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think macam is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all kan
they will be like apa tu one kenapa one kenapa one plus one kenapa tak boleh one and that kind of thing
actually it's not that hard I realise okay lah because for me um I teach budget tuition and I teach orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam more or less macam ah relax jer kau datang class kan dia kasi epok-epok lah dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
tu dorang punya um general generally lah most of them dorang punya mindset is like that there are a few macam one or two who come and they say like oh I want my kids to get A padahal the kid is already a B student so for me macam when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid dah interested in learning automatic terus dorang A sendiri so jadi tak stress macam gitu
yang stress is when you haven't start the parent macam ah kepoh kepoh lah like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid ah macam gitu tu leceh sikit
ajar budak-budak madrasah ah madrasah kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school punya how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some makcik like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because madrasah under private school kan
okay what al al-irsyad ah eh but al-irsyad susah nak masuk eh
sekolah tahfiz ah
eh but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from madrasah like oh my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
okay mah tak salah pe but I notice this trend tau macam my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education wah they really start planning the education route early on baby masih dalam perut dah planning tau nak hantar childcare ni lepas umur ni pergi this school nanti pastu hantar ni
macam we all orang biasa relax ah pergi sekolah good enough already ah
as an adult I wanted to be a farmer I apply kat kok fah kena reject seh sedih
okay hari ini I went to bath and body works
I went to apa itu to err the dia punya outlet dekat takashimaya sebab I nak beli dia punya err scented candle
ya black friday hari ini
but it's very it's a very it's I'm very disappointed lah because dia punya sale kan
patutnya hari ini banyak um barang-barang kan tapi like semua macam sudah run out macam like the day before dia orang dia orang had a sale
tak best ah tahun ini tak best
you know I went to three one three then after that err tengok-tengok baju tapi so macam they say the price is lowered tapi macam it's still expensive you know
ya semua tempat pergi semua crowded
ya really and then tak payah keluar tak payah queue semua
just now um I was lucky lah because I thought they had this early bird sale and everything then I tunggu pukul sembilan pagi all the way till eleven plus masih belum buka
tak macam dia punya sale on black friday kan macam kaw kaw usually it's kaw kaw but this year macam it's so mellowed down
ya then like um malaysia punya lagi kaw dia orang punya black friday tapi I heard from my cousin dia orang punya black friday like no black friday
ya economy so bad already malaysia kasihan
same sudah lah murah
no not thai odyssey apa nama dia err no another one healthland
worth it sangat and then like kalau you pergi yang punya there are few outlets lah tapi the best one right you find the biggest outlet itu yang paling best
dia bukan spa it's totally all full thai massage
I pun tak ingat hundred and twenty minutes I sudah lama tak pergi nak dekat how many close to a year tak pergi
ya sedih ah
the pasar tani
ya no not normal pasar tau pasar tani
bukan pasar malam dia macam pasar pagi tapi tani lah like macam-macam lah you get like err avocado smoothie lah
then after that pineapple juice lah macam-macam ah I like
oh ah ah ya ya ya queue dia selalu panjang kan
then like kalau I masuk malaysia kan I selalu datang pagi like very very early then dia punya crowd tak sangat macam teruk sangat lah still manageable
kalau ya
ah ada lah
tak shops belum buka sebab I straightaway pergi pasar tani so I sudah sampai situ kan by the time I reach situ sudah six plus
then six plus tunggu kat pasar tani itu err I think about fifteen twenty minutes until dia punya set up semua sudah start then we go in ah
oh my favourite is avocado juice memang sedap
no um I also tak suka sayur tapi macam dia punya avocado juice is like the indonesian style dia macam campur gula melaka semua
ya it's nice dia manis yes
ya can memang sedap
yang dekat singapore punya you can try indonesian restaurants yang dekat I'm sure indonesian restaurant anywhere in singapore ada dia nama jus alpukat
ya tapi memang sedap if I have to choose a favourite drink that would be my favourite drink I really love avocado juice
tak ah I don't really like fruit fruit juice tapi like I don't know ah avocado is just an exception
malaysia yes I selalu pergi situ like staycation with my family over there tapi kalau staycation dekat singapore memang tak lah
ya and then might as well you duduk dekat rumah kan your own home
ya itu lah
yes is enough memang cukup uh sedih merana
I was like okay basically right I kalau tak pergi massage sudah berapa bulan kan my back will hurt so much
so I jenis macam how to say I'm very picky with my massage massage punya tempat tau I don't like indonesian style massage it's very painful
always yes tapi thai massage dekat singapore semua macam so expensive
ada eh
wah nak try ah
sebab indonesian punya uh style kan javanese style punya ya allah I bentan urat the urat the next day my whole body ache like mad kadang-kadang tak boleh bangun pun
yes it's very bad but ya but for thai massage kan I macam the next day more more active and boleh buat macam-macam
um I try both dua-dua I suka
I prefer the traditional one sebab dia dia push your body macam macam way then bunyi ketap-ketup wah
ya sedap

oh sedapnya
ya I also aduh then dia punya wanton pun sedap but I haven't tried I haven't tried puncak one
why sedap eh
ya sebelah sebelah jer kan ya but then you also should try the downstairs one the thai food memang sedap
chey macam promoting dia punya tom yum I tak pernah rasa tapi I pernah rasa dia punya green curry dengan dia punya err pineapple fried rice these those are my favourite
okay I remember the sebab dia ada dua kedai thai err one is called nana
and then nana you just walk straight turn left sebelah dia sudah it's literally beside it it is called something something thai food
this kita hari kecil saja
oh kalau you datang pukul sebelas atau pukul dua belas memang ramai orang tak ada tempat duduk
so I suggest ya weekdays I suggest you datang pukul sepuluh and below lah
I think not so crowded tapi pukul sebelas I can guarantee you banyak orang
ya ya and it's like cheap affordable and memang sedap
cartoon network I suka tengok err apa itu masa zaman I kecil-kecil lah I like to watch scooby doo
then err captain caveman and apa eh road runner
err ya I love these three last time right masa I kecil-kecil pukul err lima pagi I macam ada schedule tau at five right I will watch captain caveman then after that scooby doo and then after that in the day I will watch road runner
stop watching it right ya me also ya same tapi right my love for scooby doo right is still there somehow
dia macam how to say ah dia sudah macam cari hantu
you know like dia macam cerita budak-budak kan jadi dia punya hantu semua merepek-meraban tak tak macam hantu betul
so like and then like you will try to figure out who is the culprit and everything dia macam put thinking skills in you tau
so like you fikir siapa agaknya culprit ini oh bukan ini then after that turns out it's orang ini so like that kind of thinking skills so that so that's the type I like lah
ya it's all ya dia orang acah-acah macam hantu
it's very funny then like I suka sangat scoody doo sampai beli dia punya err apa itu plush toy
no lah dia anjing apa scooby doo anjing so okay lah I just have it like for fun because it's like memory my favourite cartoon I'll have one lah
yang piglet itu ke
yay you know like masa I dekat indonesia indonesia kan macam tak banyak cartoon kan
so like at like in the middle of the night I suka buka so like in the middle of the night dia orang boleh main shaun the sheep ya and then I watch till the next morning then my mum macam bangun like eh you haven't sleep no I watch shaun the sheep the whole night night ya then that is how I like shaun the sheep is very funny
dia kejap eh hmm I think it was in indonesian
ya dia macam voice over gitu
ya I also pelik
ya ah ya ya dia punya mouth memang tak in sync and it's not satisfying
ya ya ya betul betul
then right you always go malaysia right you pernah nampak cartoon ini nama larva tak
dia larva bukan volcano tahu dia larva is err macam ulat
dekat mana I tak tahu location dia tapi I tahu dia punya mall nama capital
ya tapi dia punya tingkat atas is just an indoor theme park for the kids then dekat bawah semua normal shopping mall
boring tapi larva itu memang funny
okay I don't like but my mum seems to like it which is so pelik ya very pelik my favourite is oggy and the cockroaches
oh ya I mean I also geli dengan cockroaches but after watching that show kan macam I pandang cockroach macam it's the oggy the cockroaches ya ya then I outgrew that fear of cockroach already so ya cause I find them funny
yes ya tapi tapi kan I have a phobia for spiders
I tak boleh spiders I will see if the spider is like one meter away I will scream I just cannot see spider
ya I just cannot phobia sangat because what happened was last time when I was kecil kan err I don't know whether is it dream or it actually happened but I was inside a car then after that the whole car dalam interior of the car is filled with spiders
ya ya I don't know whether is it a nightmare or real because that happened when I was a kid so after that terus I phobia
I tak boleh tengok spider
aiyo I can feel you alamak kalau I pun phobia
aduh aduh kalau I pun phobia seh
ya and then like what triggers it more is that my parents left me sebab dia orang nak pergi beli barang sekejap
ya then my parents found me crying macam orang gila
err but I really don't know whether it actually happen or is it a bad dream itu saja
my parents cakap they never leave me in the car before itu yang pelik
sampai I boleh phobia macam ini
ya until now that time err masa I kecil I pergi school camp pun sama
bukan ada spider we literally set our err khemah on a grass a grassland filled with macam spider tanah
ya spiders tapi dia orang on the tanah so like malam-malam I felt something on me I nampak spider I menjerit I literally went hysterical
ya then I ran I ran to the err guard posts semua then after that it took me berapa jam ah to calm down can you imagine you phobia then you nampak that thing on you
phobia ya ya on top of it you know then bila ya exactly then bila um I pekik itu kan can you imagine I pekik pukul dua pagi everyone bangun then everyone nampak yang dia punya tent is infested with spiders
so can you imagine the kecoh
I I tak kisah I campak semua barang I ada kipas dekat situ I campak kipas I campak lamp post anything over there I campak I just ran masuk toilet and I literally drenched myself with water
then after that I keluar I lari pergi dia punya teacher's post
they calm me down dia orang kasih apa dia orang kasih makan milo semua then after that err sudah reda dia orang cakap eh what happen to you boleh tanya lagi what happen to me aduh then after that I explain lah then dia orang cakap oh patut lah kau hysterical yang lain semua okay sudah dia orang sudah move tempat lain sudah I saja yang hysterical sebab mmhmm spiders ya
cause I find like big bang punya new music is like different tau now dia orang sudah disbanded kan jadi macam sedih ah
ya I listen to those two band sekarang kan banyak orang suka right
but sorry to say lah I tak suka dia orang
I I kalau cakap I tak suka kan kawan I semua kutuk I jadi I say ah ya I like their music
ya sudah tua bangka pun suka K pop
aduh dia orang have a pop up store dekat singapore tahu dekat plaza sing
I pun tak ambil
ya now I never listen to shinee shinee I used to call it shinee you know shinee shiny see sampai sekarang dia bawa bawa
shinee aduh so like last time masa I kecil kan I obsessed sangat dengan big bang um so my file every page of my file kind of the film kind
thin film I akan tulis quotes from big bang
ya bedsheet pun big bang bantal pun big bang
ya I memang crazy about big bang dulu
ya I think so dia punya story very pelik lah dia punya story it involves almost everyone that you didn't expect
ya macam gitu kan like uh I tak sangka I was really shocked
ya sedih duh I was like genuinely sad when I heard that he's out of big bang like wah I grew up with them tau
tapi if you follow him on instagram sekarang kan dia macam a bit siao ting tong ah
uh huh tak percaya you tengok instagram dia
macam siao ting tong serious
itu satu and um dia macam artsy fartsy actually I don't know whether he's like the sudah gila ke err dia memang buat-buat macam gila because dia punya post pun macam pelik-pelik
I don't know how to explain to you tapi post dia memang pelik semua
right pelik kan
macam sudah a bit off
err bedsheet pun ada
then tahun lepas I pergi err dia punya making of the studio
dia punya official set punya tempat
okay um depends lah kalau you fan memang lah it's your heaven there tapi kalau you tak suka harry potter then don't waste your money there
tapi dia punya set ya allah besarnya
dia it's so big then I think it took us like four hours to finish the whole thing
ya ya ya then sudah lah jauh daripada london so basically we empat jam over there and then after that one hour pergi one hour balik
tapi it's best kalau you nak pergi kan you ambil set lah so there is a bus hantar you bus ambil you
macam mana nak kira duh
I pernah pergi
okay okay I tak nak boast lah
most I haven't gone to err eastern europe yet macam prague itu semua belum pergi
no I I have never been to myanmar tapi I um my grandma is burmese
my grandpa sudah sudah pass away sudah
it's like um I decided not to learn burmese but memang susah
uh huh very mixed lah this family ya best lah I mean dia macam ya lah tapi like my my mum malay lah of course but my grandmother dia kahwin dengan melayu
ya my atuk is good looking not boasting tapi when I look at him memang wah any woman akan suka dengan dia at that time
then after that dapat my mum so malay lah I
ya melayu melayu lah melayu boleh
eh tak ada lah
okay ah oh but walaupun um ada sedikit campur err dia punya err darah kan tapi I hold very strongly to uh hang tuah
dengan P ramlee
dia rumah betul dia tapi they convert to museum
ya then um for hang tuah I memang suka history and everything macam gitu lah
so ya I pergi perigi hang tuah
ya perigi hang tuah
oh because dia macam dia bukan attraction to public tahu jadi macam orang-orang yang macam singaporean yang biasa yang tak suka history dia orang tak akan tahu tempat itu kalau dia orang tak buat research
so like macam I memang suka like zaman-zaman dulu punya history kan so I like dig out lah then after that I felt oh hang tuah ah I should go
um the I don't know if you know the puteri gunung ledang
puteri gunung ledang is also another story
oh baru add eh
ya who doesn't watch bujang lapuk
but ya lah fun lah but I ini suka discover about all this malay malay punya history kan so I literally baca pasal puteri gunung ledang and I'm already intrigued
err I pergi library satu thing satu pasal then the other one is internet lor
okay reading itu depends on um what book it is
ah ah kalau you give me roald roald dahl is it called roald dahl
I tak akan baca
best ke
oh that one notebook punya orang kan
ya ya they were just jealous jealous sikit aduh ya that's why ya yay I found find a friends fan okay so basically kan um I boleh bangun nowadays ah I boleh bangun pukul lima and then I'll be like okay I'm bored I'm going to watch friends really
ya oh my god same you feel me yay err then masa I pergi itu kan I happened to go to primark primark suka ada macam themed err themed christmas style so they will sell all the themed punya barang-barang lah so I pergi to this err one of the primarks lah then I saw a friends collection
pullover ya macam jacket tak ada zip
ya ya ya memang cosy gila
kalau I kan I tak nak branded you just give me primark and I will be happy for life
sebab they have themed
they have themed accessories itu one thing the other thing is that it's murah
um of course lah there is a different sikit lah tapi dia macam tak melampau macam other other kind of brands lah
and it's still worth it because you tak akan jumpa primark dekat singapore
sudah lama pakai pun masih okay
you pernah tengok yang um monkey tak
I suka tengok
ya ya ya that one mantis sembahyang solat mantis
uh apa eh aku pun sudah lupa
aku sudah cakap solat mantis tengok lah ketawakan orang

orang tak tahu apa gusi gusi is gum
I mean nervous pun macam gusi you don't know what is gusi
aduh and then there's one person cakap apa I don't have gusi
kelakar lah
I also don't like watch local youtube tapi because I like to um macam bab melayu-melayu ini I suka dengar orang macam tersasul ke apa kan so I suka tengok itu then laugh my lah lah you know

ya sudah tak ada sudah
I think the ya the last romance movie ah I tengok dekat cinema is apa eh crazy rich asians

then when I was primary six we went on a holiday then after that I kena accident
then in the accident like I was at bali then I was going back to singapore from malaysia then after that uh the car swerved cause like something hit my dad's car dari belakang tau then after that he swerved inside the longkang
then after that he went atas balik like he swerve the car back up lah but then when he got back the car on the road was like the other side you know like how it apa tu the car cars are going this way his car was already like this side and he stop then after that four of my siblings were out of the car like tercampak keluar then when I suddenly I was in this longkang like nasib I sedar diri if not they wouldn't like find me cause I was in a very deep longkang but then my legs were all in pain so I cannot like panjat the longkang ah cause I wasn't that steep but my legs was really really in pain then I shouted for help then this guy piggyback me up cause ambulance wasn't there at that point in time so I was put inside this car then my adik was also inside that car also aiman aiman
dia pun kat dalam kereta tu then after that bila ambulance datang I was like vomiting a lot lah because like the apa itu how to say ah traumatic

then after that they almost like took another person like cause my bed is here then another granny's bed is here so it's like tepi-tepi tau like side by side then after that she went like the person dah already angkat the grandmother
my dad wasn't there at that point of time and then my dad was like eh this one yang pergi singapore bukan itu so the the granny almost went to singapore then the the nenek was like very confuse lah
was like what mana aku nak pergi
my dad had to angkat gini
when aku sakit dorang like like a lot of people was around then he was stitching some stuff aku tengah sakit tau then after that they keep like talking loudly

then after that um my mum also not happy you know malaysia right they they ask you they insist that you go to apa itu that you stay in the malaysia then they ask you for money every single time they ask you for duit every single time
uh they ask for duit everytime then you know even my my adik want to wants to go back to singapore cause my mum already dah already going to inside ambulance you know the nurse have the audacity to say my mother that he cannot bring the baju that he was wearing cause that is hospital punya baju

ya cause that time we went during raya what
then after that she also satu hal ah I think she don't like me also then she
her mum pakai tudung I think she is religious
disappointed she she ah dia pun ada adik the adik I think now secondary school still
me uh um buka cerita this one I had
cute ah dia dulu
shut up diam ya every morning
then after that um then after that he confess his feelings that's like okay ah I I mean can just okay then we keluar together
and then after that like I'm when I was relationship with him right I didn't felt like myself like I even like cause that time I was ready like after after uh secondary school then I during secondary school cause I wasn't wearing hijab fully what
then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear hijab and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
haikal now with another girl that time kat paya paya lebar kita nampak dia pe
siapa no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
with izzat I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with afiq like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like nak tengok rambut pay more runway or something the whole time he that one
is the ya but it's very apa oh ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that one they don't care that kind of thing
then like dia kerja kat cafe
ya and dia kerja cafe sekarang actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even pandang orang bertudung
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say oh you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better lah like he don't straightforward say because he try to jaga my hati at first he don't know how to jaga hati perempuan then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like kenapa marah I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends cakap that there is banyak difference from him dulu and sekarang ya which is good lah then after that from that like eh this guy is different like really really different from my exes

kira nak tutup sikit lah but like like I don't like it when the dress is like above my lutut
uh I don't know I just nak try dulu sebab I feel like silver necklace macam tak kena sangat because
lagi lawa and fitting as a necklace then silver but like with other jewelry macam earring and rings
feel like silver lagi lawa
I hope like when school start next sem dia dah buka balik and like kita boleh balik sekolah because I cannot tahan anymore

as seen from my friends dia orang
I would go for motor lesen but like ada satu motor ni saya selalu nampak dia black it's like black
it's Yamaha but I still don't know what model it is tapi it's so pretty
tak boleh ya
then like you spend money on it tapi tak pakai
oh ya yang electric punya
then owning kereta sendiri
habis nak spend lagi
wow wow dah kaya
I told you I already bilang you that I'm not good at it what
I just don't like it sebab nanti kadang dia rasa melekit tu
sebab macam campur dengan peluh ugh cause I always put it like in that in between joints
tak suka sangat ah
I actually don't mind it sia sebab it stop me from garuk
can don't pemalas or not
tapi kalau dah ada why would I buy mah
err rarely sebab sekarang tengah pakai mask so like I don't see the sun why would I wear
right see it's a two way thing not bukan I saja pe
I think is their like new collection ke apa
I have never ada interest in wallets I feel like asalkan it can hold my cards and my money
um baik ah kau
kau eh
kan ah itu susah
ada pekik kan a'ah
um kat sekolah selalu kena check in check out temperature taking semua
tak suka ah
nak minum air pun susah kena keluarkan mask semua
macam lek bro lek bro cuma nak minum air
a'ah kena kena nak kena sepak muka
oh oh did I tell you about kat sekolah kat sekolah kan got this girl dia macam irritating gila babi tak tahu
a'ah dia macam bites off macam gitu you know
dia macam tengok aku macam stare stare macam gitu
tak ada tapi like I I cakap dengan dia like tapi her vibes macam really off lah like dia macam suspicious dia macam cakap dengan aku like one way then she will go out and then she will talk to someone else another way
okay tapi kan like
I felt very petty lah tapi like um what's another like do you have any like macam petty reason
you like don't like somebody even though like macam
just met ke atau
macam Tinder ke muslim match ke
but it makes sense because macam like if you going to get to know that person
and then they they are like the way their vibes macam tak link dengan kau so it's very weird of course of course you would say no
kau gen Z
ya semua semua online
like orang can find like what they need to know about you through online social media semua tu
if you going to use normal you going to use a different name itu kan catfish
okay kau betul kau betul
kalau age lain sikit macam um please remove remove ah kan I mean as long as you're over twenty one so it's
macam mana okay ya paedophiles out of the way
technically it's a podcast cerita malam punya podcast kan
ya I guess that's like a pet peeve kan macam orang like lie about their age basically they fake their personality
ini what pet story ke apa buat pet story
huh makan um
makan Maggi bro a'ah
ya ya lah I lead the simple life senang sangat pe
aku makan mee gorengnya tak it's the
tak it's the Myojo one Myojo brand um ya
oh did you hear ada restaurant baru kat bawah karma
tak tau ah
oh alamak alamak kesian
macam perangai perangai dah change ah macam gitu
alamak so sweet nya
alah macam gitu pun boleh alah
kenapa monyet monkey lah
dia kepoh ah jer
I know lah tapi macam third party terdengar
that's mean tak baik sia
alright makes sense it's okay you want clarification just as in secondary school sekolah menengah
who are like there to like support you kan so macam like if you if you find like friends who are girls then macam they just want to like
befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that tu salah macam salah sikit
but I think like like the karma that's going to be served to me but kalau
tapi kan if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
dia cakap dengan aku like uh the way I
break up with people macam traumatising sikit
dia cakap macam sikit jer lah tapi
like revenge lucky revenge kan macam
oh okay for siapa
I will give karma back to him sia like macam
oh macam like he will say oh girls like perempuan tak boleh buat ni pe kena ada lelaki semua
ah ah ah ya ya ya macam gitu macam gitu tapi kan like I'm I feel macam
macam like you got nothing to prove
aku rasa because right I realise
if macam like
like some guys kan macam them they try to over like try to be overconfident
no because kan like kalau dorang macam like they get into a relationship with you then dia rasa macam okay
subconsciously dorang macam project their insecurities on to you
um does it's like whatever they are lacking then dorang macam insecure gila babi then they like ah macam mana I cannot
um tapi like confidence is good like in a person tapi macam tapi kan if you're like too overconfident then you are just macam hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because macam I macam I don't like the fact that macam some guys ada
because dorang macam live so macam insecure because of like maybe what somebody else cakap dengan them or like something that somebody criticise them or whatever and then suddenly they are like insecure for their entire life and then they like project it on to you and then now suddenly using that and then fuelling that anger and then they are like I'm angry at you because somebody said that I'm not tall enough something like that kan a'ah
I I I I will agree lah women are the same but I feel like macam like perempuan semua we are so like in tune with our own emotions then especially we will like in like a group of girls and then we're like very comfortable with each other which kita boleh blush out berbual banyak-banyak we can talk like this end to the other end like how we're doing in this conversation
macam podcast sia tak tau
I'm edgy I'm cool I'm so quiet oh my god macam sounds like me
um okay alah kesiannya oh no
even if you are just friends ke atau macam mata air semua you don't own anybody
macam overly clingy
to get kan duit susah
I just macam
kat padang padang killer yes oh it's farm
macam cartoon cartoon semua
specifically animation or animasi
ah tengah manifest
tengah manifesting sekarang tak boleh I'm trying to get it still
oh aku rasa
aku rasa they will macam
oh oh oh oh okay K K okay for my cat right for my cat gizmo kan he's a big cat dia kucing besar dia macam chonky so I think dia the personality macam macam chill laid-back macam nak lepak jer macam hmm a'ah macam lepak jer nak
nak makan tidur makan tidur macam senang ah
ya ah a'ah macam gitu macam gitu macam gitu macam abang bulat abang bulat nak cakap macam chill talks kat midnight ke
um probably macam I'll talk about my
two elders so gizmo's one of them and then like precious is the other one ya I feel like she will be low key macam
hidung tinggi a bit sombong sikit because she's very pretty she's very pretty
ya but tapi right I think she will be the macam queen bee very pretty tapi dia very macam
oh banyak sia
I got four other cats eh macam mana
alright okay then my other cats dulu dia nakal dia nakal banyak so like she's she's like those smallest
dia macam cili padi a'ah ya she's a cili padi I love her
small feisty she likes to bite people oh I love her but dia punya gigit macam main-main ah
ah T one hundred kan dia macam shy
like she got she got ya ya ya ya she got high she got high energy ah so sometimes dia macam like lari lari lari lari from left to right
ya ya dia lompat dia lompat like on the rack semua on the wall pun dia macam spiderman
but I think kan she'll be like macam
the sweet one tapi dia got probably dia ada social anxiety
cause dia takut orang
ya tapi sorang dia macam hyper gila dia macam takut a bit shy malu-malu ya then like got another one um her name is peppy
I found her kat bawah blok dia tinggal kat rumah tapi kan we found her macam wondering macam like a lost puppy
you know what I mean ya so ah tapi kan she sombong sikit dia macam precious
ya ya ya tapi kan dia tak suka aku I don't know my sister yang jumpa tapi
so macam sakit hati ya kan tapi like sekarang dia dengan dia like he he's like my mum's baby ah
she followed somebody into the clinic so I macam I just take her home lah bawa balik
like that ah I I brought her I bought a carrier just to bring her home can you imagine the love I have for this cat anyway dia for
for baby I think she's macam high energy dia macam lulu sikit
macam nakal macam cili padi pun she also small
macam she just she just want love and attention
so macam like ah I'll be at home like I baru bangun semua and then she and then she macam like she rub against me macam nak sayang I know I know yes
no you know like banyak orang like like to tell me like liza you better find somebody or else you going to end up like that forty five year old with like ten cats
you're right kau betul
like like no no no like last time last time they'll be like cat kat bawah blok
ya it's like you are so nice to them right macam like you go
go downstairs you kasi makanan then they will like trust you then that's how you build a relationship
nine nine nine abang polis
sorry ah dogs are a bit macam susah
you need to train them macam really train them because macam kalau for cats kan like they can be a certain way kat rumah
but but sometimes macam you go to the vet clinic then they macam ganas ke they like to scratch around is normal lah because they're not comfortable mah tapi kalau dia kat rumah they're very comfortable they're very loving macam is so easy for them to like
they're not like dogs dogs kan you need to macam train them properly like okay here is where sit or like here is where you poop pee whatever
a'ah the only time dorang macam very noisy is macam they belum sunat ah
a'ah belum sunat
ya ya ya when they belum sunat they macam like itchy then they cari cari mata air they cari lover so macam of course lah they very
but dogs dogs sometimes they just bark for no reason like kalau like if you have jin in your house like they would just bark
oh got one time when I was younger lah dulu-dulu macam primary school there was a
and then it broke through like one of their glass panels so it's ya it was like a there was like a macam
it's so tiny though I don't know it just like okay first macam it was already at the door then I was like okay
tapi got panel so I'm like whatever I'm just going to wait for my lift then
then suddenly all I hear is the dog barking and then suddenly he's at my ankles so I was like what do I do macam mana ni
cili padi ah
macam macam short people
but like of course these people who already got their doctorates from like nineteen fifty two dorang macam aiya I did it before you can confirm do one
ya but but right okay um so singapore always says like hi it's a very difficult time so like if you need if you need um help please go find it and then they like give you macam like all this like hotlines to call if you're having like anxiety having depression blah blah blah
that's why otherwise macam
bro tak boleh lek lek pe
kan macam like stop demonising tattoos or like macam or like piercings
macam it's very bland it's like macam you you masak ayam masak merah but there's no merah
ya so so can we can we bring it back um I mean it's not it's been taken out but can we bring it into the society where we can normalise ayam masak merah with the merah
you close your eyes tutup mata sudah
err just now the chinese lesson err was err was uh I was feeling very very tired uh sebab uh penat cause tadi pagi uh saya pergi ke sungei buloh nature reserves

err semalam uh I spend like almost for the whole day at err I was studying for my studying for my exam for my finance exam so most of the time err kat kat lah belajar jer sampai from pukul satu sampai pukul enam gitu
ya I just study makan uh belajar makan belajar makan belajar makan ya uh
err uh actually I bought food from bukit batok bukit batok I didn't buy anything from cause macam nak macam nak save duit eh nak save duit kan so err I bought from a like a bukit batok store a store from bukit batok yang jual yang kat bawah that kind
ya so the food there macam nasi lemak nasi ayam is like uh macam murah-murah kat sana it's like dua setengah like one satu satu satu setengah gitu so macam very murah then harga dia harga dia murah so err kalau tak sedap tak apa lah ya so that's what I had for my lunch yesterday
mm kat mana it's like bukit the bukit batok one
dekat kan
apa err is it nice
err maybe macam dah lama tak makan burger king
I went out for dinner with someone so kita err we went to try out this cafe at jurong east um the new cafe ah so yesterday dia punya uh it was its opening day um I forget what is the cafe called lah ya but it's near err area that that that jurong east area ya so uh when the food macam uh it's boleh tahan lah macam
um not the best not the best decent decent food ah so I tried err fish and chips err I tried fish and chips and err order also mushroom soup ah so the fish and chips macam apa tu uh boleh tahan lah macam lebih baik kalau it's apa tu lebih garing eh lebih garing ah and dia punya apa tu dia punya dia punya flavour eh
err is not my taste lah not my taste ya then their their mushroom soup is fine err macam terlalu salty for me ya
no the taste macam masin ah masin salty ah so I had err this tea called strawberry mango tea which is err interesting it taste it's just not bad lah it smells not bad the tea is like any other tea but the smell is good
err just to try out new stuff lor like he's a foodie so macam uh just go go around try new halal food see if it's nice in singapore there is not much halal options right so you just want to see see macam just take a look see see eat eat a bit here and there
we shared the food because err the err he he ate in the morning like before he came out so macam he's trying to I think he's trying to like do a bit of weight loss also lah cause he quite big size ya
twenty four hours so there's also a drive through kan ya so we we just it's a drive through ya so we just uh we went there for awhile just to macam have a bit of dessert lah macam so we we ordered like err two mocha iced mocha latte
ya I suka
ya so it was it was not bad lah macam it's uh is a bit uh ex apa tu a bit mahal and a bit uh sweet ya sweet tapi just sit down there macam just to berbual-bual jer lah berbual-bual talk about stuff
kat mana like how much
oh I think it's the mi Maggi one right mi Maggi noodles
tak nampak benda-benda halus eh
a'ah seh now now like uh sekarang tengah hujan right uh it's hujan semenjak pukul lima empat setengah gitu ah kan ya tapi macam dah it has it looks like the rain has subsided a bit so I think there might be a chance that we can play badminton at six
actually the weather now is like the best cause like macam it's mendung it's cooling
ya mendung err a bit sejuk and it's just nice weather ah
ya it will be hard to play badminton when it's too windy lah ya and if it's too slippery because right now the tennis court is a bit err it's like it looks very wet basah cause of the hujan
which is what you want teleport
so the is like a sci-fi movie where err the story is about this err boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so err it happened err sebab one day dia macam apa tu he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so dia punya classmates I mean when the group macam ada
gangster gangster sikit ah ya so like even though they are very young the err they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time uh macam dia tengah lari tengah lari from the orang kan abeh um one of them from the bad guy actually tembak
tembak the the guy so he hit the side of his head ah ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone err in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid lah but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
err to actually um see whatever you're typing err whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related lah and he has the ability to macam technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like err if you think about it right macam there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool lah very cool
ya cuma macam now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others uh for others for his own good and to help others lah I mean macam so he helped to track down the the culprits ah so the story was err macam apa tu uh this uh the neighbourhood is macam ada apa eh
macam ada is run by this err drug drug society drug a group ah like err ya so he helped to track this group down abeh macam help the police to do so he he use his technology macam to draw them in lah to expose on the drugs and dark secrets dorang ada to the neighbourhood and to the police
orh no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts macam like err ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like err put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool lah ya
ya ke oh is it that's nice oh he more like he targets the the gangsters society but dia macam he let them uh like he drains all of their bank accounts so that dorang tak ada resources
orh err usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience err any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that macam
there's always like err well known stereotypes err within the malay community err for example macam one very good example would be macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai in math gitu ya from young so and usually like err because like orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat void deck gitu so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people lor in a sense ya
which I think err palsu lah because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it what it's the same for everyone cuma dulu is okay what to lepak cause like last time with your friends just chill chill lah like if if you like to me if your if your kind of lepak is main err like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of lepak is really like is at the void deck lah chit chat yang main guitar ya so is the same kind of lepak lah I mean is just different kind of how you view lepak as
even though I do agree that err there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but err to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to err macam public uni ah I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases macam after poly right they they err they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then macam if you look at err maritime studies kan err from poly err I think I got one friend yang macam he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship one
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose lah I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya macam gitu jer lah
lama eh it's very long
macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam eh
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools tapi when you talk about those non like err like we have certain schools in singapore yang macam the fees very expensive kan so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not err for those families yang macam tak boleh afford lah because the fees are very expensive even like um macam if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ah education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families yang macam or those like err families yang macam rumah tangga ada masalah uh mak bapa tak boleh beri uh tak boleh kasi apa tu uh apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada uh apa tu anak-anak mereka so I think this is where it will be nice lah if the err those families uh those kids um can
you do lah but some people just need err err a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like uh macam some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit uh of like resources a bit then they will start to see orh this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school lah so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards uh macam striving to to get a scholarship
but you have to eat other people for meals dahsyat seh
you go kerja is it
ni hari today I wake up then I never do anything sia like I wake up right I wake up quite early but I got no school today so like I don't know what I
why is that perangai lembu isn't that like perangai
ya and then after that like wait wait then like you beli yang MacBook kau why is it rose gold
isn't it rose gold pink then after that yang gold apa benda
you buy yang mana yang MacBook air

ya is yeah yeah so cause dia dia nak macam like
um integrated society or whatever so they so they like abolished they abolished the madrasah the madrasah punya system so there's no more like exam or anything cause we actually had a Chinese girl in our class
and then like she kesian sia all the textbooks all in Malay abeh dia tak faham like she was just like so confused and the only thing she could can understand ya the only thing she can understand is the Arab cause like
apa kau okay maybe cause like he learn cause like what then
like banyak melayu kan but then I don't know lah
you know that time we go to his house for raya right then his nenek ask #Kahir#</P2 siapa tu then after that he just shake shake he just like huh he just like shake his um
err I don't know lah but I just anyhow just give her response then she just oh okay then I'm just like how you speak to your grandmother like that then then after that he say oh ah usually when I go to my grandma's house right she will give me food then I'm just like um sedap sedap sedap
I don't know I don't even know if he knows lawa

eh should I mandi
motor kuat bro
my father hantar me to school naik motor since like primary school

oh okay um sekarang I'm doing like part time um kerja part time so macam um I do some um actually doing financial advisory um ya at the same time doing um freelance freelance works ah ya um macam and doing translation works for untuk bahasa melayu to and bahasa indonesia ya
ah no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had um indonesian punya maid so sometimes ya
uh ya ya ya so actually um like last time my maid selalu um talk to me in in bahasa indonesia macam I know how ya how to speak ya hmm
um actually it just baru baru start so macam um macam just had like briefing then uh so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
ya I think macam health actually quite important lah um ya I rasa macam when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy macam what's the what's the point what's the point kalau kau pergi kerja everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy lah for your good for your health and stuff like that
same lah sama sama ya is is I think macam it's quite common gitu to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun in
you kerja oh so baru graduate also
oh drama side drama side macam buat apa like day to day like what is it like
oh macam just macam entertainment untuk dia punya budak-budak that kind of thing lah
hmm so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company macam allows you to to to to take breaks in between lah
mm dia mm okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common lah untuk like some some of us yang baru start kerja then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that macam when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like macam is it a mismatch of expectations bila you baru start kerja you thought it would be something else
mm actually good good that your boss macam I recognize that you you need to take a break then um then kalau when you're better than you can always balik go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me uh ya lah macam I work for dua tahun then lepas tu uh I tried dua company tapi macam uh at the same time it felt different tapi macam same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also macam tak tahu if it's the industry punya issue or kalau I need to change industry atau change company ya macam that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to macam take a break and then um from there I explored different different punya industry and then um at the same time I kerja part time then um macam trying to at the same time I explore lah whether I feel nak stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough lah one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right macam you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya at least some more now macam it's COVID punya period then then nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
it's something better than macam nothing right
ya ya ya I think to be honest macam singaporean man a bit cautious or like became fikir banyak sangat of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then kalau doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so macam just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new sekarang I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so macam at every ya every setiap pagi I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for macam tiga jam jer then um ada assignment then um some project ya just learning new things I guess
oh the the webinar is actually uh era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's enam enam bulan then ya at the same time they are macam giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya tapi those hmm tu actually untuk mid career adults lah macam those that ada work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new lah I guess ya
tak payah because everyday macam is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
but how macam mana nak teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
hmm okay I see I see I see sebab dia what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
ya macam overload of things to to do right do you feel
tapi what about the your your other work punya colleagues like do they feel the same way
hmm sounds very challenging lah macam susah so
ya so macam I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment lah so I started taking um um I started joining this financial advisory punya company then dia orang give like trainings um to to prepare us lah macam how to how to like you know prospect for clients macam how to um basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I rasa sales punya skill is quite important macam in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or kalau be it ideas or products to anybody lah so so I rasa macam it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn macam susah to macam convince people um to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process lah I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
hmm I macam baru start meeting clients that um uh there are some um potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that ah ya
so um other than that macam I think you what you said about um an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive um like make you macam want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess tapi macam I haven't actually um had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then um for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to macam earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense macam or even though sekarang I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy macam ya like I don't bangun tak rasa macam stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work macam you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this macam how I felt lah everyday after after work last time like you balik rumah macam tak ada mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
ya I think it's common like macam I spoke to my kawan my friends dia orang pun macam rasa the same the same thing lah ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
then you got try macam try company company lain tak like because ini your first job kan
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether macam is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
is it you are supporting financially ke or dia boleh pay for dia punya own things like oh is it difficult
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay um so um ya it's really macam it's I think sekarang we're in a very difficult punya position pasal there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
oh you are twenty only oh sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my mak and my my dad don't pressure me lah like because ya even though I'm already twenty five tapi dia orang macam they know it's not easy lah our time to like they said last last time by twenty five dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak you know that kind of thing but they but they don't macam push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think ah macam syukur lah like I feel quite
mm I see ya I think macam same my family macam not very affectionate also when growing up what macam don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
you ada connections with like theatre punya um like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
um actually macam I just told him I am exploring something new lah while because like at the same time also um learning like macam tengah belajar new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so macam I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything lah like I can pay for my own things like I ada savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that lah like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like ada ada like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
ya I think macam having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace lah it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing macam it you make you look forward to nak pergi kerja you look forward to seeing them
then dia orang dia orang tak bayar hmm
hmm oh you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like macam mana like how does it work
so what do you think macam you want to try ke you don't want ke
at the same time um I rasa like while we're still young important to save also lah saving is quite important ya ya so macam since since I was young kan I always believe in saving then macam I am quite thrifty lah macam and like macam tak spendthrift sangat so like I made sure to to have enough savings lah so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
tapi you got you got try macam apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood tak
oh but now is the intake right you said october you just check macam apply for fun lah like what's what's it there's nothing to lose kalau you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right hmm
ya tapi you can just tell her later kan like macam that you you're but you're officially left right you said
tapi ada notice period tu semua lah
oh kenapa
then kalau kalau you leave you must bayar dia punya six thousand ke tak like it like if you do finally decide
tapi macam you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then kalau tak then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
okay actually I ada kawan yang just started the early childhood she also was from engineering punya field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so kalau you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about dia punya program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so dia totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people macam sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not macam out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya macam some ya ya ya that feeling what's segan to us just sometimes that feel that way tapi actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience macam whatever you have experience lah then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least macam lah like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry lah then at least you roll one out
so actually I met her from um like a random punya part time job also then macam we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and macam after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya macam random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
I don't know I think macam I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of macam thought into it it's not macam a fleeting decision like I was really macam very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my punya bosses all like understand lah like my work was difficult lah like I was facing a difficult punya client macam everyday hentam on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
at the same time macam as in like I said lah because I had macam savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important lah like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing lah ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine kalau you ada children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing lah like take a break and not work kind of thing
oh probation ah macam sekarang sekarang is probation period is it
tapi dia punya contract what the contract say
no but your contract said you have so actually macam you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then dia orang tak they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
you have do you have siblings like you ada kakak or adik like
oh only one kakak lah
huh sorry oh see I see okay ya I'm also not tak tak not close to my siblings my elder siblings too pasal dia orang dah marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common lah
so um I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like macam sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that hmm that is so important macam not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
tapi macam like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to macam cafe where dia punya server is so friendly like dia bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending dia punya food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too

hey sorry I know I came I'm supposed to come like an hour earlier but I came timing gini
yeah tapi like luckily I got like direct bus ah I mean it's a long bus ride but it was a nice long bus rides
yeah macam
like forty minutes then like I was thinking to myself like shall I take a train or what then macam like
suprisingly ada eh cause macam like apa
newton or something then I have to keep like tukar tukar actually no like last year I at dhoby right and like my line is the green line then I have to keep like switching and stuff
yeah I feel like I mean like I understand that we have to wear the mask and stuff tapi like
macam so leceh you know like I'm still so
yeah I was supposed to go for like two concerts this year you know I was supposed to go for yungblud and rex orange county tapi like COVID
mm begitu lah nak buat apa kan
apparently like supposedly my ah first ah music festival lah kirakan so macam like excited kan
habis COVID habis like pun tak boleh masuk I really miss you know I want to go like
you know makan sate malam malam
murah and it's like so nice to
then like she sell err she her husband sold those like bakso cuts you know
and because of COVID cafe dah tutup seh then macam like we feel very bad because it's like
she's kind of like she lives in a kampung right then she just like gave birth and then like
tak ada duit like the only source of income was like
from her husband then macam like baby tak ada duit then the other time
we called her during raya the baby tengah demam seh
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like kita like very rapat dengan dia
bila raya right like dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri you know like I mean
if they live in you have to stay in then after that like you like for raya you cannot balik kampung which is like
their bandar is right so like their family members are all back in like kampungs and stuff
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because uh during like hari raya like that time
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like pocong just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers lah you know macam they dress up macam pocong gitu habis just to like
scare cause like malam malam kan dekat
dekat hutan semua tu so macam like it scared them and then like
patah balik sia I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
I think they did tried to do the same kat indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west gitu
it's all pakai laptop eh
like you pakai laptop then like it's just what like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like kenapa tak buat
you know like kenapa tak buat
err tak tak tak tolong mak or something like that you know so I'm just like
I told you kan like the day before I pergi err the malayan council
then err you know portion dia orang kan besar kan so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like mahal kan
then uh he's like okay so I just met him and then like kita lepak
sekejap I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to panjat you know cause like
also then after that like at night I went to like jumpa kawan you know just to lepak also
I don't know there's this thing called the the rendang daging salai or something
it taste like you know the kuah is sort of like rendang then with linguine with like scallops
sotong and then there's like daging salai on top lah which is like I don't know
really sedap lah it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out tapi for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about rendang being the nicest but
tak sedap you know everything is sedap
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause macam like tak ramai orang
so macam especially with the whole COVID thing I pun like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's sedap you know and then like
pre pre COVID lah they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels gitu
I mean it is arab street lah everything there is like mahal and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
ayam madura which is like oh yeah
ayam geprek you know something like that like very indonesian based
but it's just a bit leceh cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
I don't know I use you know like kat Telegram they have those macam groups kan then macam
you know they mention things like for example like oh they never mentioned the pay like berapa or just like
oh you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then macam like
benda gini all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there what
habis dia orang tak ni so I was just like
yeah and then it's like macam cause like sometimes like
at least tak payah you know terfikir fikir you know kalau dapat ke tak
don't tell you the full truth then macam like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
akan lama gini you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay lah macam
but I thought like okay lah like lama lama pun maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most apa apa boleh makan kat luar jer tapi still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
so that stupid idiot of a president cakap kan like
like the president cakap lah and then the next day
really ada orang ni seh like actually drank bleach and stuff
mm tapi macam like a bit
that this like donald trump like macam dia punya priorities is just not
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already tengah COVID
so I feel so macam kasihan for them lah that they have such a bad president like this
common at all you know like so kasihan huh
hey that's not bad I mean like no offence lah but for an average melayu you know it's
okay lah like you know you cannot expect much from orang melayu lah honestly sorry but yeah
you know reciprocate also it's a bit like sakit hati
kau tahu macam boring seh like
cakap lah benda interesting you know I received a joke once like
cinta like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate dulu ah
habis like macam for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
from the second you match ada like
dua puluh empat jam for you to uh respond then like
no I think it's macam like concept baru because macam like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
like wipey mat melayu sort of things like you'll actually find like
so macam
err there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff tapi now I don't know lah I mean like cause
cause like Din Tai Fung sana kan halal right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always naik like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year tak dapat pergi it feels so weird you know cause like
normally when I go to I get very like jelak because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
tapi like
this year tak dapat pergi it's just like I want to go back
I thought halal tapi tak halal then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not halal in singapore
but I was from a wedding tu I like
I came in like my kebaya so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
me and my cousins all nak cabut because like
cousins so it's like rapat but
not very rapat
going for like jemputans and stuff like that pasal macam like when growing up gitu
macam I don't know I'm like very rimas cause macam panas kan then you have to like dress up semua and then like
pergi ah wedding tapi tak kenal siapa you know then macam I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore tapi I do enjoy if it's like
then you talking about the biryani like I think it's always a star of the show right then um
satu kali that time uh my my aunt I think
just I just decided to go lah because like macam I was I I know her what
then she kahwin
the biryani was just like next level
so like tak payah makan for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like kasi kita bawa balik then like got the ayam masak merah then the nasi minyak and all that
okay okay nasi biryani would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like nasi minyak
then like rendang and ayam masak merah that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
like from ah um you know ikan tiga rasa like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be biryani and stuff like that's so weird
who like got married like during like the second week of raya and I feel like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very pantang you know cause I feel like I'm from a
then like to have a wedding macam like no offence ah tapi macam like spoil seh
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just kahwin like or something you know
I mean like why why do people do it buat penat jer cause like normally like
people are just more tired during ramadhan you know and then like
kejar maghrib and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's terawih and stuff like that I think this
ah tapi I
ah I think recently they uh naikkan to maybe I think fifty
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then macam bigger honeymoon lah kirakan tapi macam
I'm also like the first child right so macam I feel like I understand my parents point macam dia nak you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know kalau tak
invite satu like if I invite like sikit sikit tu I don't want like dia orang sakit hati ke apa
tengok lah macam mana if anything also just like kahwin sikit sikit then like you know like
you know so macam like a lot of like the kampung kampung roots are still in within my family
so macam like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know macam gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
silat thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I pengantin apa like it's like I will be pengantin once in my life only what so macam like
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like panas cause like
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like budak kecil all can like run around
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super geli and it's so merepek cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
you know macam like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
I thought about it like australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like dah banyak
singaporeans there's banyak asians then like you know the whole like kiasu thing going on
so I think to myself just like you know okay lah then mat salleh at least I know I got chance to be the top right tapi like
dengan asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
nak migrate like like you said lah with the whole like tradition
uh like you know it's like very like new like you dah biasa with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
like I've also been called like celup lah like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you dengan your melayu
gitu but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
no lah I feel like it's also important cause macam like it's just like your self identity juga apa then like
I feel like at least in singapore also macam like the malay community is like
rapidly macam the language is dying you know I feel like
personally because macam like okay lah like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in bahasa err in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
it's just different lah macam like melayu sini the standard macam lower you know then macam a lot of people like just
dah tak tahu pakai like they don't really speak
then also macam like some of them like don't even know how to cakap you know
so yeah lah then like macam a lot of like little like ah traditional things are like dying too
like macam like anyam ketupat you know macam like
my family ah bila raya we still make it a thing lah macam every year we still do it you know and it's like
sedih ah because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable err like memory ah you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of raya and I feel like for me
holidays just like I mean like hari raya and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know buat kuih raya and like ayam ketupat and like just like getting already getting the house like raya ready
macam best ah like you know but like
then ya then anisa pun
I come late also lah cause dia kata dia nak datang pukul tujuh eh tak tak tak dia di
rumah pukul tujuh setengah then sampai pukul
lapan setengah begitu then the end she said because err
a'ah memang jauh
dia tinggal lagi jauh dari niza
why she comes to why she is coming to school cause she got itu
hari ini dia ada photoshoot
who is the vice head menarik ah
eh dia orang nak start recruiting untuk itu
ya but is it some ad hoc tak ada heats

that's quite funny though like once terus dah
sad I think next next sem kita set out account ah
macam kan I don't know how it works but maybe ada profile serious how is it
one hour one hour terus dah dapat
I tak perlu upload gambar sendiri
then what if like the person dah kahwin then lepas tu ada masih orang nak try hit on the person
menarik oh god
oh it's like didn't see lah cause like your apa tak nampak apa-apa pun kan
eh then you know the Instagram what's that filter where they have their halal meter or haram meter thingy
oh cause like someone told me one of these dating apps they have this halal haram ratio or something
we have been wanting to do it just for the loves ke
to go but then I always feel bad because you like you say orang kat Muzmatch macam dia orang serious
ya it does oh ya about apa yang you said
how do you feel about that isn't that like a dating app but then macam physical
kan kan tak macam kalau dekat
kalau physical physically macam desperate tapi kalau dalam dating app tak desperate ke
apa-apa lah nak buat apa-apa apa lah apa korang lah
oh so much sia on topic ini
paint tengah picnic oh my god that is so cute
ya oh my god then like the apa
but then macam kalau the date doesn't go well I will be like bye I don't really want to share this sunset with you
oh then I will stand up lah try my best to stand up to him then like if macam
dia tak kisah pun like he is so obnoxious and so full of himself then I won't even bother lah I will just walk away
wait apa tu catfish
nineteen and this boy sudah gatal
I think I do cerita pasal dating apps or dating
wait cerita netflix oh
dating dating semua
oh kan apa ada some cerita-cerita cinta pasal
where the parents just like apa pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something
macam dia orang beli under the fiancee skim thing cepat kan then when I see it I was like ah
nah ah just say they macam I wouldn't want I know that through all these apa
bodoh apa-apa apa-apa sebab oh multiculturalism at its best
then I saw one uh caption uh bukan caption ah macam post
dia cakap pasal the politics then I think it was about this
uh like it's so sad macam because of all this kind of things it's just some disagreements
uh kadang dia orang tak sedar diri tau
macam sedih lah macam what can you do also
tak kadang dia orang akan suddenly berbual pasal the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff
mm kenapa orang chinese tak percaya ah macam
ya kan orang-orang chinese tak faham lah
then lepas tu dia orang kata apa
hidup dalam susah hati ini dalam negara ini
ya that's the thing like everybody keep telling me like apa macam eh kita orang sepatutnya macam bersyukur lah sebab
kita orang tinggal dekat singapore singapore bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat ya ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims
entah lah
kelakar eh tadi berbual pasal dating abeh tak pasal-pasal berbual pasal politics pula
it's just so campur up
ah tak nak
I always stop dekat second around
macam banyaknya rajin budak ni kuasanya rebutan
oh then kita orang sama lah tak tahu lah kalau this time dia orang akan
um accept ke tak we shall see
a'ah that's why like I thought we hari ini nak keluar
nak nak meet up with my friends then
furama kat mana
tengok lah
ha siapa seh manusia
zebra zebra kecil
tak tahu I don't don't really understand your range no
a'ah dia suka tidur
tu dia purr
I want to go to safari yang dekat africa
atau dekat sri lanka pun ada ada
uh sangkar
uh sangkar sangkar
eh terima kasih lah
bukan safari safari betul
dia makan untuk apa jia jia tu lah
maybe he ya don't kind of pregnant begitu he buat to rasa something like that
best nya hidup dia orang
ya but now but my apa algorithm is more of ya human babies and cats
ya no but actually banyak seh macam
tak tak hendak tak apa lah just get over eat I just get over eat
other house on TikTok and stuff and they've been doing macam ni
mm mungkin dia orang pun macam nak
ah tapi ada satu macam
macam quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
entah macam ada beberapa challenge
oh tak there is one challenge that I like
is was like um calling my um my girlfriend or wife a third name lah I think that's quite cute actually I like that one but some other challenge macam questionable
tak tak she doesn't follow me anymore yeah tak nak kecoh sia
and then his pelamin is so pretty I love it
kat luar some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I kaypoh kaypoh tanya dia kat mana
takde any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then orang akan marah and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the pelamin ah you'll see the bride
dengan dress dia lagi
oh my god I was thinking of that tetapi kan tetapi eh tapi kan macam singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
that macam abeh tengok sunset kalau sunset dia lawa oof lagi best then kita boleh tengok sunset sama-sama
like the whole family tengok sama-sama
then macam at the same time I'm scared like hujan tempias even if there's like shelter ya and confirm mahal seh ya would you want to spend so much
like I want a small majlis jer
tapi nanti orang sedih nanti macam baiklah
like I really hope if I end up getting married macam the
okay baiklah itu sahaja yang kita ada untuk hari ini sesi perbualan
dan hazimah
tu lah eh bila eh kita last jumpa each other
oh that time kita
oh apa ni yang
oh ya ya ya ya okay okay okay but that's not counted as jumpa lah because it was on google meet
and I think just because of this recording baru lah kita nak jumpa
kalau tak aku rasa next year baru aku jumpa kau
macam for me leceh seh you know like
for me lah for me like kau nak
like kau nak kena work from home then kau kena go back office might as well just work from home kan because your job pun doesn't really require you to like
you know it's like very easy what you just err turn on your laptop and then duduk depan screen jer
but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually lah my daily my daily apa err daily timetable will be like lapan setengah eight thirty then
kalau at most pun I will end about what five six kau imagine kau duduk in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya because for me kan aku macam
aku pun I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
eh kau tahu tak actually kan sekarang the thing that we are doing now right aku feel macam deja vu tau aku feel like
aku pernah mimpi pasal this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
aku feel like deja vu sia ni
I will make it through lah as always dah nak dekat final year kan
but you know like I feel like I've been err apa ni stress eating tau
I mean when you are stressed you I I keep I keep like macam apa um
brody um brody pula err body project
then macam
macam he the guy is very
macam very inspirational ah very motivational nanti dia macam dia kelakar like every time like dia dah habis dia punya whole exercise kan nanti last last kan bila apa ni cool down kan nanti dia kasih macam those motivational speech nanti isteri dia will be like apa jer apa jer budak ni buat cause like dia punya speech is good lah because dia akan cakap things like
err okay the fact that you have err chosen this err this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that err you know that macam you know he's trying to say that err macam well done lah because like kau err kau decides to do this workout
in a way macam well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause dia orang ada macam the the workout varies tau dia macam ada forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
after forty minutes kau feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring macam kau feel like okay ya that's why aku take this this this whole
it was like six years ago but only recently macam dia orang famous I think
kau try ah one day ya
because recently okay aku tried macam the videos from six years ago and the videos lah recently
yang six years six years ago is like purely macam because I think dia orang just started out right so macam dia orang very err
very macam mana nak cakap eh macam very rigid very cardio cardio you know macam dia orang punya videos macam really okay thirty second nanti ada countdown gitu sekarang dah macam more chillax macam dia orang ada letak lagu
it's good lah macam kau joget and then lagu dia macam
so kau don't feel like you are actually exercising
ya especially now that you are working from home kau nak kena really seh have to make time
because aku just recently started doing the cardio kan then there's this whole whole week yang aku tak err felt well so I didn't do workout aku dia punya apa
dia punya exhaustion tu dia punya level of exhaustion boleh rasa seh because it's like
you know kau feel so tired then kau feel like macam lemah
you know so that's why aku rasa like you you have to like um
actually aku have this intention tau like every morning bangun
pergi jogging
ya but actually you macam we must tau because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like um
our health ni is really very important because recently I just bought a kau tahu yang the blood pressure punya monitor cause my mum few days ago dia sakit kan yang dia pergi doctor tu so she had like macam high blood pressure lah
it was really very high so macam mm the doctor suruh pergi suruh beli that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
beli ah then the past few days we've been checking our
then err my adik punya was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty gitu macam normal lah then my adik cakap eh tak kak tak tak err it is normal for me hundred and fifty lepas tu aku macam are you sure your are you sure it's normal abeh dia cakap kak I'm fat then aku
ya so aku macam oh is it cause
for me kan aku aku don't really bother about this kind of thing tau to be honest
ya so aku macam recently aku macam fikir eh actually really seh I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then kau tengok lah muka aku ni macam this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so macam
very sucky like you know like macam kau
because you can you can really see from your your face tau kalau kau really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why aku these few days aku feel like err really seh I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
ya true that's why lah aku cakap aku aku aku feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since err start online learning ni
cause aku feel like
to be honest macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa those facial punya benda ah serious aku moisturizer aku really very very very consistent sekarang aku dah macam
ah lantak kau ah aku really malas tau then aku sekarang
aku could feel so
menyesal ah aku really menyesal
hey you sure kau step jer you are saying this because you are my friend
eh no but I actually kan aku feel you should like makeover ah your room
no kau kena macam letak dari sana
but what colour was your light macam is it like the macam
but you also bought yang the the stars thingy right the constellation punya lampu
but tak macam
macam mana nak cakap eh macam kau tidur tak tak affected your sleep ke
bila kau nyanyi kan
tahu selalu nampak kau punya story
bila kau tengah aurora tu maknanya kau tengah nyanyi ah
kan kita kindergarten tak sama kan eh no sama
your kindergarten yang dekat sana tu kan
bukan oh your kindergarten kat gek poh
your kindergarten is under the punya kan
sama lah
but mine was like err near the pioneer area sana
or maybe tak lah maybe we met in err primary school
bila eh kita start
it's always like that macam kau bila kau in the same environment with the person kan kau tak kau tak macam close tau nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa kan nanti kau just randomly
pergi trip dengan dia lah pergi holiday dengan dia lah
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague dulu macam like when I was working with her
kita tak berbual langsung tau because
aku like macam kirakan assistant dia executive lah different roles kan because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder gitu so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
kita tak kita tak rapat then after I left then like tiba randomly kita because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then dia
dia macam random tiba-tiba dia ajak aku like pergi the one the one that I went perth with
and then the funny thing is like aku pergi trip dengan not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like kita tiga like considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth kita just clicked instantly tau
and then aku macam amazed because
it's just so macam orang cakap macam senang ah masuk
aku just be real dengan kau ah
kau tahu kan recently dia sakit
oh okay so it's really very way back ah okay okay so macam macam gini
dia sakit kan
it was err before he balik
okay so he sakit tekak and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like macam
err because he's okay not only his throat tau then he always has like macam ulcer
so we tried like natural remedies lah macam kasih dia minum like those um honey lemon kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu bonjela gel stuff like that
so he went back he went back home then err macam biasa kena quarantine and stuff like that then macam aku cakap dengan dia err you go jumpa doctor kat sana jumpa clinic kat sana cause first of all it's cheaper and and and kau at least like macam
err at least get to the bottom of it lah because if not you don't know what's happening kan because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working lepas tu dia pergi clinic kat sini pun
it's not working as well and then one thing aku geram pasal dia kan is that dia nak benda kan nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat like instantaneously tau
abeh aku macam eh come on lah like kau nak baik needs time to recover kan but dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik
where got such thing right so okay tu tak apa then he like err
but he balik
okay he balik then um he
he balik
and apa eh
he balik he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor cakap
err he has to go for like further check up dekat err specialists but it will take time
so right now he's actually on err renal diet ah renal diet ni macam um less salt less sodium less potassium kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku post dekat instagram yang gambar-gambar masak it was actually for him
I don't know eh macam sometimes recently aku feel like um
macam mana nak cakap eh okay you know I'm a very
err okay even though aku introvert kan you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when aku with him aku feel like aku
but emotionally because aku feel like
few months kan it's it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like aku trying
macam okay kau tahu aku sakit tangan
aku don't feel the support from him also
aku tak tahu ah macam recently aku feel like
apa eh nak cakap eh
dia cakap dengan aku ah he said um okay you know of my condition and stuff like that kan like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time aku was in err in a dilemma because
you know how um because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl yang macam
bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada you get what I mean
mesti ada ups and downs kan I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me macam do you still want to be with me despite my condition aku felt
guilty aku felt bersalah because macam oh because of his condition now abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia
okay aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun depressed ah maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
yang tadi aku jumpa tu I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I macam if I could turn back time sometimes I wish macam there are some exes yang aku shouldn't have let go
macam I should you know my yang the ex from err poly tu yang dia nyanyi tu
you know like macam I I want those kind of relationship yang macam
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently aku added him on err instagram and then like a few days ago ah no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message dia tau
but aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan message jangan cari pasal
like aku nak text but aku macam telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where aku felt like
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan the third party was my recent ex
so that's why aku like when I think about this whole thing kan aku feel like macam
I shouldn't have layan the ex man I mean I shouldn't have layan that third party
because you know you know that that time err during one of my um poly friend punya wedding kan we met
aku lupa tau aku honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then aku introduce macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I apa tu
cause dulu aku dengan dia okay lah a bit cheesy lah we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and aku I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know macam coupons that was my birthday like gift lah to him macam coupons macam
okay um redeem this to get a free dinner ah macam redeem this to get a free massage ah macam gitu you know
there's this book that I wrote tau aku dengan dia tulis err tak kita macam okay kau tahu macam paper kan lepas tu kita macam gunting then kita macam staple lah tepi tu macam make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you err what do you want to change in this relationship then macam appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then um apa ni err
I oh he wrote down that person name so like recently kan aku look through kan then aku realise oh my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then aku was like oh my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay lah because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you kan
I mean my ex yang best friend tu
err he was looking at me and then from dia macam dia tengok kan abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam
I don't know because okay lah recently okay aku be honest with dengan kau eh
ya online through err because kita friends again what on instagram
I tried to like macam talk to him and stuff like that but
err a conversation into me lah macam with me so macam dia
macam kita berbual then after that nanti kadang-kadang dia just seen tak reply gitu so macam so aku macam okay lah but
because I was thinking about it lah cause you know two of my exes aku came back to them right two of my exes and then it didn't work out what kan
then I was thinking kalau if I were to get back with this ex kan
like I remember merepek gila ya allah I don't know it was like macam I think it was after his performance or something
okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where kita naik tau he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat tu
abeh dah sampai buona vista eh was it buona vista
so I just left keluar gitu I just left like that
and I just leave him dekat seorang seorang and
I recently yang we got back I mean not we got back like I added I mean added him on err instagram kan ya ya he followed me back so
err aku dia
aku told him lah okay actually it was very funny because aku
can I be honest I say ya sure sure lepas tu dia cakap
err you are a very sensitive person gini gini semua abeh dia cakap um it's better kau boleh tone down sikit kau punya err sensitivity but I was reading it and I was triggered
you know macam you don't tell me not to be sensitive but okay lah aku appreciate his err feedback
tak actually seriously dia dia baik tau because kan um but dia pun sayang aku
baik lah cuma aku jer shitty
that's why aku
that's why I said tadi ah I was telling myself I said you know if I could turn back time
actually kan aku rasa kalau aku tak break up dengan dia kan aku rasa kita dah ada anak seh dah kahwin because kita okay lah ya in that book right we actually wrote err when to get married and stuff like that we actually plan to get married when kita twenty seven tau twenty seven years old so kau imagine
or at least two kids seh ya so sekarang macam aku dengan dia both
plans pun tak work out
I mean I've been wanting to do that actually but I just telling I was just telling myself like jangan main gila jangan main gila
but I think aku dream about him because I've been looking at his instagram story
err that time I found out he just putus tunang actually he's a very private person tau because that time he tunang then he didn't post his tunang face
so it was like dia tunjuk okay ah okay err yang gambar ni aku tak tak nampak because back then aku tak follow him yet but it was my friend lah who showed me that picture so it was like just a picture of a bouquet of flowers and a ring so ya lah to show that you know dia dah tunang
but recently yang kita met back tu at a wedding
aku aku random ah aku tanya dia eh mana tunang kau
oh dia macam oh err takde ah
then that's when I know he dah putus tunang
but I don't know whether he's seeing anyone or not because takkan aku nak cakap dengan dia eh kau seeing anyone ke tak you know like
actually macam aku fikir balik kan it's amazing how I remember all my exes punya birthday
kan aku I don't know what's wrong but I remember his birthday so I was thinking like mm maybe ada ada ada ada tu eh
mm ada lah end of january
ya so we'll see lah we'll see maybe maybe I will just like ask him ke like hey wanna grab a coffee
okay nanti nearer to his birthday kau remind aku this ah
because aku takut I will ask him the question instead
ya hopefully hopefully because like macam next year kan dia dah turn thirty kan
ya so like bila dia turn thirty tu orang cakap wiser a bit lah it's like throw away your twenties and then start thirty with something new
eh nanti kan dah habis just tekan yang tick tu tau
lepas ni I can't wait to eat our sushi
how can you forget dia kat depan jer seh
okay lah jap lagi lagi berapa minit jer actually it's like what almost it's only it's like one minute left seh

tinggi pe tingkat
kita kita uh kita ikut ah
tapi in tapi in uh dalam hati it's actually kita semua macam
ah macam mana uh best
best tak
hotel mana hotel mana you tinggal
oh uh oh kita tinggal hotel ni ni ni ah
you tak tahu ah itu hotel ah
um dulu ah saya punya bapa uh sudah uh uh apa ni
sembahyang kan dengan uh orang-orang uh orang-orang
ahli yang lain so what she was trying to say is that that hotel was known to be haunted where people actually killed themselves and know do ah they they hang themselves okay technically they kill themselves inside the hotel there were a lot of like scenarios in hotel so what the hotel did was
dia ah panggil uh ustaz buddha ah ahli-ahli ugama
untuk sembahyang kan the bilik to uh to sembahyang kan the hotel the blessed bless the hotel
speaking of orang kaya
ah okay kita
tapi kita selalu dengar macam uh macam kita dengar benda lah
okay bilik kita bilik hujung
okay the okay bilik the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu
leceh seh
kita okay kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam
we still when when we we kita share when kita kongsi story uh cerita ni dengan um
the shopping mall is just down bawah
ya you told me about your kakak
ya but your kakak cause your your kakak dah tidur
ayah dulu first kerja ayah kerja apa
wah kalau gitu ayah kerja lama seh adik tak boleh imagine seh kalau macam kerja lama gitu
sampai about how many years eh ayah kerja dekat alfa laval
sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun hais macam tak pernah dengar seh ah
so bila ayah kerja dulu dekat uh alfa laval then you don't think macam maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
memang dah planning kan dah kan
so ada apa yang macam very interesting tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke like the machine dia style tu
tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa sledgehammer
yang the the like the big punya sledgehammer itu ah
wah kira kan bagus seh pakai allen key jer senang seh
nowadays macam actually banyak like really a lot of things dia orang nak tukar
jadi macam manufacturing kan even macam sekarang
like now my workplace macam construction ah pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam manufacturing
ya ya ya ya actually true ah so macam dia orang ah actually dia orang nak buat kan benda tu ah datang jer kan
terus terus in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish ah
ayah rasa the houses eh because now they actually want to do a house
ah yang pagar kayu tahu the whole you imagine eh macam the whole building
mm actually kalau macam they use wood kan dia orang cakap ah it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like uh the wood banyak tapi macam macam uh the besi is steel kan dia orang kena mine
ah so that's why like uh kalau kayu kan senang dia chop jer lepas tu dia dia process
kan cepat habis dia punya plank tu banyak
sekarang macam dekat dalam news kan dia kan ada banyak cerita macam climate change ayah dengar tak cerita ni
macam dia cakap oh dia ada ah perubahan alam
ah dia ada tukar macam oh ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula ah you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly eh tempat tu tak banyak snow
oh yang itu ada ah
so kalau macam ayah
ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak over the years eh yang in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the udara ke or anything like that
so ayah rasa macam tak apa ah kalau dia lagi banyak shopping centre then
this climate change tu kira kan boleh boleh adapt ah
tapi ah so far ah ayah tak tahu anybody yang got this COVID right
so ah pada ayah macam yang this ah COVID ni ah ayah think will last how long
tapi dia orang cakap mm dia orang cakap mula mula it comes from china kan because like dia punya china tu dekat situ kan
dia orang ada dia orang they like to eat a lot of like macam weird weird punya animal tahu
oh so macam ayah fikir actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
ayah baca tak yang there's this uh group of people kan yang dia orang army plane habis lepas tu dia orang
ah dia orang fikir oh never mind lah because it's a private plane habis dia orang turun kan lepas tu yang eropah punya
the europe punya people say eh ah don't come because you're from ah please go home
ah ayah baca tak
oh ya dekat dekat eh the inside of the dormitory kan it's really uh it
according to my workers ah dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada ah but unfortunately lah kirakan kalau you're from china eh yang the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix dengan yang chinese because dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya tapi sekarang is like tapi of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the uh sickness because if not then people will be very macam macam racist kan dengan dia orang ah pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak ah actually
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad kan macam aku I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
oh is it abang abang punya party
oh the the khatam quran party is it
oh I don't remember kena check temperature actually
oh dah boleh clear ah
tapi ayah rasa like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada benda lain in yang ayah ingat ah that is the worst thing than this COVID
so uh apa tu jadi if now eh bila ayah tengok macam movie movie macam zombie zombie kan
ah ayah continue tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang kan now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak what story is like super takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang ah
tapi that cannibalism is not even fake seh it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story kan dia orang macam cepat gila kan like the they the they run you know
orang hantu apa seh itu
oh so you're actually like actually the actual human yang human yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada
so macam hantu biasa macam ah you can just
walk away ah katakan
tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah retire kan so ayah rasa freedom tak macam
I I don't need to care about like all this you know hantu or all these you people
so ah apa tu jadi bila ayah dah retire so after dah you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work ah macam gitu
so ah apa itu bila dulu kan ayah
um mula mula start kerja then you said that the kan ayah ada kerja kat tempat glass kan
ah so dulu dekat singapore dia ada banyak factory eh pasal I don't think sekarang ada company glass dekat singapore
dia punya cerita semua sama eh kena retrenched ah
macam kirakan fated ah
so sekarang kirakan macam free and easy
ah then everyday bangun and then just macam
uh buat itu ah uh if there's planning today then just buat jer lah gitu
so ayah rasa macam hidup gini all the way till the end okay ke tidak
so kalau actually eh macam sekarang kan dia banyak gila technology kan
ah ayah rasa technology ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam technology ni macam
susah kan nak cakap
dulu ayah favourite subject apa eh like when in school lah
so bila ayah when you read kan those kind of stories kan do you feel macam actually bila dia jajah satu country tu dia bagus ke um good or bad
so bila dulu uh kan yayi is actually malaysian right
oh yayi
oh actually so pasal tu nyai will come to singapore
so tapi yang that time yang yang yang apa tu the the separation kan
dia dia announcement ke apa
so it was actually senang gila seh
oh so actually you got lucky ah kirakan
so actually macam ayah pun tak march sangat ah kirakan
actually dulu pun like when I first err fikir kan like what to do kan actually I also wanted to join uh the army
because like the army macam to me macam dia semua macam easy ah kan
ah then lepas tu you you you can rise up the rank and then kerja dia macam not so bad lah
tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam army pun macam apa tu stoning kan dia orang ikut the rules and then
ah macam pelik kan it's like what what what's it for ah but I mean I can maybe understand lah dia orang semua nak untuk buat
like you're disciplined tapi there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
macam somehow dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu suddenly everything macam not so bad
quite positive kan ah macam oh you can remember the good times ah
ah it it like life is like that kan macam dulu like apa tu err that time when the adik dalam police eh oh my god sia
like so hot and then lepas tu dia punya push up don't say ah
ah dia punya push up dah apa tu wah sekarang sekarang nak buat push up macam gitu pun tak boleh seh tapi dulu wah you know so good you know
ah and then lepas tu dia orang and then dia punya army officer semua cara dia sama kan
ah dia
muka kirakan semua macam yang itu ah yang kak inah tak minat
so macam dia orang semua nak kena they have this macam angkuh punya muka ah eh
ah tapi tak tahu ah maybe it's just not fated ah that I you know that I didn't join the army ah forget it sia tengok
a'ah tapi bagus juga seh kalau hari hari pakai uniform senang seh like you don't need to think you wake up
ah so macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam MINDEF kan so like although he's in construction eh
dia nothing to do with him you know eh whatever that happen outside eh dia macam oh okay
macam MINDEF kan is very big so kalau dia orang if there's anything eh dia orang nak kena buat
ah in within the MINDEF itself ya dia orang mesti nak ada manager yang kat dalam yang boleh buat construction
macam ya like no feeling to scared ke takut ke kena buang kerja nothing ya
tapi ayah dah err I mean like I you speak to them sekali sekala ah at least
apa sal ada banyak secret ke
so mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya then uh too bad lah because like you're in warehouse pe
actually ayah dulu ada license apa eh
ayah ada license forklift kan
ya lah macam wasted money ah pasal call crane
ah lah pasal macam sama ah macam construction kalau ada crane masuk kan it's like oh my god seh
like dia orang semua like you cannot even walk there and then ya
ah actually servicing kebanyakannya is really buang habuk
dia dia buang habuk jer lepas tu nanti is if if really something wrong kan
ah dia cakap ah change part jer ah semua
maybe pun tak gerak seh pasal there's not much things kan sekarang
ya so sekarang macam the situation dengan si COVID ni is a bit weird kan pasal banyak benda macam just stop
pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang kan macam like ke apa tu yang the funny thing is that yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik ah habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru seh
ah is aku I don't even use the baju half of the time in pyjamas macam I pergi kerja pun pyjamas ha
dulu kirakan macam so bila ayah dah masuk warehousing tu then lepas tu like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard lah kirakan
ayah tak pakai itu ke umbrella
so it's like macam after you get out kan macam lain gila kan macam
itu ah kerja actually macam technical officer is actually pretty ah dia dia actually quite senang
a'ah so itu ah so tengok ah maybe adik pun will just become a technical officer ah
pasal kau if like you kerja all the way construction
is like lagi senang nak check orang punya kerja kan daripada nak buat you punya kerja sendiri
ah itu lah dia tapi actually sekarang kan dia orang banyak yang ah banyak
dia orang suka just berdiri and then suruh orang lain buat they don't want to go down themselves
itu yang masalah dia ah itu yang banyak yang macam singapore punya manager ah yang susah
I mm so you're saying like dia tak tahu ah actually
actually that's true ah itu yang dia punya the difference kan I think we talk about this before yang macam if you work for a
ah if the kalau dia punya engineer turun kan daripada australia ke apa then kalau kau tak turun dengan dia kan
ah then dia macam tengok engkau hello I'm going down sia you not going down meh gitu a'ah
ah tapi kalau macam singapore punya wah clean ah berdiri jer kasi yang the poor bangla eh ah
a'ah tapi tu tapi sekarang bangla semua pun tak ada
pasal sekarang pun dah ah semalam I met my friend
dia cakap on construction site kan cuma ada enam belas orang
adik cakap construction kau kau buat apa seh pondok
sixteen people to finish one construction wah bila masa nak habis sepuluh tahun pun tak habis
aku rasa a'ah satu swimming pool habis dia cakap no no no no I need to to build a school
habis adik cakap habis adik cakap dia punya school ni
dah setengah jalan ke or baru start baru start seh
tak cukup ah ah habis dia orang cakap ah they keep saying eh macam oh ah they giving green light green light
tapi yang green light ini actually belum
uh still go to the construction site mostly all cannot ah itu dia punya problem ah
ah so ah itu yang I don't know when to finish ah dia punya project habis dia orang kita so macam sixteen eh
habis kau imagine eh macam nak carry benda tapi nak kena distance uh tak boleh kan very weird lah dia punya rules
ah tapi tak tahu ah ini bila nak habis kan mm so tengok ah macam mana
tapi apa tu ayah ayah tengok tak yang macam yang dekat america banyak orang tak nak pakai mask
tapi pelik kan I don't know why macam dia orang err apa tu really really go against err apa tu dia ah nak pakai mask ni padahal pakai mask tu macam tak ada apa apa per
ah I don't know ah when when is this going to end pun really not sure
ya so tengok ah apa tu harap harap everything is okay lah kan
so tak tahu ah tengok ah macam mana habis mummy tak cakap apa apa ke
yang pasal yang macam COVID ini ke apa
ayah ada berapa banyak seh
wah dah dah dah planning ah
chey pasal dulu kan apa tu kan susah kan nak dapat singaporean
ten years tak boleh masuk malaysia apasal eh
so is apa untuk tunjukkan like you're patriotic ah kirakan
oh so dia dia really macam nak uh apa tu
tapi kalau macam if you go back kalau then you must take some some
letter ke atau pun macam tak atau they just tak tak tak consider you as patriotic ah
oh so kirakan macam apa tu dia dia really control lah ya
mm habis nyai is nyai singaporean
so dia bila dia convert seh
oh on the independence day itself dia boleh convert tapi apasal ayah tak convert
macam there is something ah to show like you really want to be a singaporean lah
bila ayah first uh cakap that pledge eh tapi ayah ayah sekolah pun kat singapore so it's not that hard lah
ah yang itu actually adik pun kena buat lah benda tu oh zaman zaman silam kan a'ah

tapi kau kat dekat sana kau tak puas so instead you go for the whole singapore
and lina pula be like why you doing this who will kill me

the doctor said that because I went to check out from my eyes what the doctor cakap tau apa is because aku rabun too much then the skin is lose then the muscle is weak so what I have to do is
rendang kenapa seh
tapi kalau you makan rendang selalu like wouldn't you get like too sick of it
like kalau for me kalau I makan rendang hari hari or like
it's like jelak seh
tapi I don't like I don't like to makan
to me kalau nak makan rendang kan
just makan dengan ketupat je
I don't like serunding
no lah I don't like serunding
okay with rendang but I don't like serunding
wah if I can only eat one dish for the rest of my life I rasa kan
a bit a bit susah leh
I think ayam lemak cili api
ayam lemak cili api or kari ayam
kari ayam hm
kari ayam kari ayam if my mom masak
because because right wah her kari ayam is
kari ayam power gila babe is power gila like dia punya pedas is just nice abih makan dengan sambal belacan then
dengan nasi oof
power gila ah
I think the idea of curry noodles is bad like imagine you lemak letak cili api and then you letak
mee mee dalam ee like
lemak cili api other than that what what do you want to eat
dia punya tarik abih dia punya daging dia punya lah soft punya lah
banyak you know dorang bagi banyak abih dorang punya soup pun like sendu gila is it sendu
macam oof macam sedap like
no macam
thick is it thick like tebal
pekat ah pekat
sendu is it sendu or seru
what is the most pettiest reason that you macam
satu orang buat kan like like kalau dorang buat then you macam tak suka
macam you don't like ah like like it's like you're petty like you really macam nak tempeleng gitu
I think right for me right wah I don't like kalau kalau dorang gedik
kalau perempuan oh my god kalau kalau like any if I see this minah eh this girl come up to me macam
cakap like
eh punya lah ee macam nak
macam nak lempang je seh
like I want to hit her I want to like ee like ee can you not be so gedik a not
and then another thing is like kalau dorang macam
like dorang macam step step
dorang macam world lah world lah macam
macam world lah
like dorang macam they're like
ah ah ah macam dorang bebual terus macam eh aku aku like aku pernah seh pergi kat sini pernah seh do this do that macam like
oh I got like hit up by girls at this club you know macam
ah macam macam big macam world ah world haprak gitu ah
cuba try cuba try
oh macam dia macam like oh like like ah ape tu
macam like I'm better than you tapi actually tak lah tak lah better sangat
macam I more better but then actually you not that better lah
kita party lah sia
I think kita
kau tak payah kerja kalau we don't have to work right
what do we do I rasa we enjoy
kita party
kita macam buat hal masing masing I think we will achieve our dreams ah
I think that is for sure macam
bill bill yang nak bayar ni semua
kalau we don't have to work then don't basically macam
the only reason why we work is nak dapat duit kan
buat hal masing masing ah
we achieved our dreams like we macam finally enjoy life why what what I would say
tak ada makna ah gitu
macam tak ada makna meaningless lah
tak ada challenges ah
basically time lah I think yang the most issue for my
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like oh nothing but to me I rasa macam twenty four is like oh my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I kena kahwin kena beli rumah
to me the only factor that I rasa that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to macam
ya but at the same time macam they still like if to me that those are like lucky people macam dorang macam
bertuah lah to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though dorang dah macam tua tua gitu macam forty plus tapi macam masih dapat
dapat buka apprenticeship
buat ni semua like
but at the same time kalau asyik asyik kena
macam like if you always like you know kalau you always work work hard je asyik asyik work hard abeh lepas itu macam
macam tak ada tak ada luck like people don't like it's just not your bidang lah it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try masak you try restaurant
retail abih you try ah apa lagi ah engineering abih lepas itu
you don't know you nak buat apa
so macam you'll never run out of things to like
betul juga ah betul juga ah
what you say ada ada sense
kalau you cannot minta for like more wish
okay so my first wish I rasa I would be eternally rich
so I can beli anything that I want
macam at least macam treated as human beings lah
at least macam in terms of salary in terms of of the will
kaum lelaki tengok kita basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
but the thing is memang betul lah darjat wanita dah naik kan memang tinggi lah di islam tapi
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since kita kecil sampai sekarang dah besar pun
kalau kita nak macam you know like cakap example like wedding my friend
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because ah suami dia is apa itu anak seorang
they want to buat besar besar because they are only going to have one wedding ever
kan membazir and then like to her she feels like she don't need lah because most of the people she won't she won't even kenal
and then at the same time macam in at the same time you so you follow lah if you mampu ke tak betul tak
uh ideal matches to be kahwin
must be soft spoken must be so macam
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there macam like
yeah I like like went through whatever yang kesakitan all this nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam
is at the same time macam you do have like some of this
regret macam eh kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap yes kat dia macam
okay for the third wish kan
kita kena make it a fun one
kita kena macam as merepek ah tapi macam like
like jangan serious sangat ah
so kirakan I can masak any makanan that I want
entah eh
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to ikut recipe
I for me I don't really macam I tengok recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't macam ikut one tablespoon
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I tak ikut
you know I mean agak agak is like fun leh it's like oo you know you are making a portion or you like making something like oh it's a hit and miss like oh if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more gula and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like macam like that time I masak sambal tumis telur eh sambal tumis like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs dengan
buat sambal tumis tapi kan tak ada bawang merah tau like there's no onions
so I decided to use bawang putih
and to me because mummy kata
bawang putih is like a good alternative and also like you know bawang putih is more flavorful macam kalau you masak nasi goreng if you don't have bawang putih it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important lah basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much lah because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
and then I did macam lada kering
and all that jazz and then after that I tengah masak kan
and then I was just like I feel like dia punya
bawang putih punya taste macam still overpowering you know
so I letak sugar and then it was like uh
so I put then I put kicap and then I put uh it was like a it was like a frenzy ah it was like a
like a carnival like basically macam
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just campak kat dalam
yes imagine you ask me for rendang
I can cook any rendang you want rendang johor rendang penang rendang sarawak
italian rendang you want the crispy rendang
rendang and yes I want uh the skin of the chicken is not crispy you know
ugh serious nye
appreciation so far macam like Singapore nights festival all this
you're going to say about the penang right the padang kari that we had in Thailand right
oh my god okay jap jap jap
apa eh okay you say yours first ah
bukan kita nak pergi ice skating ke
and leisure park sana
no kita nak pergi bowling ke apa
atas tu ada ada movie
kenapa kenapa lah manis sangat diabetes tau
then kita makan Nandos dekat berjaya time eh
apparently I kena santau
yeah I kena santau abih lepas tu I tak ada mood apparently my mum said I was someone else then I diam je then my mum belikan makan I didn't even touch it I didn't even eat it then mum hold me ah she felt like my body was ice cold
and then she was like like she baca baca all this
apparently after we left after we leave the punya mall right then then I was okay already then I rasa lapar then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay lah let's go eat dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa like some
macam sikit sikit/malay lah like
where mummy masak me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday
because like mummy right she only masak bila birthday for the rest of my sisters
but my birthday right she always masak macam sotong
or macam kari ayam lemak cili api macam this kind of but she never masak any birthday for me then I feel like eh
how come never masak me birthday then I ask ah mummy never masak me birthday for me ah
then she say you you want you nak is it then I cakap ya
then she masak me birthday and then I sakit on that day
okay what how how bodoh is it
if one horse size otter eh that one seram seh
tapi kalau hundred otter size horses
kecil kecil macam miniature gitu
ya ya ya that's true you like tendang tendang tendang then it keeps on coming back
yeah that's true that's true I think ya I think I also ambil the
is macam macam imagine kalau you jumpa lipas abih besar punya ee seram nya tapi tapi like
tak sanggup tak sanggup one is enough
yeah I think gila seh
tak ada orang yang boleh ambil dia ah like tak ada orang boleh defeat dia ah even thanos you know even thanos like start ask the army to rain down
apart from rendang if you talking about like metaphorically
kalau if you talking about food I think I will get uh kari ayam
I already say kan
kalau metaphorically I think right I'll get
a bit too sassy lah macam that's why I think people don't like
like macam macam okay a bit world ah I guess
no lah but it's more of like okay like arrogance as as in macam
entah eh arrogance as if like I'm a bit too over confident
entah eh
merepek lah what you mean intimidating you not intimidating at all lor
no as in macam is not even like you not even intimidating lorh
yeah I'm I'm talking about macam or you talking about work ah
ya but if you have to kalau you nak kena pilih satu je
Jollibee atau Arnold's
simple gila dok
ya lepas I think we can we go again
ah belum buka lagi
I think central kot like
ya dia punya fries dia punya cheese tak lokek seh
gila dia punya dia punya cheese

mm fikir fikir
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your muka haprak but then your personality is nice then okay lah
and if you manage to macam you know capture me with your humor then
topic topic perbincangan
cause yellow is a good energy punya
like you look at yellow then you just like oh you know sedap mata memandang gitu
so macam
turun a bit the pain threshold
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you rasa macam
macam like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
and resale and kahwin everything
itu lah you don't have to worry
nanti what if you jadi pervert ke apa
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then macam blackmail them
entah dia macam merepek ah
dia macam world ah I guess
to me dia macam world sikit ah
ya dia macam tak serious come on man you are the avatar man
I rasa tak keluar tak tau ah
for so macam tinggal
tapi monday I have to like upload
I mean macam I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
everybody else dorang tak macam explore tau dorang macam just do one that one that one that one that one that so macam
I don't know how they can just like not explore lah I I like exploring I like to macam
yeah I like to macam
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more macam you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so macam
cause it's sunday kan
but I feel like this year macam I don't think they they should actually have
merepek ah like who comes up with this stuff
ya but at the same time and then like you you then dorang kata dorang nak do salute eh for nurses
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus macam at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
ya macam sausage all this kena potong potong kadang kadang pun I macam makan
okay lah is it bubble tea or macam Boost
kan I think so I also prefer Boost
ya then sometimes you just feel like like example macam you pergi interview that time I gi interview then after that I just
one tudung one mascara one false eyelashes
the tudung is the most expensive it's four dollar
you gave me yesterday you saw right I wear that green tudung and it stick
oh my god so semangat

okay kejap I feel like I want to go shopping eh oh my god but my my bank account is going to drop
my mother will give me a long lecture about how rezeki mesti halalkan
but I mean now can still work also what but I think they just cari hal lah just because the business is going down
bodoh kan
what the habis orang yang nak cari duit
so jerry asyik menyakat dia apa then sometimes tom also will menyakat jerry
and like oh my god I'm so interested but at the same time it's haram
aku nak beli baju sia but at the same time also kan waste money bro I want to go shopping

alah gitu pun ada
I don't know lah where they want to go I just ikut jer
so tomorrow what's the plan kau datang rumah aku kau belajar lepas tu kita makan
oh kalau tak accepted habis dia tak bayar eh
okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams cita-cita saya nak pergi ke australia untuk continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat important
pasal kalau ibu um susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya cause saya anak yang paling last
so for ayah
ayah is quite easy you know
you know but like when I was supposed to go saya not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
so tak boleh yang typical macam invisible
oo tu susah
okay awak awak jawab dulu
okay awak nak jadi macam spy kids lah
mmhmm masukkan makanan dalam oven terus boom dah siap is it
awak tak sangka kan tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu
iya lah
as you got wow now after we think ya masa tengah fikir ni
allah ada timing eh okay
ten years ago saya dapat jumpa sekarang
kan yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang okay
ya pasal saya suka collect gambar-gambar lama
ya sama macam ibu collect collect collect
mm tiga belas ya
saya tengah secondary one
a'ah macam jer cause
ah cause after second year third year habis
sama-sama lah kita macam
nak buat kawan susah lah
tak buat apa-apa pun ya pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai telephone
ya tapi saya tak boleh tidur often it's cause
uh student leader saya student leader
ya saya student leader
tapi in your secondary school
sekolah yang paling tinggi cause my school is more of a like a music school
siapa yang suka first of all
ya saya kena um bully about my looks
macam compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause dia macam carefree at that point
right you macam tak kisah
pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam it's okay
dalam sekolah apa eh
saya paling suka during saja
makanan is
simple makanan simple
like it's cause tak mahal
nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat but
kau pergi east kan
jawapan saya is the dua dollar
dekat dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde
dah tutup it's cause before I graduate I heard that uh they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall tu dengan bubble tea I ingat
saya tak fan
itu yang belakang drink stall eh
ya I remember I asked them before maggi apa dia orang pakai just cause
nak try buat kat dalam kat rumah
macam tak boleh make it tak tahu
saya rasa saya chef bob awak rasa
awak chef wan saya rasa saya tak mampu
and you know me apa-apa you kasih I I makan jer
I tak tanya apa benda saya makan jer
inshallah benda tu halal inshallah tu halal
oo soalan yang susah
wow sensitive question dia
uh waktu secondary school kan
wow I know I am I macam macam-macam lah since ah macam macam macam dari primary school it's if primary school I
it's like netball sama dia punya rules is sama macam netball
exactly the same cuma dia punya um the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
ya very complicated tapi saya buat and then I also did
um benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya
I nak beli air
cause it's recess time of course saya nak beli air so I pergi canteen seorang-seorang
beli air terus ada this random girl came
and then I look at her cause I macam lost kan apa seh dia ni berbual
saya tengok dia I macam huh and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
okay after that selepas itu dia buat lagi and lepas tu dia buat publicly
dia depan-depan orang you know but after she did that she walked away eh no and then she said uh pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
saya macam tercungap tu kan so I tak tahu nak buat apa
so I just masuk dalam kelas balik then I macam just doze off cause
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time kalau you ingat like myspace blogspot was a thing
abeh macam tadi you cakap oh student
tak necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause kalau adulthood we don't usually care about people right
if dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual you know what I mean
but bila secondary school it's hard cause you have to
soalan apa susah lagi saya tak tahu macam mana nak fikir
just give myself confidence pasal kalau pasal saya insecure
and only if I had a bit of confidence to just kick out my insecurity saya rasa macam everything is gonna be okay
no saya pun tak tahu nak cakap apa
uh suka hati apa orang nak cakap saya percaya apa awak cakap
everything is susahnya soalan awak
bosan kan

I think ah I don't actually remember seh I think hor wah I think I just go makan man I go makan but sad lor makan only five people per table mah so everyone have to sit far far apart like now also you want go makan see everybody also sit so far apart
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
to be honest ah aku ni boleh consider ah ada obsession sikit singaporean ah typical bubble tea wah when they announce ah that bubble tea closing wah jialat I already like stress eh cause like how I don't know how long they reopening what then I tried to find like other ways that I can like sub to my bubble tea wah nothing beats to it eh legit I then I just wah keep thinking of it pastu bila dia dah buka nak beli tengok queue dia tak apa ah kirim salam you leh do you drink bubble tea
eh tu sedap seh ya actually kan aku nak sub tu untuk aku punya bubble tea tau bila circuit breaker then wah jialat that one also close everything close then I don't know what to drink anymore then I think ah the circuit breaker ah was like diet to me

tak eh sedap tak
oh abeh entah eh aku macam nak beli pun macam berat hati seh mahal seh uh abeh kat sekolah kau aku selalu dengar dari sekolah kau orang selalu beli bubble tea sedap ke bubble tea dia
I don't know eh to be honest ah I don't really like my school food cause first day my I I I know your school got like student price right my school standard price leh for public also then it's quite pricey then also ah not a lot of halal food then want find halal food cannot really find anywhere then maybe hmm like can only eat like McDonald's like that one easy ah halal but if you go food court that all ah quite difficult then hari hari makan nasi ayam ah then don't know eh got try my school food before
wah jialat I tell you ah wah if can ah I want buy roller blade sia it's damn far it's like my school is one end to the other end cause last time ah dengar dengar ah dorang kata my sekolah building burn down so dorang nak reclaim dorang letak at a new place ah so dorang letak new place tu dorang letak kat belakang then wah punya lah jauh like katakan eh you thought ah you thought you reach school early but wah you still reach class late but luckily my class got fifteen minutes grace so like okay lah can still use that fifteen minutes to jalan jalan your school leh your school so spaced out seh it's not besar but I think it's quite spaced out not far meh from one class to the other
but your school ah a bit weird leh cause like if see from in front ah quite small padan ah got behind behind some more quite complicated leh don't know how you can like learn how to find your way around
eh but right I know your school ah a lot of people just go there wah say only ah study always tell parents study but actually they don't really study one ah confirm like only merayap here merayap there then walk here walk there only you irritated or not
eh but sekerang tengah COVID ni tak ada orang kick you out ke you still can study at school meh
hmm but okay lah at least not like a lot of student now so so a bit better you all still got a bit more space then some more ah COVID now also you all kena separated must sit far far apart right
eh how your nenek ah like she cannot go out she at home only ah
wah not bad ah your nenek can know how to use this atas atas app
okay okay no wonder I was about to like wah so atas this one nenek modern is it then like your other family member leh they go out they work from home or go out also
hmm so like that nobody at home your nenek find more chance to keluar lah
then do you prefer her lama one or sekarang one
hmm then favourite makanan like masakan dia what for you
hmm then kau often tak tolong dia kat dalam dapur
but tak salah your area semua dekat dekat jer kan
oh abeh usually you all walk or like what
hmm but okay lah at least you with your nenek is it then you got friend then you can talk talk like that
hmm then wah did you miss your nenek cooking when you go school or what
dan hari ni kita akan berbual tentang anything under the sun
school sekolah
super senang apa lagi
like is it fun ada kawan-kawan ke tak
abeh kau punya time table like how is your
is it banyak time untuk relax atau tak
abeh pukul berapa what like what time is your lesson
oh ya I saw like I always see your Instagram like kau macam penat gila because you always like
abeh aku wave at you and you literally didn't you ignored me bro I was so sad
no aku literally waved at you
embarrassed kan ya aku pun I felt so malu because of that
that time aku remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl pakai tudung exactly same as you
err I aku aku not mad at you aku mad at the situation because aku was so embarrassed aku malu gila I was down the block
I saw uh cause it was at night malam-malam so aku saw this lady
she was wearing her tudung and she was in the dark
wave paling besar di dalam dunia like literally like this
macam tak kena gitu situation gitu
ya so for me sekolah aku I think it's super senang to go to school because I don't have to take a bus
aku tengah flex right now ya
ya cause now my school kalau kau nak masuk kau nak kena ada dia punya card like the specific card
measures no uh no as in in terms of the zones like for your school kau ada zone like different different zones
yang colour biru merah orange
the only my school has mala at uh food court empat
ya tu pun
oh kita punya junior eh
oh dia makan mala
ya ya tapi kita boleh masuk ke tak
but the thing is mala at causeway point macam mahal gila
I don't know if it's mahal gila eh
no tapi um I told amira then I um err apa jaz
jaz she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause dia tak makan the daging semua the daging is a mistake
who eats the daging you just go for the
that doesn't count as daging that counts as one of those processed meat macam spam daging is like literally daging yang macam masak tu
of course it's gonna be mahal it's like duck meat err
remember duck meat punya ramen that we ate at the apa
I was asking my bapa cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like oh can I suggest then I was like oh can we eat at the ramen and then he was like err I'll think about it then we never eat
was it one of those like lemak
oh ya sebab kau punya stomach kan ada problem sekarang
kesian baby
uh sebab you're like a baby you can't like handle the full Samyang experience that sounds like a
macam like the gravy ah
I don't I don't get why you don't like the carbonara one carbonara one is literally like the best punya flavour
man aku baru makan Samyang on is it yesterday or two days ago
is it because you never leave it inside for a longer time because I like my Samyang to be like puffy what's the word macam like
oh I don't know why but semalam aku macam on a
university punya rush so I was like looking at all the
ya because I aku fikir uh I really don't have a choice but to like look through siapa lia punya boyfriend sekarang dekat kan
what was his his course ah or should I ask like lia to ask him about dia punya experience
ada banyak mm
dorang take in like
ya kau tak kau tak research ke
then lepas poly kau nak buat apa
you actually like oh so kau macam like committed ah in that sense okay
uh aku scared yang dorang tengah trying to convince you to spend more money by the way they say it
she ya you should just since kau ada connection might as well just take advantage of it ah
dekat singapore
kerja kat perth ah
jangan world ni dah dah start ni dah start dah start
tadi tadi macam like on a you're still on the ground tapi ni a bit like floating
you I thought your mum ada your mum kasi
or I thought she was the one yang ada attachment punya issues dengan kau
macam like my kawan elisa
dia pun like thinking of
yang half malay half chinese yang whose in my classmate
oh tu tahu okay um elisa dia selalu kata but to her ma yang oh
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her kakak is like big
so dia mak dia selalu like oh then I'll come with you lah macam gitu
cause mak dia is quite to tua lah ya
and she said it okay okay she did lah it wasn't kinda like show off show offy punya manner
so aku then I was like aku macam shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense lah because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people aku macam so intimidated
it's uh sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture lah our punya course punya culture like no one is like
we're like so sikit
punya orang if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
kau punya course banyak orang y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
tak tahu err but I think she's still going for the
apa macam plan like have like one whole like plan for like dorang punya rest of their lives
after poly dorang gi university then after that apa kerja sikit then
so like whenever I'm with her aku macam like intimidated sikit ah sebab aku selalu kan aku ada going with the flow punya attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do lah I think it's my intern lah you were right what you were saying apa
kau punya comment lah like huda I'm so proud of you
pergi overseas
tapi dia like pandai enough to go for local uni ah so I'm not too worried about her
uh I think her overseas dream is untuk like
like kerja sana
ya sebab dorang ada minimum wage semua
I mean kau ada
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest semua the
ya I think the realisation that kita macam like growing up just like hits
oh sebab ada dina
ah foundation or whatever tak tahu
I want to learn more about like apa
aku nak belajar more about macam like social work gitu
when I went for my intern I really like felt macam like left uh not left out lah I just felt
not in the social work ah kan aku bilang kau social service organisations semua
tu like in the
kalau all fails I I can be like a teacher kau pun nak jadi teacher
cikgu kan
cikgu aliah
I mean like aku aku knew that I had like interest in like
kerja for like the community gitu like I like to give back to the society gitu because like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like macam boring and like
I really like at the end of the day aku macam like
macam apa haziq
haziq dia pergi apa kau tahu yang internship yang international
but then sebab
the overseas punya internship it was supposed to be overseas
ah tak tahu pula
ya tapi sebab dia kan like
dia he okay okay so
I know kau kind of like sceptical pasal dia punya like wealth
tapi uh elisa like dia explain to aku like dia punya how
in this like manner maybe kau macam like believe
so dia millionaire sebab
he would like his family would like invest in like oil punya stocks
apa return investment I'm like aku macam like a terrible
hundred thousand which should like deduct to be like sekarang kau believe tak
ni ni on like um oil
dorang kaya dorang like old money
cause sebab uh apa
on last friday tu aku I had to do like a sharing
sharer there who's like an punya student tapi haziq was there also and I'm like ugh
ah nanti aku show kau I was like talking about pe
you know aku pulled out all the I pulled out all the cards macam
and then he also talking about his internship ah tapi really kesian dia lah dia macam kau
apa cause about COVID then he had to like
come back to singapore gitu
kau cancelled immediately sebab was like in a mess
tapi this one was like indonesia was still like okay lah singapore indonesia boleh pergi because it was like in the same like circumference
so they ah pergi lah but then
after that they were like err this is worst than we expected you have to come back then gitu
because your one is apa macam tourist punya management so you you had to like have people there
this one was like business so everything could have been done online lah so it semua makes sense ah I'm
be tapi aku didn't like expect there's like oh
kau nak cakap pasal addison rae
I think that's like her brand lah that's macam apa jojo siwa
oh ya allah
then kau jangan kau jangan tengok video dia lah it's like she's not forcing you to watch her video
like I saw dia buat yang makeup punya video yang dia buat like clown
tak tahu lah
tak tahu lah I just see jer
wait aku Google avani net worth sekarang
oh dia tu takde like takde dia punya it
whoa kau kau memang critical of her eh
she's ni budak kecil
ya allah you're too critical of this show eh
dah kau punya addison rae punya sharing dah habis
would I love to talk to her but if I know like aku someone sikit
like dia he can talk lah
so but james sekarang kan dia ada banyak like years of experience sebab dia kan he was like he was the cover girl
he was the first like male punya cover girl so he went for a lot of apa talk shows dengan ellen semua
you know so kau you need to like be like
baik like kinder to them sikit lah please
tapi dorang famous
kau nampak yang TikTok punya
coffee punya tu manis oi and I was like seeing like four pumps of like mocha you know you saw that one
I aku aku bilang kau kan yang coffee kadang kasi aku macam anxiety so aku macam aku sangat
it's like I think uh cause I think aku ada break from coffee sebab I was like
kat rumah the whole time so I didn't like really was like
then after that uh I think a couple of weeks ago when I texted you was the first macam like
time minum coffee then aku my anxiety was like I had like I was so anxious
and then suddenly aku macam like so like scared
that day aku minum coffee day lah because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
macam you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
sekarang aku really cannot minum coffee again
which is sedih cause I love the taste of coffee you know how much I love like the taste of coffee
was it because of anxiety or apa
kau bodoh eh that's like the worst
kau macam better lah so
tapi tak pernah pass out
the day you actually pass out then you're like oh huda aku pass out I'll be like
kau nak pass out kan pass out lah
I guess now sebab aku tak boleh minum coffee then it should be easier for both of us ah so whenever Starbucks ada one for one I will never ask you
best punya
because uh aku try the LiHO punya pun
um it just doesn't hit as much as Sharetea punya oo
the matcha doughnut yang aku beli that day
it was so sedap sebab aku popped it in the microwave for like ten seconds it

ya dia date untuk
like she wants them to act way more mature for their age dia ada dia punya expectations
terlalu high
and she's she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when apa dorang kat poly ke serving
you know kita tengah sekolah
is it sebab dia desperate to like

and safirah couldn't help but falling for him at least sekarang dia over him lah but now she has this guy

no leh it's more of like I have to jaga this baby
ya aku memang mimpi pasal baby banyak ah aku tak tahu apa pasal but in real life aku memang macam tak nak anak ah
mm ya lor but then aku suka budak-budak apa and I like to spend time with them but I don't know right ya yes
cause aku dulu suka buat macam that kind of like diary entry like from that year or whatever
very like ya reflective and macam gini
all right lah yang benda-benda bodoh ah macam
aku rasa aku masih dengan azee seh
so aku aku just dengan kawan aku aku remember ya about her and then like
ya lor but then um ya aku rasa
like are you still friends with that girl the kawan aku kan uh but like
but dulu sec four kau ada macam mimpi-mimpi eh impian-impian ke
see lah my english all berterabur already
mm I think very small things like kalau
orang tu macam tak text aku balik or what I think aku fikir yang bukan-bukan but then I aku macam don't act on it lah but sometimes I'll I'll be
even though you think maybe it's something personal but kau try to
a'ah satu hari tu kat bus aku tak tahu kalau kau ingat ke tak aku tweet pasal perempuan ni kat bus habis dia macam
tak nak jalan babe dia macam tak nak give aku way habis
in the end like dia tak nak duduk dia tak nak duduk tak apa tapi banyak seats kat belakang then bila banyak seats kat belakang aku geram lah macam apasal kau tak nak kasi aku jalan eh
and then me being passive aggressive aku macam
okay lah tak apa ah aku just diri habis aku jeling-jeling kat dia
then terus bila orang turun dia duduk dekat depan babe
at last dia duduk so pun tak apa
aku tak tahu maybe around like younger than me
she saw me she saw me and then dia macam nak buat macam you know muka yang macam
mm step tak nampak aku gitu
aku stare dia seh aku dah macam minah red aku dah keluar habis
habis what about you
aku rasa macam you're the least petty person ever
or like me zaman dulu lah because
ya ya bila aku dengan zee I mean like this girl nama apa eh nama dia apa eh aku lupa tapi dia kawan zee
then this girl dia macam tak nak tegur aku tak nak say hi even though I said hi to her so I don't know her personally what right
exactly it's because dia cakap ah apa ni aku date zee that's the reason why she don't like me even though I'm julie's friend
nasib baik buat apa call aku eh
dah lah it's okay lah don't have the red one lah
but then ex kau yang lagi satu
okay but if if I were to choose I think aku nak macam to be able to speak
and also kau boleh baca quran babe
I can play ah but sikit-sikit jer it's not like mastered level tahu ah
oh ya I got the semangat one
but kau tahu berenang
aku tahu float jer
err about james charles dia kan suka nyanyi tapi nyanyi dia macam tak sedap kan so he went to a vocal coach
allowance berapa lama ni
sixteen seconds bodoh bagus
siapa seh aku nak jadi I'm already an actor myself in real life I think normal
apasal seh
aku tahu tapi I didn't like
so it's like okay lah kan nothing wrong with that but I think because we older already so we don't really macam judge too harshly
like you wake up as them but you're still yourself rabak though then suddenly I can speak malay
that will make the news you know wah stray kids can speak malay one tiba-tiba
like tak payah pergi kerja ah
ya I think aku so
aku rasa aku kasi therapy ah
tapi are we allowed to talk about singapore like that
out of the boss gitu lah
itu lah
tapi kita tak tahu what type of zombie
gigi siol putih
tapi kau boleh tak dah hafal channel dah hafal cerita dah hafal script
dry and terkopek and already putih
ya you will lose melanin and then like kau jadi putih ah

so imagine you in a crowd you already rimas
then ghosts lagi-lagi hari-hari tengok kau macam eh and kau boleh nampak sia ke apa ee
I only know one guy dia boleh macam dia memang boleh nampak but dia and you can kind of see dia macam claus dia macam depressed dia macam mm ya
so macam kesian ah
but he's very like I think he has that since young lah so dia macam dah biasa in a way but
ya I know lah some of them macam they everytime will find an opportunity to just say eh kat belakang kau ada benda or whatever but I can tell lah that is fake lah
I think I tak tahu lah maybe dia orang gila ah nak attention but then why would you want attention that way
like I remember that time I met my boyfriend there and then he was like eh kau tahu tak boyfriend kau ada macam lembaga hitam dekat belakang dia then I was like
apasal eh lembaga hitam dia cakap dia ada something lah kat like his aura or something
ya it was like twirling like mario macam bagai
I was twenty twenty three he would be twenty dia nineteen eighty nine so berapa tu
uh he's the same lah tak ada apa-apa lah dia ex yang paling boring untuk aku

tapi I haven't really like used it fully because circuit breaker
bila kita jewel ah
okay lah itu enam kali ah
lepas ni so sekarang tak boleh okay
not all also lah cause dia orang cakap macam terbelit-belit also still
so tak faham pun but
kasih dengar the autotune
err my I think the only like studio that can fit that is neapolis atau infinite eh studios I don't know
and he went to korea without like any money or anything so macam
and he tak even go for like classes to belajar you know he just like
if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle dia orang punya
if you ikut macam the business like module
ya the food punya
itu jer
macam you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
ambil and try
tak bagi like anybody just masuk tahu so you have to like
queue to masuk
sakit everything they keep saying they keep separating
satu is one species another one is another species
if there's fifteen migrant worker yang kena
they are exposed to tak akan migrant workers jer kan
everyday macam add one two people like in the community cases kan
macam some kind of investigative like journalist gitu
and then we all will mati together
I don't know macam as we grow older I guess
what the world is then we get macam
aku lagi penat daripada kau you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
ya pasal lah penat
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film penat sia
there's this macam
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which mazhab you're looking at also
pasal if you're talking about
like kita punya mazhab memang we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
there's other mazhab that's like
like this idea of mazhab is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
that's like my question because the mazhab thing came about because of
macam concerns lah
then is the mazhab thing going to change or what
a set in stone thing cause the mazhab thing was never like set in stone
people there might adopt our mazhab punya practices
she will be adopting other mazhab practices and when she comes back here
just about sembah this one tuhan
and believing in our prophets our rukun iman and rukun islam
touching a dog is haram so ya that's like my
macam over
to be fair kasihan ah dia dia macam
sec one lepas tu kena COVID terus tak ada friends you know she don't have proper friends in school
this is like there is a goal punya cerita after that
and she had this other boyfriend and the boyfriend she was together for like five years tahu
the whole family was like oh dia dia minum arak dia pergi
apa dia makan drugs semua that kind of thing you know and then when we met him I was like he was crying
ah you tak tak ada choice lain ke apa like
you know I macam
that lady was cantik lah and she was with us for three years
like kau tak ada perempuan lain ke apa that you want to go for this maid who doesn't want you back
I'm like kau dah tua stop it lah
tak tahu asian pun boleh suka asian asian girls
that kind of guys will be like oh nanti kita dah kahwin boleh masakkan I lah
masakkan I like some sambal goreng or something like that then I'm like huh
you think I kahwin ni mesti nak masak sambal goreng
kau kelakar ke apa you know
the I'll be like oh ah lah I degree tapi film jer film jer you know that kind of thing
kau thanks man
and then you can tell like the first like five selfies is like me like really want to perasan
kau sial
pukul satu pagi saat dia text dah nak pukul dua
okay so ni lisa ni like how I don't think the the
I I've I seen phone cases where you can um like print macam pictures on the phone case I'm thinking that you are saying like macam a picture sort of thinkers the frame pictures that's what
that's what sarah is saying right and then ah dekat
plaza sing there is um the kedai tingkat dua depan pizza hut where you can make
ya correct kalau macam can
a tote bag with our pictures then they go to like macam supermarket
macam aww I have my tribe with me while I go buy some bawang
photo book you you you are right cause I have friends who give me photo book I look it on memories aww then cry then after that taruk dalam kotak and then like
when you clean up your house baru buka oh ya I remember this rachel give it to me two years ago ah what
I think kita like err we can just do
okay I think got like dua minggu to
the way she's guarded now is like ah whatever ah sembarang ah on ah go jer like she she she ya
eh lighter mana like lighter mana
ya ya ya and then I just she she tried to be the again the the the kakak kakak like trying to make jokes I was just like
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole bali thing with the whole tini and the bali thing and all that cause I I macam
meeting tini was just like a coincidence thing cause she dia dia kerja dekat the hostel kat mana ni clarke quay then I was working kat lima pe
so I I know that tini has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like eh babe come ah lepak ah like
ah apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima like we can just like hang out eh no that time habis kerja siang two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like haji lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in bali when me and azmi left so when me and azmi was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us tak ada apa-apa lah no lah nothing dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like macam orh this jas guy is nice memang he he he is a very lepak guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with tini cause we asked tini face to face so all these while when tini like when we when me and her hung out ah like she like oh dekat bali this happened and then he give me all these
tini macam ah macam oh dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking dia dia lupa pe sial kita like in a group ya correct then um like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just diam I just cause she she
ah she was just basically macam member lah eh jas gini gini gini I don't know I have ah macam you know commitment issues tini like of course lah kan dia dengan dia punya commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know ah this happen and then she's like oh jas told me dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah hey cause dia lupa sia correct then I
when I hear all these things from tini I'm like bullshit bullshit sial lah dia ni puki betul budak
so at some point no we hung out kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga
sabar sabar sabar sabar so
at at some point tini said this sentence um jas cakap dengan aku um macam uh I never felt like this for a girl before dia cakap gitu that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then tini just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan sarah babe
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual lah dia cakap gitu then at at some point I told sarah sarah
cause what me and azmi told her was that actually jas and tini tak ada apa-apa but when we were there memang they really like
they they told me to they told to our face eh tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas
ya jas dengan tini and then when we left back when me and azmi left first then they stay in bali apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her lah
ah so dia masih dia dia fikir dia casanova this guy sana like that so um
she just went her minah lah she did became the minah
err dia salahkan jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so ah ya then then that night happened and
ya then I'm like kau nak pergi berbual dengan sarah buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan jas I say like that dia yang buat problem pe like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to tini which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with err sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and dekat rumah dia dekat yang percil tu ah we we lepak we hung out
ah I am what was the word she used um macam berbual belakang dia ah like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole um
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like aku rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask azmi you can ask nisa or whoever was there at your birthday lah that was your birthday right my intention was really eh sarah this this happened to sarah okay sekarang like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and azmi in confident and I go out macam to her aku
ah macam lan jiao wei pasal dia babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation ah what I macam ah what I ah take from it is that ah sarah and sarah is dia always takut err she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel lah this is just my personal
um macam um how to say eh macam um
no no no like macam dia jaga conduct
like like her way her her image is dia nak kena jaga conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one ah ah I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not nangis to azmi but macam I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told azmi that I I I I know this is my niat but sometimes kadang-kadang niat baik but um you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
from then onwards I I macam I ah back off sort a little bit to really
ya ya correct cause correct tini told me ya sorry tini tini told me that um macam I've I don't open up to guys one like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she senyap this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
um like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the laksa thing we were having I was pissed off lah I feel like macam you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you macam nak buat sial kat kau you know but
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still eh jom ah lepak even though for months you been eh come ah we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
kau cakap dengan aku pasal something I don't go to ni
ah no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my macam um my intentions to ah
we and it for us like sometimes oh we talk about tini macam gini
but gossip is kau tahu dia ni
um in our macam friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me macam
ah hati dia like she wants to jaga her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
eh bilang aku bilang aku you know
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to gaduh ya and any relationship will have that macam you know macam ah ah apa err what what's that word ah friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to gaduh in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where apa aku cakap too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
kan pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas ah nak cakap nak kena
like you lah kita nak main game tak nak main ah jangan banyak cakap
kalau azmi lagi whoa
no I think he's macam sial
why why kenapa like why are you so macam anti natural things
ah macam ginger ke balms
err your mum masak or orh
ah dia orang nak pergi perang nak kena ada aircon juga sia kita singaporeans siol ah count on me singapore
ah then my mum like eh pergi buka tunjuk kat adrian fireworks then I tried to switch on my it wasn't there

melampau sia
oh sini
di tanjong katong
ah macam carousell gitu

sakit babe
sakit gila sia kalau kena bisul
actually it's very funny I was cause last weekend we were talking about kalau kita dah tua like duduk mana like you know and we just lepak somewhere where you know there's the sea or something you know um I was I was it's just funny I was just thinking about this if really like money is
sort of macam not a problem sort of right like I would probably macam ah tanam basil tanam
thyme tanam apa err daun bawang lah apa lah you know shit like that and then I will learn it on youtube cause like hello everything is on youtube so it's everywhere exactly ya there's facebook groups you can just join and like eh apa pasal aku punya aku punya daun ni macam senget tepi or something like that you know like
and then I will just I would probably I I picture myself like okay if let's say kat indonesia ke malaysia right
mmhmm just go to like a local school like you know ah ah ajar english ke
riding things like that macam dah sapu rumah
sapu then like err eh jom ah so time to go teach english or you know
lepak ya ya ya I see myself
ya but also it's difficult to jaga ant
he will just macam the kind of macam romeo
jangan bang jangan jangan bang ow jangan bang
main jer
pangkeng pangkeng balik rumah uncle pangkeng
then macam save duit satu minggu sekolah
save lima dollar lima dollar weekend pangkeng ah
ya it's a term that ah like minah
or you naik rumah uncle ah
rumah uncle apa sia rumah uncle
ah rumah uncle balik rumah uncle rumah uncle
or like another matrep err slang ah aku kicap kau eh gua kicap sama lu
muka kau kasih kicap eh
terus macam kau I remembered the first
time someone used that word kampung
but err we we wrote letters to each other right cause dulu tak ada tak ada social media
you know asal kau berbual dengan dia ni ah
then I'm like ah kita tulis surat ah then after that she's like tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung
gua mahu turun sekarang then
apa sia kampung
then she like kau kampung pun tak tahu sial kau ah kampung dia cakap gitu
terus aku then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my kakak angkat what is kampung so apparently ah kampung is like ah
kau budak mana it's like where are you
ah which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that lah then I was like oh abeh kira kita ni kampung apa aku tanya kakak angkat aku
and then ah she like kita budak marsiling ah cause last time I stay with my with my auntie ah in in woodlands vista point area then budak kita budak marsiling ah
then in my head in this secondary one two tak nak ah marsiling tapi kita tinggal woodland jauh seh dengan marsiling
I jalan and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that kan dia macam you can see from their face macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down tangga saw me
and then dia macam stop in the middle of tangga then I'm like uh turun jer lah kan
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like macam old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing ah ya so like that
ya marsiling punya
marsiling gua kicap sama lu budak toa payoh
that one cina cina one ah I think
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me macam cause
their their eyes is like apa kau buat kat sini so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
this group of boys tak ada judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like macam
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like boleh duduk diam like what sepuluh minit lima belas minit
but after that if they want to go down they want to lepak so they bring this boy to the playground main catching babe
main catching dengan budak-budak kat playground main bola main apa then I'm like
they even suss out um not influencers but artist sort of from other schools macam not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers
and they do hip hop ke beatboxing they gather all these people come to hwa chong and they did a fundraiser all the money that we pay is like five dollars ten dollars goes to real life stories
alahai dah banyak privilege
lagi people sayanglah aku ni yang kat depan ni sial
mm lepas tu aku gi normal sebab aku boleh sports dalam rumah
it's like you would have like I don't know macam kau ada kan
tak ada script and you have obvious obviously you have a script in front of you you know you would have practice it at home
tak ada ke macam someone like err no one plays sports in the house go normal and
ya tak ada ke like just a
ah of of people's voice actually marwah punya ex ex secretary also so like the moment I heard that I told azmi like alright
yes my vote is not a secret undi awak adalah rahsia
time semua orang tak ada kerja lain
ya so he was on my list like eh local uh local account lah like eh this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the dia punya videos was all quite macam angsty ah like
oh you see this vulgar tat tut tat semua basically like macam all the people like being annoying lah time dia tengah nak deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of dia pergi tampines mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and pasal tu time kan so we cannot go out kan and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that
ya serious macam like like some horror story is here
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like malam-malam buta like nine plus I was like eh this guy doing live live what sia
because at that point in time I just thought macam he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like oh wow wow he cause it
yes abang grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that um based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind yang like cause of like his friends dulu kat secondary school semua kan and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like apa ni bro
he actually he has the beng vibes but the most kekek thing is like the way he talks is very macam narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
kelakar lah like
ya it's quite bahan actually
exactly so I think actually by right dia punya target audience is
all following you it's so scary you know oh my god like there was this kid dia macam
I was like I say asal this budak like freaking thirsty you know
macam dia kata come live with me apa apa apa then aku was like
eww then aku press dia punya profile then I was like oh my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya oh it was so scary so and then um so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk kan is macam corporate gila
tu lah pasal dekat dia tanya um in which area do you reside I was like reside eh
first off aku dah block dia I was like saying uh don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because uh and then semalam pun like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like ah eh awkward
technically ah I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation yang pakai kan but it's still very disturbing lah but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like tak layan and then he doesn't assume anything oh ya then he was like how do I address you ah aku was like how do I address you macam then
the next for me macam the automatic response is miss farizan takkan lah kan apa seh macam merepek sia
zan ah actually aku was like alamak aku terlupa nak tukar my um name pasal it's still zan A yang ikut my um and aku was like
alamak too late to change to air lah takpe takpe lah zan lah zan jadi lah
yes oh my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you zan right and I was just like yes senpai noticed me ah terima kasih terima kasih
a'ah I was like opocot aku jadi marauder I there's actually like no real function to it ah cuma macam bragging rights jer
a'ah so I macam ah my dreams
ya I was I was like planning kalau macam ini hari kan kalau aku jumpa dia I will be like grab ge</mandarin
probably dia macam siapa then aku was like confirm tu kena instant block
oh ni dia eh yikes
tampines that's why so dekat
ya actually dekat and I kind of roughly know macam tempat dia lepak
no lah not his but his route yes because like like kat kat tak banyak tempat yang that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs yang dekat the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king dekat the
so I don't know like actually his account macam supposed to be like educational ke apa at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like aku yikes
ya and then there's the mat minah tiktok
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then aku macam what's this eh like
I macam pull apa eh macam pull follow ke apa ke macam but it's like those thirst trap punya videos
ah a'ah kan I tak faham
okay but macam maksud dia tu apa
I I was just thinking of the mat minah call
just macam
macam how did you discover that app do you remember
ya ya because macam at the start that was what it looked like kan it was macam in between musically and vine
macam there's the reputation kan
technically those people must be underage juga
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just macam by proximity like you know the few local
you're talking about macam algorithm dia
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post terus like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I macam okay all right
like then the subsequent macam views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one macam the benda-benda bodoh I don't tag it I just macam
ya so that's the thing right I was like wow I didn't know that tiktok ada live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
ya so it's um it's really interesting it's like you know how um live eh no not live eh live and live ada like the likes kan but it's just macam free kan you press
jadi boleh spam ke apa entah so apa ni like tiktok ada like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
I don't think it's that much lah because like I said macam dia punya follower base is more like budak-budak kecil so macam he will he will say say like oh thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like oh thanks for the rainbow puke and I pun macam he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk sekarang pun like dah lagi mahal bro
so like everyone is always saying stuff like oh come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel lah kan and aku was like what is this thing he's talking about
you see that's why you should donate to me dia cakap kelakar gila dia macam his humour ya
and then like I think I finished my virtual punya class and macam they just started opening that time face to babad like
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I uh I recognize the dance moves kan then I was like hey insyirah like is this afrobeat standard like ya macam how you know and all that then aku aku was telling her lah that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying oh it's that this studio da da da da so uh it took me like damn long like aku just took the information and just like buat bodoh ah until happened
and then phase two then aku was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
a super fast one and aku was like aku nak mati eh
after a long break it's just like rombak rombak and I was like ha
like and then like each five ada like segment ah then you cannot mix
then that one uh because you maintain two meters tak payah pakai mask
ya my lindy punya yang solo pun begitu uh our capacity is about twelve
so sama lah two meters and all that tak payah pakai mask tapi tu recently um because of uh partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then tu kena pakai mask ah pasal like contact
but itu pun they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance sikit jer partner ada ya
dah lama I tak joget penat gila sia I was like ugh
stamina dah turun muscle semua dah macam dah layu
that's the one yang I I started with ya so a lot of my songs are yemi alade songs ya
it's like wah I love him macam the dia punya beat dia punya percussion dia is like is like
it's not as tacky as like macam ada like dia punya ah rentak ah dia like kebak kebak means like cool
and macam I feel like dia orang punya bahasa is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like um the class introduced me to all new like new songs lah as in new and macam different artists ah artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists ke apa besides beyonce
ya oh my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so macam at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
like that's the only thing kita boleh buat like hello excuse me hello police
ya so and macam the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind yang like having fun is more important
macam you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but macam he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
ya but he very cool lah macam even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no no no actually K K jap there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then zul is one of the teachers
then hakim also teaches like um dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall macam a bit macam sexy ah I macam oof
ya then okay it's quite kekek like last two days kan I went for the same studio I tried uh homerun choreo
that one like aku nak mati sia
the person kan like mellow she's a good dancer but dia punya ajar dia macam like from the get go is like super detailed
macam my brain cannot
macam badan angle tangan angle
ah kepala angle I macam ugh
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I macam
yes and loncat-loncat
then macam I felt so demoralized ah like it's so susah and like
so for me the thing is that like kalau stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
I think cause I'm not like a fan kan I just do it cause macam it looked interesting
and then the ones next to her friends semua they were like eh today I become chicken ah I was like that's not wrong macam a lot of them their position I'm just like kenapa ayam kenapa ayam
ya macam cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
sorry ah pekak
mmhmm apa-apa pun pekak
eh lupa ah K jap
no lah okay so ceritanya is apa tau this phone the near RAM only three gig
dia punya internal kalau bukan sixteen thirty two eh
and then eh I try to log in from outram sampai past series belum log in you
disconnect lag crash semua the whole cycle
whoa macam no ya so then I could I could I really cannot you like besides gaming macam
apa eh like it's just super laggy ah macam everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal err internal memory dia dah habis kan
so like literally I was running on entah something macam hundred of free space ke apa entah
exactly so that's why macam dia punya performance pun dah macam tahi ah
huh but anyway dah dua dah dua tahun ah
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for macam work taruh like um prepaid ke apa kat dalam tu
because actually phone ni tak rosak ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
mm it's okay then now I found a new use for it lah because I was thinking eh macam mana kalau I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I akan dengar I just dengar suara dia jer
ya dah suara dia sedap
suara dia macam macam dia punya voice quality is very good
like macam okay K K uh I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M punya guide
macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak ah hmm
but this guy ah macam kau just dengar just like ya macam cool like night setting you know
ya but ini hari I think ini hari dia main muzik so
sekarang you you'll hear him like sing and stuff
macam daripada mana eh tiba-tiba kan
but like why dia need to pakai okay sorry no no no apa dia punya power actually
dia macam apa gravity ke
I was like huh macam-macamnya power dia
kalau kau kalau kau watch three a day
kalau twenty three sikit jer
eh kalau you tengok six a day tau six a day by right empat hari dah habis twenty four
kau rewatch eh
rasa macam escapism which I'm like oh macam I don't like to be too close to reality
it was the most merepek ah okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that bandai has released recently that's not the most merepek
but it's the most macam fantasy lah like super idealistic you know macam the guy must must always get the girl and then ada rival ada love triangle
that's rude ya macam
habis orang mati one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
ya macam oh and then um they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere macam
because at that time kan that uh macam the way you pilot is still macam pakai macam like you driving gitu ah you akan pakai um got the apa macam clutch semua and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart macam the later on the animes kan they they used macam uh like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much lah you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it uh I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves ke apa entah like okay sure like that's fine
like macam if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like macam gitu lah they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like oh macam drop drop from the sky gitu like merepek
ya because it's mm it's a bit dia punya plot
there's then gundam got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the gundam sampai like
and then they continue macam star wars gitu ah so it's like wah the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya but that one was okay but it was macam eh a bit too that one a bit too fantasy ah
ya betul
ya it's always senang kalau nak cakap
because you're not in that situation apa
ya I see that a lot on twitter also macam they will like err retweet those those um am I am I am I an asshole punya post
and then dia orang just like throw the whole man away lah apa you know macam like ya like macam
I guess you can write that way but macam think about how that person is like going through right
ya macam kau they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something aku rasa
then macam huh okay itu jer like ya that's what I was thinking oh actually kalau I wanted to catch up session quite easy
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore punya what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
ya but that's the thing lah macam
but macam it's very like we we call it like what anime typical lah canon typical violence
so macam entah leh
but our censorship selalu macam tu
kau rembat jer
kekek jer sia
ya like ho kita cool
kan kita dah besar
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like and stuff right they will put like macam sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers kat bawah macam
it sound so weird but macam
like in the science textbook they always show you macam
alah benda tu macam benda biasa jer bagi dia
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about macam like
and is it okay but I think it's really like macam commendable lah that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but macam
wait kejap dia interested ke dia macam intrigued
it's just like macam thinking about it
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar
masa tu like my god is sixteen
so it's like so meluat
when I jumpa that my malaysian friend I was like duh
as in I didn't say it macam explicitly but I was like dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa
macam the perangai and cara dia cakap and cara dia like um carry himself is so reminiscent of that I just I was just nice I was like you sound like um I was just trying to be nice
give the full burn satu
mm a'ah yang mana
oh pasal apa eh
oh wow mesti of course and his father is like
oh wow mesti of course
totally wrong ke it's okay it's okay
kat masjid dia orang ah
dia orang ada Q&A session ke apa
wow habis no one was able macam curious cat version
macam he's trying lah
did they show the questions yang she wrote
it's not like macam lame questions kan like those questioning the fundamentals eh
ya lah pasal hari-hari orang just setakat tanya um
ah is smoking haram
macam dah stop it sia like
okay for her everywhere and jalan
okay so orang ni tanya soalan and then they
so dia dia received the question so ustaz tu received the question lepas tu dia dia just simpan dia tak address on the spot
it's true lah I guess it's macam it's getting better these days like definitely but macam
ya ya like kat rumah ya
sekejap eh dia actress dia pakai tudung
macam macam like if it does not add to the plot right kenapa nak bagi sangat orang tu
so kacau macam kau nak tidur lepas tu dengan pin pin dia semua
oh macam uh yang instant ah
I see like unless dia orang nak cakap orang-orang malaysia semua like sleep with tudung like that lah
step like I was going to say step alim but is that rude
bodoh kan
orh macam
macam tak ada ke tak ada ke model lain eh kata shampoo eh
atau macam at least just maybe like say macam the fragrance is nice or something and then like
what mask itu kerja ah
then bila kau nak buat kau nya business sia
then bila kau nak buat you buy the materials and then you never cut
a little similar tak apa lah asalkan it's
okay kita pakai dia orang punya prompt
diam lah betul betul lah

within the snap of my fingers lah with the snap of my fingers petik jari your head

ya all about me lah then jampi what
like I don't bother about or like because I don't know what's the background story of their families lah then why should I waste like my jampi on them
if somebody wants to jampi another marriage or something then just tell lah why do you need to use jampi sia
so that means the hantu is okay with male what
ah okay ah why don't we split the hantu
the family using all of these but to me this is all merepek and like syirik
ya but I I really don't believe until like it it's like closer to me now alamak mama balik pula

why do you think nenek and atuk keep saying that uh mesti bapa kau pakai benda untuk mak kau and everything which I find like macam merepek sia apa sia kau percaya benda merepek ni semua but
and then the wife like macam tunduk dekat dia
and then this pelindung is fighting with etol's thing so that's why I still can think rationally like no I don't want this marriage but that thing also is like playing around and say no you want this marriage
I think kita pergi sudah lah

so dia dia leave lah in the middle of the

I couldn't find out what I was gonna wear lah so aku just end up pakai baju I don't even like follow the dress code aku pakai baju biru seluar hitam dengan slipper semua benda pun tak betul
okay but that time we wear warm tone for our photoshoot what okay kau pakai baju apa ah that time

to be honest annoying gila ah
with who no tapi year one kau kau at first okay to be honest when kau baru masuk kelas tu kan kau nak berbual dengan siapa
ya like baru habis O level N level whatever class
bodoh lah tu girl mm a'ah a'ah but how did you even think of like talking to shaz at first so doesn't matter what you can be different class also what ah ah one G one G one G
so aku nak tanya dengan kau kalau kau ada tiga hajat so what are you going to wish for
you nak jadi billionaire lah okay
so can use your jet lah untuk pergi travel dengan family ni semua lah
duit belanja kau orang cari sendiri ah macam gitu ah
okay for myself lah eh apa yang I wish for is
if like kita nak pergi vacation ke apa ke vacation at least kita boleh
vacation macam near maybe malaysia ke apa ke kan ah boleh pakai kereta kan ah
then uh kalau macam tak pun kita buat plan macam pergi picnic ke apa
so whenever kita ada kita punya own car
ke kita nak beli grocery nak pergi shopping at least we got our own car
since we got a big family right ah okay lah kita ada car so
uh I want to have a baby lah at least kalau ada
stable punya ni
uh at least dah boleh ada anak
pasal ada anak banyak pakai duit nak beli pampers nak beli susu everything kan
ah so aku rasa
lebih baik uh
dah ada stable semua financial baru ada baby ah kalau tak stable nanti anak nak makan apa kan
takkan nak kebulur makan pasir eh ah jadi at least kalau kita dah ada duit ah at least we also
sebelum jadi richest pun kita nak kena pandai save duit
ah save duit you need to have plan about money ha
kalau kau dah plan ah semua jadi at least bila kau ada anak
nak hantar anak kau pergi sekolah sekarang sekolah bukan cheap eh
memang mahal lah mahal gila lah eh
lagi-lagi buku dia orang lagi baju sekolah apa semua ah abeh dia orang punya tambang pergi sekolah apa semua
abeh kau nak kena hantar apa semua unless kau nak belikan basikal ah untuk anak kau kan
basikal so suruh dia orang ajar dia orang macam mana nak kayuh basikal so at least they can
ah semua pasal duit okay lepas tu
lepas tu semua aku dah fikir fikir pasal ada anak semua aku dah fikir pasal future lah
ah then nombor tiga
aku fikir nak bawa family aku pergi holiday
mm pergi luar negeri lah pergi holiday ataupun aku pergi honeymoon sebab aku belum pergi honeymoon lagi kan
since daripada hari aku kahwin tu aku belum pergi honeymoon so that is why I'm thinking lah so at least
um dengan duit yang aku ada tu aku boleh bawa ah family aku pergi travel everything lah
tu yang aku fikir lah mm
so aku rasa yang paling penting sekali is
untuk ugh
rapatkan lagi silaturahim is dengan buat family gathering lah macam tu mm
oh that one I got heard from my mother-in-law yang pasal tu lah
my mother-in-law cakap lah yang dia dengar dekat warta berita kan since I kerja I pun tak ada time nak tengok warta berita kan
ah so bila my mother-in-law kasih tahu I macam
eh serious ah mak serious ah dapat
seratus dollar I thought is
seratus dollar in cash lah I was so happy ah sekali dia kata voucher
sekali you cakap dia orang pakai singpass lagi I cakap a'ah lah pakai singpass pula
ah that's why macam
boleh ke eh ah boleh ke tidak eh
apa yang kita tengok dekat warta berita dia orang kata tunggu lah dia orang announce kan
so kita tengok jer lah dia orang announce boleh pakai kat mana kat mana semua lah ah we just wait lah
so at least after dia orang dah announce kita boleh ni lah boleh discuss
maybe kita boleh buat vacation ke untuk kita punya ni lah
family buat family gathering like what I said lah
family gathering ke apa
kat singapore pun tak [pe] lah kan
since dia kata december baru dia keluarkan so about
then maybe from there we also can uh plan maybe buat january ke february ke
ah so kita boleh bring along our cousin
our cousin punya birthday kan uh january end of january
kita buat ah ni ah birthday party sekali ke apa ah
ah tengok lah kita nak book hotel ke kita nak book chalet ke apa ke
tak kisah lah resort ke whatsoever that we can book lah kan ah
tengok bajet yang kita ada ah with the bajet is it enough ah macam gitu lah kan
ah tengok lah depends
kita tengok lah kalau cukup then maybe kita boleh ni
ah dengan hundred dollar voucher tu maybe kita boleh
book hotel yang yang boleh buat vacation
um macam birthday party tu birthday event lah kita boleh buat event birthday party because
macam cousin kita kan uh birthday dia january then my husband punya is february kan
so uh why not kita buat end of uh january
dengan uh february pasal february first feb kan my husband punya birthday kan
ah so jadi kita dah buat ending january tu dengan first feb
at least dua hari satu ah satu malam
betul tak dua hari satu malam ah so kita boleh book so kita boleh celebrate both uh birthday
dia orang together kan ah so at least ah kita boleh ni ah bincang-bincang nanti plan dengan cousin kita macam mana
whether we want to book a resort ke
kita nak book chalet ke kita nak buat staycation ke ataupun kita nak sewa hotel ke
ataupun we also can plan want to picnic kat marina ke ah so at least
one day ke ataupun kita picnic jer kat situ sampai esok pagi so at least boleh
celebrate dua kat east coast ke west coast ke ah macam gitu lah kita celebrate ah
betul tak mm
overnight pun boleh picnic pun boleh lah kan lagipun kita semua
satu rumah what ah then yang lain dah kahwin yang yang kita nak ajak ni cousin dah kahwin ah so
it's okay since dia boleh bawa husband dia sekali ah
so maybe barang-barang yang kita beli kat daiso tu kita boleh buat sendiri lah tampal sendiri
tapi apa yang aku rasa lagi save is macam hari ni birthday our cousin kan then the next day birthday abang kan
my husband eh jadi you nak err buat macam mana jadi pukul dua belas
uh macam kita buat macam
uh eleven plus gitu nak dekat pukul dua belas so at least kita celebrate
satu kali jalan ah macam gitu kan so it's better right
so at least time kita celebrate okay uh kita dah
tiup tiup tiup oh okay okay lepas tu ah kira macam satu cake
ah then kita celebrate untuk hari ni dengan esok gitu
uh kita picnic kat west coast ke east coast ke
marina ke
err whatsoever lah payung besar sudah
actually right I got saw that time inside a website ah I not sure is it at west coast ke east coast
yang dia orang ada buka macam khemah besar tau
macam khemah kat dalam ada sofa ada macam I think it's sofa ya
dia orang buat uh ni
uh kira macam tempat murah-murah lah kat macam
yang kau boleh ni ah kira boleh chill chill dia orang cakap
sekali aku tengok eh
aku cakap eh not bad siak dalam ada ni eh
ah ni ah dia orang tengok ada table kecil aku tengok abeh lepas tu sofa
ah itu betul-betul khemah khemah macam khemah besar so if raining dia orang cakap kau tak payah risau
but uh morning I want to do some activity you know like rock climbing ke zipline ke if
abang to mm
but tak tahu lah eh tengok macam mana ah
nak buat apa seh
mm confirm like macam dah lah panas terik
ah lepas tu tengok-tengok binatang berpeluh-peluh lagi lepas tu ketiak semua nanti basah aduh
mak kan tengah sakit also right so
maybe dia orang akan bawa lah
takkan tak bawa kan gila tak bawa kan
dia orang pun kan tak boleh tak boleh hidup tanpa anak dia orang kan
confirm kalau shopping kita punya cousin
adik intan mesti memang suka suka gila shopping
especially kalau dia tengah ada duit dia memang suka shopping shopping tak habis-habis shopping baju baju baju
baju ah
so aku rasa
maybe lah kita just go with the yang pergi berkelah tu lah
lagipun kita dah lama seh tak pergi berkelah
a'ah seh picnic picnic picnic tak picnic picnic
but I think your abang
ah confirm dia cakap eh huh kenapa tak cakap siang-siang
ah akan save pe duit
then you can see pantai also ah
ya but I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
you feel like not bad right eh macam eh cantik pe view dia
eh why not I memang nak pergi
but I thought of going with your abang lah that time
kau tengok ah selalu jer kita busy busy busy macam
since dia kerja aku kerja
kan so tak ada time
then balik rumah pun buat kerja rumah
gedebak gedebuk semua ah so tak ada time lah
plan actually aku dengan abang kau macam macam tau plan
even aku
kita plan
nak buat rock climbing sama-sama ah
zipline ah ni semua
that's why I would like to ni lah cari
mana mana ah tempat yang ada kan activity macam gini
so at least kita boleh buat activity ni tak tahu kat mana yang ada activity ni
ah kallang memang ada
I got saw I got saw that time yang masih
aku pergi tengok wayang dengan kak faz kau kat kallang
after kak faz kau balik kerja tu
abeh aku cakap eh tak sangka seh rock climbing dekat dalam building ni then dia cakap
next time kalau bie nak join join ah dia cakap gitu so aku macam
oh serious ah aku pun macam
betul ke boleh join ni huh
dah macam tak ada confidence eh sekarang dah gemuk dulu badan macam mana kan ah
kalau dulu tak gemuk macam gini ah okay lah
aku pun tak tahu lah
hais makan makan makan malam aje makan lapar lapar lapar makan
so that when we lepak
kita boleh ni ah
makan makan makan ah sambil lepak tengok if I not wrong have
but if tak ada
kita still boleh lepak-lepak berbual-berbual sambil makan chips chips dia tak apa ah
kita beli chipsmore ke then kita beli chips ya lah chips biskut kan
ah yang cemil-cemilan ah
but serious ah kalau kita lepak macam gitu still nak buat pit ke
barbecue pit still nak buat barbecue pit
kita masak lah kan masak lepas tu bawa
since kita like what you say nak pergi petang kan ah okay lah
ah tempat sometimes especially weekend
so I think like kita nak kena book
uh ni cepat sikit
if not kita terlambat kita tak dapat lah tempat
maybe some of us ke siapa-siapa kita boleh pergi dulu so at least
tak kisah lah siapa sampai siang kan
kalau sampai siang at least kita ada tempat tau ada tempat
ah kita dah book untuk berapa orang
ah so at least dah ada orang tau
ah dekat tu tempat
jadi tak ada orang boleh ambil ah
ah then you say eh salah salah salah tempat ah macam gitu also cannot what
energetic ah gitu
ya drama melayu sangat aduh
and like what we say kan kita nak standby duit lebih sikit is because balik
kan kita nak grab kan jadi balik confirm penat pe kita dah ada activity kan lepas tu balik penat confirm nak grab kan
so that's why that's why I cakap yang ini I rasa lagi kita boleh save
kita dah kita bawa daripada rumah benda yang boleh pack
semua pack what I think is
better rather than kita bawa satu-satu gitu
then bawa banyak pinggan
it's better that kita bungkus bungkus satu-satu pack
so bila tu kita tinggal pass jer kat semua orang
so dalam everything kita boleh letak but like macam dia punya side
macam hotdog ke macam crabstick ke apa kan
ayam ke apa itu kita boleh letak dalam tupperware lah so
anybody can ni ah cuma mi mi ke nasi
ah tu kita boleh pack dekat bungkus so at least they can
tak lah sometimes people still need nasi what you never know you the kind yang nak nasi
ha you die die nak nasi ah betul tak
tak apa it's okay ya
mi untuk semua then letak nasi dekat dua bungkus sudah
nasi letak dua bungkus tu ah letak penuh-penuh
jadi kita tak payah ni ataupun letak satu tupperware
besar untuk nasi jer because the lauk-pauk is already we put different pe
I masak nasi goreng ah
macam esok kita nak pergi activity tu
ye kita beli everything
so kita potong semua
after kita potong semua simpan dalam ice box kita simpan dalam ice box the next day baru kita goreng and everything so bila kita nak pergi
so kita potong sayur sekali kita potong hotdog kita potong crabstick kita potong
ayam ke apa apa lah
yang kita nak kena potong kan apa yang
apa-apa lah fishball ke apa ah semua lah potong sekali
if rajin ah if rajin really rajin
kita boleh cucuk cucuk ah
cucuk hotdog fishball crabstick macam gitu sedap sikit
ha gitu
kita boleh minta tolong abang ke kak nani obvious ah dia tak akan tolong dia mesti kata nak tidur
oh but abang also nanti dia tired the next day abang kerja
but like what abang see if we really want to have some activity in the morning
ya that's why I cakap letak maybe mi ke
nasi kita letak dekat benda tu that's why I cakap terus nanti boleh buang tak payah ni
kita letak dekat tupperware jadi kalau kita letak dekat tupperware
tak payah ni so kita boleh buang
oh ya ya ya lepas tu kita cover pakai aluminium foil jer aluminium foil is it a'ah
tapi kita nak naik grab tu nak kena pegang juga lah
letak kat belakang ah semua
the whole kau punya ni
ah rides kau pegang jer barang-barang tu
confirm kalau semua goreng confirm kau akan rasa bosan kan
uh something like maybe lemak cili padi ke apa
letak so kita ada kuah dengan ni
tak payah eh
roti sandwich yes
apa yang kita perlu ada since ada event kan sandwich of course kena ada
so um that's why I cakap at least I nak letak satu dish
so bila ada satu dish tu
at least ada lah lauk macam
lauk kau cuma goreng-goreng jer kau akan rasa macam bosan sebab semua goreng
so at least kalau ada lauk sikit because
kau makan apa-apa pun kau mesti nak ada kuah kan
that's why I cakap
so at least I nak buat yang lemak cili padi ke apa ah something like that lah
ya like what I say maybe I nak buat yang tu
lemak cili padi ataupun I nak buat
uh sambal goreng satu sambal goreng satu lemak cili padi
sambal goreng is for mama because mama vegetarian
kita kena fikir nanti mama cakap eh sana ayam
eh sini ayam
ya we also need to remember eh kita kena beli uh vegetable ball
dengan apa tofu mushroom ah
some kind of this kind lah uh yang kita kena beli lah pasal kita bring along mama kan
confirm dia orang akan beli yang dekat belakang ah
dekat belakang rumah dekat pe
from there dia orang akan naik grab pe like what
uh abang seth cakap kan
macam abang kau ah dia pringles pringles tu tetap dia nak
you want to buy mi eh buy pula you want to masak mi hoon ke mi goreng
I think mi hoon goreng is better right because we got a lot right
so you want to cook nasi goreng is it
so you want me to cook the nasi goreng cina
I masak nasi goreng ikan bilis lah ada ikan bilis sedap sikit
ya lah ikan bilis itu lah that is what I mean
nasi goreng ikan bilis pakai ini pe is warna putih what
okay so you help me nanti potong-potong ayam
we potong
ya you potong ayam
so pasal I nak masak lauk pe
abang suruh potong hotdog ah nanti
dua packet cukup tak dua packet tak cukup empat packet
empat packet lah eh empat packet
but one thing I don't like is because I punya cut eh of hotdog eh is different
memang aku punya is like memang
slide slide uh ni apa
slice dia macam diagonal is it
aku tak nak lah macam
kalau yang ni kecil besar kecil besar because
aku punya orang is very particular about dia punya size kalau boleh aku nak buat tapi
sandwich lagi aku tak suka nanti senget macam bersepah
aku especially sandwich ni aku tak suka very particular lah
oh takpe
kita buat macam ni jer apa kata kita buat
so sebelah sapu tuna lah
lagi sebelah kita letak egg lah egg mayo lah
ah jadi bila tu kan dia jadi sedap tau ah I think this already good lah
so jadi dia orang tak ni
jadi dia orang kalau at least dia orang spread
ah tak ada lah ni sangat kan
tak lah pasal apa kalau sayur
ya because they don't really know macam mana nak letak ah
kau pun tahu pe aku kalau buat sandwich aku very particular aku nak make sure sandwich dia nampak cantik
so beli yang ada cili punya
you know itu baru sedap
so the crust apa awak nak buat ke
I think maybe kalau macam gini
since ada sandwich and ada ni then kita nak beli
fishball nak letak ke
since uh mama tak makan
so at least kita boleh buat cheese fries
if not nanti sampai sana semua dah taste not nice ya
kita nak beli mat yang dua dollar tu
tu lah aku pun fikir-fikir juga
because when we plan like what abang say when we plan every time
mesti tak jadi seh everything tak jadi tak jadi huh
I think why not we just buy a dress for kak nadiah
then for abang uh kita beli kasut jer
at least baju kan
she really need baju
since dia tak habis-habis cakap kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kan ah
denim means kita lump sum pe sebab
kita sharing what duit share right so beli satu it's considered cheap what
kita beli kat uniqlo
but since kita nak pergi tu kita kena
bawa baju extra lah
so balik time baju colour ni eh
pergi baju colour ni ah betul tak
maybe first day navy blue ke because everybody can have blue colour since kak nadiah kau pun suka blue colour
aini kau suka blue colour
abang kau pun ada blue colour aku rasa ah so
kita boleh go with the blue colour lah navy blue then the second day
mm balik time maybe
oh dah macam time aku nikah green and blue
I got my jubah
pink also can I got no issue about pink colour I think abang also got no issue
but nanti dia kena pakai smart smart nanti dia cakap
apa ni nak pergi picnic kena pakai smart smart because the pink colour is dia punya smart casual
one ya kena gosok
but that one become smart casual ah ya abeh nanti macam tak gosok gitu eh
tak boleh lah
forbidden a'ah forbidden jadi obedient
kelakar seh
is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
ya so I work from home for macam
then I feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why I rather work kat
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
that's why I tadi I ask you to take a picture of your your working setting
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah I will just like duduk depan depan then my laptop
oh make the home macam office like that ah
oh then what your wifi around your houses eh around your houses around the house macam good ah
ya lah then how you do your work seh macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai pakai pakai apa Microsoft or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out meh macam never lag or what
ya so now buat apa
oh you've been working part time kerja apa eh cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
but you are still working what okay lah tu means you dah survive sikit
kerja apa why you never explain
oh pack apa
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga kan
kerja kat mana kat warehouse eh
uh at ibu cik house lah the difference right
one week and then you cannot tahan
it's just too fast paced ah macam mm
ya one day berapa
if you are at the first first person ah then paling senang
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy ah
macam from
pack for eh no we start at about oh macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
uh scoop the kuah then after that you kiap the container then you
ah pack kat kitchen ah so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas lah then when you kiap the container then you also will kiap your finger lah
bla bla lah then lepas balik
I mean the the packing place yang I kerja is um
express gila lah especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat seh
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa seh kerja malam
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
ya so kerja apa
then kenapa you leave
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy one
okay then kerja ini kat mana
oh dekat lah
pukul sembilan eight thirty
you've been closer right every time sekarang I always saw you and
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when I see your InstaStory macam eh
apasal seh
oh gitu eh macam mata merah ah kirakan
like jealous ke like oh I have a boyfriend but you don't like err
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy faham lah that's the thing
meet tapi masih berbual kan
like on Whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
bagus ah
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
together and individually so macam okay ah let's say ah so ah cause sekarang dia dah right
oh that recent stories dia tak appear lah that kind of thing okay okay
cause ah dia sekarang work as financial adviser
uh you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat ah itu jer
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
mm so that is his career so his career now kan dia ah dia
uh gender and everything else so macam
kita is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
ya ya so ah so macam macam mana eh
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his pun pernah happen I don't know eh
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
so uh basically dia dia bilang me Hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu I thought
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling err bad
his dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
wow macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay lah sakit hati tu sakit hati lah tapi at least
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
ya but that someone that lady dia macam
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my no ah like
memang dia they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
like made a move lah macam message lah message the perempuan nak nak know better
kelakar kan
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good lah macam macam he he he he tell me things like err I want to explore he don't want to feel
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
betul lah ya lah professional that part it is lah but at the same time dia nak
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing tu juga I said macam I I say to him ah I also can say the same thing to you what but I choose to focus what is in front of me
from the start of the relationship I got even I pernah bilang you what bila kita nak
boleh lah I mean you nak comment pun comment lah because honestly
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so macam
macam okay
macam dependent lah
bukan macam okay so
ya ah so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
it's stupid lah tapi macam
ya lah faham lah
dia belum kan
ya lah faham lah but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
get it macam
for me now with Han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
I don't know lah I really don't know I don't know whether kita are compatible or what already lah because dia memang dah ada other mindset juga
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no lah because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of Hans
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu but the uh
it has been weeks already ah so if I cry now also macam
it's just tears eh macam really legit sia so macam ya lah
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand lah
tak apa uh it's okay not to make assumption ah but
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree ah dia cakap
uh hmm no he I don't know dia cakap um why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just um be friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu mm
I mm only just now I met him lah after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then I asked ada siapa kalau ada Hans I say to them I tak nak join
mm tapi ya ini susah ah susah
she she sense it lah so macam mm
the group of friends yang I bilang pun macam
so this issue macam I really tak nak bilang orang but
ya tak lah I think pasal I'm just too macam
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
ya ah so ya dah itu jer lah
kadang kadang seh dalam kerja so macam if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out ah
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me kan ah what time you sleep and stuff right
twelve tahu
sometimes I habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu I'll just hang out talk I just like err but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so macam
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I baru balik that kind of thing then once I go home
then it affected my work in terms of productivity lah I lupa benda I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
ah your rumah macam tukar hari hari seh
then before raya I think I went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
it's only your room tak involved lah
but the thing is I don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya mm me me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
because this wifi sucks you okay for example ah kalau sekarang you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
I always do outside kalau tak I'll just do at other places
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
mm patutlah boleh lah gitu ya then I need to pasang one more loh
tak ada lah but
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy kan no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
like on the same track check in apa task you buat ah
macam gitu lah penat seh so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
macam gitu lah ya ya ya correct correct ya
err at pukul sepuluh no worry lah can can
err macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless ah I don't know lah apa lah
merepek gila ah because I mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
oh so you your pay macam mana bila internship
wow ya it's just it's just poly things poly memang
is it tak tahu lah sekali five hundred juga eh
ah then go ahead bro ambil jer
ya then after that you can decide bila you nak continue degree or
you're you're the type yang boleh belajar what I'm not so
no need lah ah now I'm like thinking nak ambil ke tak ah tapi tak apa lah no need ah
ya I'm thinking of that lah but tengok ah
okay so is actually um in which year eh you nak get married eh
err you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a bilik or a room yang like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with lah correct or no
ya lah correct lah tapi sekarang I think you you both have to think what's the budget lah so budget actually berapa is it a combined wedding ke</malay
mm okay okay lah then I think kita we have to take a look part by part lah kan like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and um so basically is between like err in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need kan macam lik
which one you want to cut down ah on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say uh if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat lah because apparently like macam flat kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat chey sepanjang hayat ah
like I say uh the the most important thing is the the the nikah itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
um family support have to come in so that's why that day you all kena macam plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture lah that one have to be very like um
um very like uh transparent but in the event if let's say both side macam let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you ada your own plan of your uh I mean his side ada dia punya own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to fikir or think about i
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb tak so that is another another way lah kan macam kita nak um try to put everything in hand lah
so wedding time at least your side macam okay then for your side uh you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget eh sometimes kita kena fikir that in terms o
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in kita punya err orang melayu kita macam sensitive ah about duit ni so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families belum sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about duit pun kita adik-beradik masih sensitive tak boleh macam eh just bang aku mau pinjam duit kau lah satu ribu macam suka suka jer nak minta kan abang you know I have to be like more tactful to u
kak are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case lagi the other party yang your parents belum kenal kan and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you dah sample among all again okay lah kita work combine then okay celebrate buat combine tapi if let's say oh
ah you know lah I still want my one thousand guest let's say hairin punya side the
your mother say okay tak apa lah based on your budget kita invite saudara mara dekat jer one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
because there are two factors you need to think first um kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak because you all just become a new family member secon
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup lah tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh then after this the next time dia pergi rumah</malay
like macam err
tak tahu lah macam waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get err
and then july got a flat ah my kita punya timeline two years tu nak engage</malay
you know then tak tahu macam mana tahu bought flat then because ah because atuk said better
cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri then after that we are like ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle semua macam dah haywire all I received only fla
kita punya like dream wedding kita punya dream vacation semua macam dah flash toilet jer tu begitu ah so it's lik
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like macam ah my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
um makanan tapi kan shamefully I have to admit even I dah work that time kan I tak boleh afford tau because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like macam even like you know the bridal like you all have all these ah then I think I can only afford the photos begitu that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even hantaran nak exchange ah
um I think quite I I would say I like macam drag it lah but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of hantaran I think in the en
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay lah why not kita combine kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk exchange hantaran</malay
uh the equipment that include all the err the kompang and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so kita kena tengok macam mana lah kan so is lik
orang melayu kita ni actually err come with a lot of err gotong royong even though kita tak sekampung lah not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like macam pinjamkan kereta you know so when if you no
err how to say farah see you just like okay lah whatever people uh rent you okay lah something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like macam</malay
uh certain relative got this car whatever they say eh I chope your car dulu for the coming wedding can or not just ask lah
you know or maybe like dekat dekat wedding tu you ask becaus
uh dulu I in this case usually lah people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
uh we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar lah pe seh joke ah I'm not racist tau but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing lah so it was just like kita like just focu
ataupun early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out agak agak because by that time you dah start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly berapa one month berapa dapat sav
so basically you can agak agak already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one ah
this one take time lah but again uh I think hairin uh or or hairin lah siapa lah uh maybe is t
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because uh you ini kan actually masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so memang lah nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa lah kan yang mereka seems like okay okay tapi tak okay kot</malay
ya memang lah um to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like macam secara positive ya so at least that macam you know what you can um do best within this err
uh constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it lah so let's talk about happy things lah macam stress jer cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita happy pulak dalam pasal pasal wedding ni</malay
so kirakan okay actually that time you got share with me kan tentang mak andam like quality of mak andam</malay
ya okay macam itu kira not too bad lah kan because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like macam prepare and then both both parents are okay ah it's just anyway you also have time also nak save money you kno
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because um certain country dah already open kan so macam you can just like chill relax lah macam</malay
tak payah lah macam nak fikir fikir sangat kan then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house ah that's another advantage lah
ah ini pun if let's say both side okay lah I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like kita macam like okay jer like nikah is that correc
oh I think that part can't be helped right we all memang lah keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam happy happ
know you are like can can just like uh kita sama sama you know ramai ramai meraikan chey macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada lah saja mengeratkan silaturahim so I think can lah I think we jus
ah but now I think for now don't take it as uh macam sedih nak kahwin kan you just more like if all the all the err apa ni restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both kena bincang</malay
sebaiknya like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month macam kena ada like your own goals lah but if let's say if both of you like very nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want nak buat kan like macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap kan biarlah you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
um to prioritise lah then kalau let's say family kata oh no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit lah ah okay option one I let go the fla
ah that's another option lah that means to get a resale flat maybe dalam three five years that macam ah you know our relativ
some of them ada so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like uh just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
you know ah sendiri sendiri yang macam nak spend lah so if let's say if this side kata okay boleh ah can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
ah then okay then so semua boleh centralised atau pun nak separate itu another one lah ah because I thin
about tunang he can never be meet everywhere lah kan like macam semua happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation kalau let's say macam boleh</malay
then okay loh kalau tak boleh oh too bad lah because um either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
for you to uh come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor lah okay then if there's an option two that both parties cakap okay lah why not we bought uh you know yang</malay
norms lah sederhana jer like very minimal number of um err what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it lah finish okay dah tak ada lagi lah that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like macam tahu okay kita ada this amount kita ada ni kita boleh prepare macam ini ah then ah
orang ah orang mampu macam ini jer lah kan like it's like you know we can't be bo chap in everything sebab we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that err you apa ni</malay
err for you both all you want is just nikah maybe take beautiful pictures go err nice honeymoon then dah habis then after that focus kat rumah</malay
oh okay okay mas kahwin is err more important than hantaran hantaran is culture mas kahwin is agama</malay
ah so mas kahwin is part of the err macam dalam dalam term dia dalam arab is called maha</malay
so maha is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount yang kita dapat tu minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken yang kasi the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
ah you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which negeri ya dia orang lagi emphasise mas kahwin then a gift gift tu hantaran lah bagi dia orang ah that is culture melayu kita ni terbalik ah
macam ah gift tu lebih high daripada mas kahwin but right it should be another way but I think err mas kahwin ke</malay
err hantaran err for me lah I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents cakap tak nak ambil kan tapi the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way err sometimes rilek jer lah
err you can have the best of both worlds kan jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi important lah kan ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already dah pening kepala lah kan like very um you know so you you just got to doa for awhile rilek you know don't need to thin
err so in detail yet but at least to think okay now macam okay ah you know what is among all these things yang macam</malay
like you can because you think things that you can control macam budget photographer your brother ah these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of hantaran also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that ah if let's say for example ah we exchange err three saja lah item let's say for exampl
okay ah for example a'ah cuma satu I this one I don't know eh dulu I should have known luckily I never ah exchanged quran do you know that what is i
like uh okay so jada is common tapi seh jada kita tahu you will be used for um after marriage in when we play together but when talking about quran and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you hantar al quran</malay
you mean the hantaran</malay
oh duit that one that one is the mas eh ini not mas kan that one is err alah hantaran lah ya lah but some give cheque ah nowaday
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it lah ya if you ask me can be cheque kosong ha ha ha ha
cheque kosong what but inside is PayNow leh is direct transfe
ah so is all depends lah but again if follow tradition ya lah they want to see for real to sure masih cash you know you know bank not
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but mesti there's a transaction and PayNow
mm it happens ah actually happens during my time also is like oh because they only said lah when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so ah ya lah macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot tapi to know each other's partner is very very important so i
so I think like this uh family support is one factor very very important to me lah that's why err I mean culturally kita melayu is very united satu hati lah kan macam like kita you know lah we are lik
we always like um always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples susah even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also lah but the thing is like people also like sibuk and go and go and comment y
oh it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that tapi out there maybe dia pakai card card card tapi tak shar
per per per person or individual like that like macam tak tunjuk lah kan macam</malay
err like no communication with their families feel like tak tunjuk or what lah ya so that can happen tau macam</malay
tak tak tak ada then why you ask me after seven years dating pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke kan maybe all the while the guy only show up front oh aku ada hadiahkan best best you kno
ah dia bukan pun tak tunjuk kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging eh macam berlakon staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating ah but some people ya carry on maybe like for example dia partner no ah
the other party tu tak ada duit maybe tak you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe lah should be okay lah nanti kahwin pun okay lah macam sekarang</malay
um he has so many money aku minta pun okay jer ah you know sounds like but I the end when the person say oh uh he's in debt for the wedding ini ya actually that is not the only on
I think dari zaman our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P ramlee sho
ah lie lah borrow the chetty lah you know that that particular chetty will always just borrow lend the money to them what um high interest and then end up hutang because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family lah kalau family understand family tahu what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them wah very have good job then they get flat dengan with their pa
so there's uh about three months is like or four months ya tak start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
that's why he told me lah kan so like macam very kelakar then I was like abby you all gaji seventy eight thousand dah
then like let me oh mampus ah like that like that then he said no lah it's just tha
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like uh like macam peribahasa melayu apa the apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
ah tak tahu lah don't know lah there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that lah which I always think oh
to know you usually parents ah whether to let go kids to kahwin I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich lah right no need to be like so kaya or whatever you just need to have like um
ah more than enough like can start lah macam you can pay your bills you know you can you can uh you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
err want to want to buy a normal sayur or kangkung</malay
um when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my anak when all of you come to me my anak anak saudara ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision apakah your punya vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you nak make sure tha
you start something that with no hutang you know because basically you you start something with hutang you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know hutang lah kan you will have you got kids already hutang will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing lah ah because memang ah kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang ah kalau kita anak anak sultan johor ke daughters sultan daughters of sultan johor can lah
but the thing don't let it kill you lah that's why I said err in this case kan suka ke tidak instrinsic back breakdown tu kena ada</malay
ah introduce you must have really must have because if not lah if you ask me lah wah very jialat lah like every everything also must risau bu
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean kita tak boleh convince like that macam like for example ah you kno
fathers oh mesti nak ada lima ratus okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents ah okay lah boleh lah boleh lah sembarang ah he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point apa-apa suka hati okay lah korang dah plan kan okay okay tak apa</malay
ah engkau continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin
then after a while kan dia err
it got to a point that dia macam super nonsense
no but I um the the the first wife I don't know ah like apa motive dia buat macam gitu semua kan
dia nak apa revenge
so dia don't love the husband anymore
so dia just nak revenge only
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether dia fall in love with the colleague or
habis um so the guy love her or don't love her the guy like her or don't like her
then why the guy still jumpa with the shermaine and all
dia kan jumpa with the
the han so hee punya bapa
they meet and then after that err macam they the the guy the new guy share information with
ni wife punya bapa
the show is good you know the first few episodes was so good you know that I really want to watch I really want to keep watching and watching kan tapi after awhile
no it's not about the episodes it's about the way they run the show like the was so good ya the story line was so good tapi after awhile it's just so merepek
we watched that so many times and I still cry tu so sekarang I'm watching cerita reply nineteen ninety eight have you watched that
um ah there's dia ada reply nineteen ninety four reply nineteen ninety seven and reply nineteen ninety eh nineteen eighty eight
but no doubt ah princess hours macam is the best ever
ya I watched that bila I'm sec two when I was sec two sec one sec two
you no you why you don't let him ah apa
uh it's not a severe case sorry cause yours only is on here only kat sini macam still have nothing
mm you can go there lah because my sister-in-law kamifie kan dia dulu ada ah macam like yours ah acne like that kan
but at the cheek you know like cheek only I I don't know I forgot but you know the macam termasuk termasuk punya
I think so but it's termasuk you know after after it cured right it
ya like termasuk sikit jer then dekat atas nothing you know nose nothing just the cheek you know
so she went to some aesthetic clinic and then err she paid like few thousand she keep macam dia orang keep inject here inject there but
so after that she said macam okay ah let's do it lah just go national skin centre and then within three months kan the skin really clear up you know
but the first two weeks kan dia punya skin really flared up macam teruk gila macam I think the medicine they use
release all for the first two weeks kan macam teruk gila you know she looks so swollen but
no I don't know but you know kalau if I have that problem right I can actually help you because I can
tapi I have there tengok ni macam
I think I want to buy Cetaphil and I want to buy apa um yang scrub scrub juga tu
I think my skin cannot kena Cosrx eh
tapi Cosrx I need to use for a few days baru that pimple will just go away
oh ya cystic habis that one see
before my marriage kan my face quite kotor also
no no no no the people say people say after beranak then like after you give birth
the darah
or you wash blood or you bekam bekam right
but you know what when I had the cystic acne kan dulu
before kahwin kan
no even if I don't use makeup I will cover it until dia jatuh
if not I use plaster on my face if no plaster pun I just go I don't care
oh they say kan they say it's not because of apa
it's not pasal
yang pakai makeup it's about
you you use it sampai habis eh
no because kan sebab I don't like to I didn't like using that because it's thick I mean macam
I used the balm I feel like macam err I think I felt that
because kan bila tengah kerja that time when before this COVID when I was at work kan when I go to work
I used makeup then balik I have to use makeup remover remover kan so my
skin eh so I find that it's super flawless cuma
your skin is lagi teruk
so kau tak pakai makeup it's tak rabak
I think dekat atas pun dah mati tau
cuma left this one and that one only
no you know I ah I use plaster yang dia punya the transparent one the transparent area
no because the bandage area kan is for yang besar punya pimple that if I can cover that tapi kalau yang kecil punya kan if I cut small then they cannot stick what
I use I do a lot of things back then macam one of those
plaster kan macam gini kan then in the middle is the white colour kan I will cut like macam
four become kecil and then the part then the putih there on the side itu then I will cut like four
strips also then I will just tutup

of the people in the past something like that macam gitu err jadi
tak tau lah
dah habis film sekarang ah
sekarang tinggal production lambat saje keluar pasal
dia dia orang tengah kira-kira pros and cons of

mm video on demand ke apa
lagi apa ya lah Netflix ke apa all those kan
games movies ada you bayar untuk
something like dia orang ada
they don't have the new movies belum lagi berani lah go into this
but you those not produce by Netflix is those produced by Warner Brothers the they dia orang masih belum berani untuk
macam tu kalau this one keluar movies
orang orang bayar untuk subscribe to Netflix to watch their movie
dia punya tu advertisements semua
kalau dia orang buat letak kat tu people will unknowingly buy it mah
nak beli juga I

bukan tu jer yang dia orang look for they look for streams they look for
err people new subscribers masuk people who
upgrade akaun dia orang
boleh tengok to
three people or five people family punya account ah that's how they make the money
and also from the advertisement lah because for every movie mesti ada the sponsors siapa masuk
nak macam let's say Nike wants to be in in
ya lah macam gitu dia orang buat duit
dia promise

for like maybe dia nak tunjuk satu kopi
where your coffee maker say for every minute that you show me I will they will bayar a certain amount

alam nyata ah

ya lah memang betul lah
cakap eh
ya lah tu pasal tu pasal in real life tu tak ada pun
ada lah ada ada
ada ada ada ada there are people like this in real life
tak there are people you know this this is a real question there are people with superpowers in real life
and rasul
and para wali
even wali normal apa normal
pun ada power juga
ya consists superheroes apa
dah habis out of stock so sad
wallet yang tu lah yang the sometimes by designer tu I wanted the the the apa tu oh gosh oh dusty pink I swear I tell abang syafiq to buy fast
tengok oh but this one bulky
the one that I want is very apa tu very tipis dia boleh macam is literally wallet tau and then when you put the phone behind dia tak nampak bulky but cannot use with err cover I think
not phone casing bag lah it's a it's a wallet bag dia ada put phone belakang and it has chain chain strap
tapi tu bulky seh
I can't find any know macam like boring dia punya stroller semua macam like not the one that I want and they mostly is pre-order so that day I want to buy on the spot
abeh takleh ah abeh apa
ya so you open is really very nice actually I like the stroller then me and my friend kan keep on cari-cari like which one we want then finally we found this one is very nice but it's super expensive lah but it's okay lah one time beli
dia tak lightweight it's very berat it's like eleven
abeh lepas tu err I like thinking lah whether to get or not because at first
cause at first macam there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that one like besar gila and then but that one can put two people in two babies two babies
your head lah how can you sit ya you see you see tengok tengok show me ya that one that one the the tu a'ah cantik kan that's why you you see the video it's
cantik kan ah actually dia ada another one it's called Nuna Mixx ini Nuna Mixx next yang Nuna Mixx tu dia fold sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh shorten so dia macam dia compact err so yang ni yang baru ni dia compact and very
apa tu dia fold just nice ah and it can stand on its own and then dia boleh recline sampai ah lay very flat untuk baby baring ya and then dia punya
dia punya canopy boleh tarik sampai kat bawah the canopy the tu the cover ye lah bila dia tidur then like sunlight right either that or you ah you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
like no you use up to six months after that lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi
it's meant for something like that lah macam is heavy or probably the height or weight is not ah suitable untuk dorang anymore
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that macam kalau I want to take grab ke apa ke
because only grab can use uh if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat kalau you take taxi tak payah car seat
cik usop kan kawan abah cik usop ah what oh my god my toe sakit gila skit gila
tapi why seh why is it even swollen eh
no lah I scared lah cause that time I also sakit kaki again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the dia nya tu
how it works ya you will see how how dia punya tu works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the belakang the belakang is meshed is like macam like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part lepas tu when she baring kan belakang dia dia boleh rasa ah panas eh apa the air and then this one also boleh buat like bassinet bassinet
because bawah dia punya feet area kan you can just snap out dia punya feet area tu then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that lah
abeh lepas tu I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar sebab dia colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because dia boleh pusing and baby can face me instead
ya and then like let's say lah macam err apa I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down dia tepi dia ada net ada meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the barang to sampai next week I think about seven days
what baju mm mm
oh this is the baju you say you wanted to pakai eh wanted to buy and then scared dia tak sampai on time
hais so many things oh I want to give away a lot of bags away those tu semua kat dalam box tu I don't know nak tengok ah bag aku yang nak giveaway how to do work like this haiyo
a'ah seh dia dah half lah
and then washing machine pun belum habis the washing machine haven't finish ah so many things to do need dia ada dryer kat dalam dia but ya dryer dia is not is not ah drying lah tapi nak kena like ya it's damp so you you still have to like you still have to sangkut sidai outside
outside ah but it's now raining so I think I'm just gonna put it here then maybe kalau balik rumah jurong I will just bring bring along kalau macam I stay lama ah
ah ya tapi eh tapi ni tak boleh masuk banyak kalau dia nak kalau dia nak basuh like like everyday dia basuh like dua tiga kalau jeans jeans susah ah
tapi laundry mat it's okay lah just get laundry mat lah better what can wash all satu kali ni wash dua tiga kali nak kena wash seh as in cause banyak kan so kalau baju baby okay ah baju baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything masuk dalam tapi bila drying dia kan it's sikit sebab dia punya drying is dalam basket kecil tu you have to keep inside that basket kecil then kalau letak banyak-banyak it won't kering
I mean it's good cause kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan ya socks underwears all the small small ah ni lah T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see ah if he even if he wash this one right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to cuci to dry satu kali and is more saving lah dari dia pergi pergi bawah then washing machine and then after that you know oh no cuci is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash kat sini kat dalam washing machine ni
uniform tak boleh masuk ni busy uniform masuk dalam ni ada ah just have to search ada ada but masalahnya dia nak angkat benda tu ah pergi toilet everytime
orh okay lah ya he can there's there's a slightly bigger one like like maybe double the size of that ya tengok ah dekat lazada ke shopee ke ah no lah ezbuy don't want ezbuy lambat sampai tak habis-habis seh
I mean shopee sells everything oh you know semalam kelakar abang boy called me
he said that his shopee nya barang delivered tapi tak sampai cause he find cannot find the barang so so I said to him lah you contact the seller lah and say mm that the barang tak sampai then after that ah then I fikir balik confirm he he don't know how to do all these lah kan maksudnya never mind lah you give me what's the items yang missing and then your home address ah
lepas tu he he already give me everything then after that he call me again he say takpe zurah dah dah jumpa mak buang kat dalam storeroom because because mak thought it's sampah because it comes in a plastic yang macam ya so mak thought it's sampah nasib baik mak belum buang he just dump she just dump it inside the storeroom abeh the funny thing is arrisa tak
cakap dengan mak is is barang ni tau don't know ah maybe ah cause mak ambil buat masuk agaknya then arrisa also
it's either that or it's either that or the dia macam ah saw it saw it somewhere lah
it's funny then after that I arrisa also laugh I heard over the phone lah kelakar gila mmhmm then mak ingat sampah
nasib baik tak terbuang baju baby seh I think she bought baju baby
I told her go shopee buy all the stuff don't buy me then actually on that day yang datang sana I wanted to show her macam mana nak pakai so busy and all that nasib baik ibu dah tunjuk dia
then abang boy macam like ah pening kepala cause she will start buying stuff I say it's okay lah it's still cheap seh rather than you want to go kiddy palace so expensive
I don't know mana tahu
then you think my back not sakit meh sit like this no because my kaki is sakit that's why macam duduk gini I think I'm gonna feel the same thing like that time apa the my left my left thigh sakit so I need to
because dia macam tangkap belakang I don't know ah but it's so sakit like and now it's not so bad yang that time nya really very bad it's so painful
ya let's hope I put cream esok malam ni nak nak urut lagi
tu ah
now she take lesser naps tau macam she can stay awake for longer time cause she's like almost two months already I can chill I can chill
mm the other night I didn't I didn't I I lambat change her ni kan change her diaper wah she melalak like kena pukul seh she rimas
aura after this we mandi okay after this can go mandi lah can go mandi lah correct
but it's funny because I I do your right side more than your left side you know cause I cause tadi I put like that right then you see so fast ya then this side yang tak then this side I've been doing like I'm very careful
she wants to stay awake dah nak tertidur dah
eh sakit seh I think really ah my leg no no no my toe my toe my toe not my leg
cause the other side also hari tu sakit tapi orh this one more painful
that time sakit dua-dua tapi this one the left side is more painful
then I was like ni siapa seh at first I saw the name lah but the name kan bukan aiman dia letak dia letak is it aiman instagram

mata dia gini jap lagi nak mandi dah tidur lah pula
aiyo nanti she cannot fit some of her pampers dah tak boleh fit dah masuk S oh ya I don't know whether you know kasi baby punya susu macam mana like how the increase right but I read at the tin kan eight weeks to twelve weeks sekarang kena kasi hundred fifty seh
then I like hundred fifty hundred fifty is this full you know satu is it okay
then I like see because macam macam dia still small seh abeh lepas tu kasi hundred fifty I feel like macam
tummy dia not that big what that time kasi ninety dah muntah-muntah aku kalau kasi semalam macam buat hundred twenty she never even finish she drink like fifty jer
that's why I say hundred fifty is the current it's the now right now nak kena buat hundred fifty then hundred twenty pun dia tak tak minum habis macam mana
first month pun kita kasi ninety jer tak kasi hundred twenty ya that one I know dia boleh reach that kind until that amount
ya because I'm worried that it's too much for her but then when I read the ikut the tin punya instructions eh because ah this week eh next week wait ah two more days she'll be eight weeks already so eight to twelve weeks is hundred fifty then I like shock seh macam huh why skip hundred twenty then suddenly hundred fifty apa seh
hundred twenty ah so now cause last time when she drink dia tak tak minum banyak kan macam dia tak habis ninety right I will start doing sixty so now if dia tak habis hundred twenty I will do ninety cause she has to increase apa she cannot stay sixty ninety she needs to go up to ninety hundred twenty okay we gonna drink like that untuk you okay
I'm going to make like that if not you tak habis susu wasted wasted wasted

poly kan macam also is like poly so like I feel like macam ni poly example I take it as eh having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
it's not like macam easy you know like for those people who really like um
buat the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
salute those people who macam have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to um poly ya
phase is just um submitting your diploma ranking course lah kalau your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah kan dia dapat interview so dia pass interview and then she already get her what ah her results that like she can go in like like her place for
um pharmaceutical science memang sudah chop chop for her so macam okay lah she sudah selamat she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because dia memang can already it's like
so macam kalau interview sudah pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all lah
but for me because my interview tak dapat
now focus solely on which is uh kita orang pasal kita orang tak ada exam also so they look
over um they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day macam for us kan ada orang like
um sekolah dia orang satu hari is like is combination of subjects but for me is like kalau math is
then after that kalau there's a mixture of A and B is banyak and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like um three to four
gitu then kalau macam C banyak gitu then maybe around two point five to three point five gitu then um
like baru berapa compared to my other two friend I think they did more better lah in a sense
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech memang nak try dapat biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan dia like
dia like mati-mati nak biomedical science jer like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
but the thing he tak put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense lah cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
biology also tak pernah dapat A
A susah nak dapat then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard lah cause it's the um they focus um on biology the most
so like this semester tak ada exam so I next semester ada exam
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay pasal assignment dia pun is
tak banyak like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day kan like through read virtually like other then after that um
habis ada quiz juga that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
then the practice question is like biasa macam homework gitu
mostly banyak presentation but it's good lah
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm um when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages pasal like I think you will feel like
kalau I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu kan is just like my weakness like
then pasal presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then macam
senang lah but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates yang
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation punya tu
sometimes I'm like wow kita dah eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near um uniforms so macam eh how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old lah then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage kan aku macam actually it's normal macam biasa like wow it's just normal lah honestly
and it's okay cause macam tak ada boyfriend kan it's okay lah macam we don't really take that into my mind macam oh like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like keluar dates with you know I think
I don't really mind lah kalau I have a boyfriend or not as long as macam that is like um kawan dekat you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me pasal later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
NAFA is like lah kirakan
like different people also like different lah honestly like um the things that they're prioritising and it's all like semua ada masing-masing lah hanya
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to macam have a lot of worries like oh pasal duit and all that of course you want your family to be macam stable lah like in every um ya in everything you know
it's very hard lah like I feel like kalau family tak cannot like tak tak ada like stability and all that kan I feel like ah one day confirm will fall apart punya
and some more I also like the type of person yang tak message orang
like wow kalau dah malas dia punya malas is malas tak aku boleh like
for one week straight tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa cause like I'm that type of person ah
so macam ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up kan macam wah like heartbreak this heartbreak gila babi you know like that kind
but then like wah like sekarang I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
but even though like there are times macam eh macam nak ada orang like to be by your side like a boyfriend lah okay kirakan like cakap good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
kita boleh get over it lah there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
so like sometimes kalau oh ada family gathering kan it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something ah even my sister like
like uh video call her friends during ah apa ni I'm having a dinner so I I feel like macam like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay lah kalau ada kawan tu okay but then like kalau it's time to like for your family you focus on your family jer tak mahu get mixed lah like video call with friends like
other time you can do what like kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang like jumpa kawan habis kat rumah also like kawan then like when are you going to like you know um
mm spend time with your family not really ya tak ada
wow I'm lucky to be in such a family kind punya vibes cause different family different ah ada family like focus um
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future kalau nak ada family I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then kalau like my anak-anak macam ada boyfriend ke girlfriend ke aku macam nak bagi advice sikit
the other day was just the other day was first time first time aku turun rumah dia then after that aku try kan ah baju dia I mean dia tak pernah nampak cause COVID pe
she was satisfied with it lah which I'm I'm relief lah cause I scared macam
for baju nikah right
apa tu what is what did they call that ah
takde glow that's what I meant takde glow
baju dia right is baju lama

that baju already on the rack since
material the bajunya material is bridal setting right

macam paiseh sia tak ah like you are checking in people be like then after that aku sendiri badan bukannya fit
kat mana seh
dia macam boot
three three yes can three three laki
but dia nya location for the gym is only one place ah area
mid september I so I go home naik taxi right
and then some more my our pay is seventh of the month right so aku submit
aku submit like
and then she say it will be in ah for november pay eh ah october pay lah but I will receive in november apa
so dia pun
peng ah because dia tanya macam how much you got paid ah then after that ah he said oh
dia she just with what just graduated from poly
cause she did events management so in term of macam layan customer and all she's quite good lah like when she draft email actually not bad like no problem in terms of grammar
kesian kan entah macam bila dia datang kerja right sekarang dia datang kerja dia tak dia tak ada semangat ya demoralised I mean
wasted the cert macam tak ada guna
ah suruh dia berbual ah dengan manager cause confirm ada macam review apa dia dah habis dia nya tiga bulan
so macam sometime manager aku tanya macam okay everything okay everything okay
so kalau aku cakap dengan dia ah kalau it bothers her so much
that one point nine is just kau punya
kan aku actually kasi dia scenarios sia like some ya you try lah you try talk like that
kita kalau nak berbual kita tak boleh macam ah cakap pasal macam asal kita tak happy
yes cannot macam involve other people and knowing that they what what's their pay like because surely there is already breach of contract pe and the agreement
dia setakat hire jer
and then she said macam
dia takut ah kalau dia berbual gini
dengan manager aku ke dengan atau dia berbual dengan ke apa or maybe the boss confirm after this dia kena macam pulau
confirm kena pulau kan yes macam eh dia ni budak yang minta minta higher pay
so it's kesian ah
is not conducive at all lah I I I when I see them doing email macam annoying
yes so can you imagine you are doing email abeh you you see customer coming right
but this is not the case that's why when I see her macam one point nine is not enough sia
macam it's like a chain effect
the big bosses anuh
the another boss boss boss then after that go to manager then manager kena manager will go to us kena
second last day of january then why not then I kira kan unemployed after that ya
macam work with him lah is not work with him
then I said I I said to him lah aku aku cakap dia terus macam eh tapi kau yang ada design dia sia kau dah ada the inspiration in mind tau you already have the vision
then kau nak aku buat
tapi kalau kau nak suruh aku ambil kau nya brand I cannot

that's why I aku macam shock huh I get express shipping thank you lah
yes and is like cost you a bomb but I did my research what so I actually read up review whoever who bought the same brand uh of roller skates then I see macam okay most of them actually it said that is fit to your true size so you don't have to worry about sizing up or sizing down

I mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing jer buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji lah I'm doing this I'm doing this for your ngaji no lah remember I take video for your masak that one I haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh lah cuma um tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok I don't know lah maybe like very slow lah kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat lah kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang kan umi nak buat kan untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah

okay then you okay ni episodenya okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain lah I don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that um
ya but kalau umi buat ni umi kena consistent lah umi tak boleh buat macam
ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi kan orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh ah tapi sekarang I think better you buat macam video yang
um boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji um
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better lah
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti lah nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji kan I mean it's on they got all the sheikh sheikh all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now lah now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh mm ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that

with some you know the you remember the the the link that afiq sent to the silat group
about some gym bag yang you can sign up
tapi nak cakap apa eh
melayu aku err melayu aku melayu aku sekarang pun aku sekarang tiba-tiba tak boleh berbual
oh okay okay saya faham saya faham
it's just quite funny then wah my cat just manja like you know no tomorrow you know
okay but you know esok I tomorrow I have a meeting again
no not silat only I responded sia
cause I cause I'm reading the mail now apa
ya lah memang bukan main-main tapi afiq ada cakap pasal err kan syaz dapat kerja baru then syaz ah dia cakap macam aku boleh rasa afiq dah tak ikhlas sekarang
no tapi so aku tanya dia like kenapa dia err
okay so like I ask afiq like why he keep why does he keep holding this on macam for so long then he said that uh because syaz just got a new job then he doesn't want to err like ruin her spirit ah or something like that I don't know then I'm like that's damn that's damn bastard lah serious like damn bastard
I don't know I think they wanted to go out makan or something and then like they wanted to like because amar didn't want to be like so exclusive then he wanted to invite the two of us
because we have to keep we have to fill up the one hour usually when we talk we don't fill it up what it's like kita ada we have blanks you know
so amacam eh amacam so how
faham tapi itu so basikal bapa dia apa
ah takkan faz minta izin bapa dia habis bapa dia tak boleh ikut
ugh kenapa
apa yang okay
tapi kita nak berbual pasal apa eh
apa just just ini cakap nak berbual
apa yang kau merepek eh
eh kau punya melayu rabak juga eh
kau just just berhenti bercakap okay apa kamu
tapi aku dah lama tak berbual melayu macam gini ah so susah juga ah
kau nak kau nak kau asyik berbual bahasa baku jer that's why kekok
tercakap bahasa inggeris ah
memusnahkan recording ini recording dalam bahasa melayu apa
so kita sekarang tengah merakam pe
kenapa dah lama tahu bahasa melayu kan jadi macam gini
yang tertiba okay okay aku faham aku faham
err aku just tak faham ah kau nak cakap apa eh
dulu kita err apa eh
apa yang kau tengah berbual eh
ya allah susah
kenapa kau kena pakai saya awak ini ah
oh gitu
okay jadi kita nak berbual pasal apa sekarang
boleh juga lah kita buat gitu
kau asyik cakap benda just
kenapa eh
aku rasa tak ah
tapi sekarang ini kita speak in full sentences ke
ah okay ah macam gitu ah
dude your oh my god your malay sounds so kekok
kenapa eh
but macam mana you terkeluar Zoom
okay tak apa I I ajar you macam mana nak pakai Zoom dulu cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
okay lepas tu kena sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I punya sign in is just under sign in with tapi kalau you punya personal I would think you have to um sign in pakai
your own email lah tak okay but let's just pretend macam you ada your own email okay
okay so like selalunya when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will macam send you a link kan then like from from the link you you just
select you can see like my background kat sini kan you it's apa um it's virtual screen so maknanya my background takleh nampak lah
kalau kalau messy kalau
so you can change like your virtual background ah at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I selalu pakai virtual background cause belakang messy kan so I don't want to like show my background so kalau it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
tak ni dah log in dah
so uh you can also add in your own photo so for me I macam I create I even created my own background just to
bagi lawa lah so I I use this
tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni kan it's
so background is done and then um apa lagi nak tahu
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet dengan iPad I think ah ya
I'm not sure about um apa not android apa nama dia Windows punya laptop but
so kalau I pakai desktop kan
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp punya web
ya but if I pakai if I choose the Google chrome punya kan
so even kalau macam I tengah pakai Google chrome lepas tu I open WhatsApp web
dia tak akan nampak I punya WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome punya err window
so like this would be hard macam uh once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just um
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know selalu macam
you selalu cakap then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper orang boleh dengar
and then it goes the same for the video lah kalau your video takde they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me dalam class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
ni lah
tak yang tunjuk you tadi
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad dia akan tanya kalau you nak err apa
macam for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers tadi um
so even kalau even kalau dia
so kalau you pakai video kan
uh apa nama dia
actually you can see yourself lah kat tepi
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are apa the video is done I mean the video is off
apa done
and then other basic things is like macam
raise up your hands or err apa
okay I don't really have it oh dengan yes no
okay so they will just ask oh ah who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just angkat tangan
tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini lah
apa rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
so record is just you boleh tengok balik lah the recording
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record macam macam that time I conduct my master classes right
macam movie gitu
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then susah lah
ya then lepas tu I just um I tried out uh record on cloud
then orang akan just
ya orang akan be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
chat ah okay cause ni tak ada participants sekarang kan so
mm then you know you can change err to everyone ataupun to a specific person
mm tak boleh
tapi kan ada orang cakap yang like what like the host who
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer kat dalam kelas lah ya
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message kan you have to make sure yang apa you you click back to everyone
tapi kan sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages uh your and messages apa to everyone
ya so you just have to macam baca betul-betul lah like which one is everyone which one is to you only
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to apa to to my friend ah
breakout rooms is just uh macam tadi you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of macam
lepas tu orang tu nak breakout into smaller groups to do group work
macam create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant bila I tengah tengah tengok
cause for adults I don't think you guys pakai much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks apa
ya so if you like uh if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say macam I conduct my fundraising master classes kan the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
mm I think it's better than apa what's the other option the outlook is it live live
but it's so susah just now
no but like but like what was your apa what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room ada virtual
I tak
I tak pernah pergi lah but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
cakap lah
apa it's the starting of the
I mean technically it's in the poem also what so like even if you baca like
but this is done by the escape room punya punya company lah
oh so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator macam team bonding facilitator right
cause cause got my for my global studies punya apa
no it's like macam okay basically if it's physical kan in school then they will give you like nearing to exams lah macam your apa midterms or your final year then they will give you like err a literal goody bag
then inside macam ada foolscap ada snacks ada like ya then like all these are like
err apa get
promote ah sponsorship ah sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship lah but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty punya goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small apa faculty group kan
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but um is to try out our apa
um room punya fee
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run dulu lah
tak tak tak kita play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you nak orang uh you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want what kan ya
you have to source out for the for the people lah but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android punya phone
and then cause at first they tried to apa
E-vouchers for apa three different three different categories macam welfare eh welfare pula beauty uh food and macam activities lah like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end macam I think they just decided
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to macam we tried to
apa delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships tak reply cause COVID sekarang then even their organisations not doing well apa the companies not doing well
like even like activity punya entertainment places pun tak not
ya then now I just finished my fundraising punya series oh
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first macam kita
we just like no confidence ah macam it's so susah
uh members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism lah he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also macam donate in bulks what like you and mama
seventy per cent seventy per cent pula seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot what
just you sorang jer
apa embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think macam is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that one a bit but in the end err a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class macam it's not that bad lah ya
cause it was still macam ramai then she was like oh my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like oh ha ha ha nasib baik cause there's only like
three people yang sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people yang sign up
from the faculty punya group
oh at first he I don't really know him but I just tahu pasal he lives in my for
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance macam I saw his uh
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time pasal
ah this excel course lah pastu I macam and I wanted to join that time tapi I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
I was dengan tengah planning for this fundraising I was thinking like hmm like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought macam I think
err apa
not hands-on macam very practical skills that people would need macam in their workplaces in their school right
he was just like ya sure sure lepas tu I I went to find out err he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like oh my god so kesian then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
dah I told him already but
two and half cause the maximum kita anuh is
actually I don't even know what's abang doing
like what what what did he macam in the end
oh bukan as in what is he selling like what kan dia
oh macam
macam GrabFood lah
so it's it's just plain rice chicken dengan just different sauce
mana seh
I don't know I just go novena untuk err skin centre
ya but the soft launch abang nak buat apa
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court ke in a
in a shopping mall ke
okay lah like atas atas punya food court cause I heard like there's apa
err pasal it's this semester is all online kan I didn't even step in school like for one moment
err go back to school to study apa
no at first cannot sekarang dah boleh
but jauh
you boleh tampines hub is the most not conducive environment ever
it's so bising you ever went there before
it's so bising like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay lah understand but like
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside yang kat atas semua it's so hard
but like two hours macam so sikit if I want to study there
ya and then nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun
some establishments macam Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
tapi it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam err my job punya module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to cam use all these
your laptop semua kan
even if you have friends macam
paiseh kan nak tanya
so it's usually like like apa a combination of err topics
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought macam lebih lebih bagus ah
uh non exam modules and two exams pastu I macam happy lah yay three three modules no exam
ah ambil kau semua submission at the same time cause usually
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually lah err the macam apa submission the deadline is
tak tahu kenapa lah but it's just like that ah
but the assignment like most of my assignments here um especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating nya assignment
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy punya mod
my major apa
so you you bayangkan I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
semua yes you see
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same sama-sama
macam now
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you tak percaya you tanya kak shima the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just belajar for that one
uh like you belajar for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
I just got my I just go my apa
twenty third november baru end
then cause different assignments is different weightages apa
like like I think it's cause macam they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
mesti I macam huh
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we dapat results you macam
lagi cepat stress
you naik year three year four it gets harder and harder what you have to take harder modules kan
I just want to macam freeze my lah so that it won't macam tak turun tak naik I mean I mean naik is possible it's very hard for you to naik lah honestly
ya tak turun lah basically
dorang nak tunggu vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already lah but unfortunately tak ada vaccine
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round punya dah actually dah tutup
but then they just buka balik then they said oh it's until oh it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so macam tak kira kalau you ada you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
my major punya requirement is that
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like macam group work
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out lah I tak boleh pergi lah
mm so sem one but my course my my major ada this requirement that you kena ambil this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so kalau you miss out in sem one tak boleh ambil in sem two jer tau
two uh apa different modules from two different universities
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a macam group work gitu ya
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with um just like err apa nama dia
uh doing online kalau boleh
if you are apa namanya I lost my train of thoughts already ayah keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling pula it's actually trying to like
take two different err from two different schools macam macam mana you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
I don't really have hope yang kita akan pergi lah cause it's ya it's quite hard
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is macam tak baik lah like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
no kalau kalau
kalau one kalau one year then I won't lah like no and and it's not just them it's like
the faculty I mean my major macam just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but the the new application yang dorang kasi it's more
apa there's more options ah
kena submit lagi ah
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject apa and you and you won't
you've been looking forward to this but nasib baik I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what takde
know like kak shima stay in the hall everything
what it what people are mad about is like macam the the college tak
they don't they don't dia tak relay apa-apa
only after two weeks they reported baru ada like
the laki lah
it took two weeks just to macam do something then that speaks a lot what
jap eh ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni
jap jap and then after that like they and then we were like
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know macam sensation lah like the media just wants to like keep on uh saying oh again
no but but in but kita punya people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
hi uh my name is rismah I'm eighteen years old this year and my birthday is coming so tolonglah belikan present ke apa ke
err lagi err
kebanyakan buah lah sebab err cause I like mango and
oval kot
ada yang oval ada yang bulat tergantung ah
tergantung buah dia nak grow macam mana
uh itu jer
itu jer kot sebab
betul lah kata err abang saya ini dia
ada yang bengkok ada yang straight
ada juga mango yang panjang kalau kau orang pernah nampak lah but then
itu jer
sebab mango ini kan it's very very sweet and
jangan cakaplah bila okay ah kadang uh nak makan mango ini ada kalau kau orang pernah lah
err kadang ada yang tersangkut dekat gigi lah
ada yang terselit dekat sana sini lah sebab kan dia orang punya apa itu
cause mango pun dia punya biji dia ada macam tali
so nanti dia orang terstuck dekat gigi ke apa ke but
other than that macam it's really really sweet and okay kalau kau orang nak tahu
cakap tadi yang ada colour
apa oren lah hijau lah merah lah kalau korang nak tahu um hijau is mango um mangga muda
um means uh mango yang masih belum masak lah and if you want to know the sweetest mango is the red mango
ah kalau kau orang nampak red mango itu lah mango paling sedap dalam dunia
so kenapa dia favourite sebab mango they're just relaxing they just
dia macam very juicy boleh buat juice and
oh banyak pun ada giant pun ada
ah cold storage pun banyak so
but macam macam ah nak cari mango ini dekat dingapore memang senang gila
so um jangan jangan apa
err pergi try lah I mean pergi try makan mango kalau siapa siapa yang tak suka makan mango pergi try confirm akan tambah lagi
mesti ada confirm because
so people will confirm keluarkan product product mango um like lip balm ke yang rasa mango
atau lipstick yang rasa mango kita mana tahu kan betul tak
lagi um

mesti lah
mesti ada macam bingsu ada flavour mango
habis lepas itu um recently my friend bawa kan uh I
apa eh um I think it's a mango float I uh they call it mango float
so dalam pun ada mango and
every single dessert eh confirm for me ada mango punya
sebab kalau tak ada mango tak sah that's me okay kalau tak ada mango tak sah mesti ada mango punya kalau
tak ada mango tak nak makan
kan betul tak
ada diabetes uh diabetes ke it's also good for their health tahu kalau dia orang nak makan mango pun
sebab it's a fruit it's bukan makanan manis it's not too sweet it's not too bitter so
boleh uh mango ni boleh dimakan dari segi um budak dari budak budak sampai lah ke orang tua
and ya like I said it's very very healthy so kalau boleh kau orang makan lah mango and
mango ni colour dia yellow tahu colour dia unique gila and
colour dia is macam matahari macam apa
apa word itu um macam um apa menyinari eh apa
uh ah like macam dia just
and bila kalau um like my brother said ada mango mango tea eh
kalau telan itu fulamak dekat dalam tekak boleh rasa sampai dekat dalam badan it's really really really refreshing guys so kau orang kena try mango kalau kau orang tak pernah try

mango tak ada recipe lah like you can do whatever you want with mango you can smash it you can just eat it
and bukan makanan jer yang dia orang keluarkan dia orang keluarkan syrup juga
betul tak I mean like they uh they they they

then you telan during these summer days
tengok my accent pun dah jadi woo macam sebab dah sedap sangat dalam otak ini walaupun tak makan
I pun tak tahu so because
kalau dekat sekolah ada kerja I'm just going to do it
but when dekat rumah macam tiba-tiba nak
like cause mostly kita kan kita semua ada practical kita semua ada theory
and kalau kat sekolah ada practical I will always do it and kalau dekat rumah ah like he said home based learning
kalau ada theory
I'm just going to revise ah if tak then I'm just going to listen to whatever
cikgu explain ke or
other subjects ke other topics I'm just going to listen
but other than that I think kalau dekat sekolah I'm productive kot because mostly I'm doing
tak pernah malas ah tak tak pernah sekali malas ah
malas pun kalau dah penat kalau dah shag gila
tapi um my last meal
entah I I I I come back
jangan cakap lah eh I think my favourite food for now it's um chicken chop
black pepper dia orang is just
ada rasa lah like confirm ada rasa punya lah macam
tak boleh describe ah sebab sedap sangat you know macam nak makan sekarang juga you know something like that have you ever felt like that way when you talk about your favourite food and then you feel like you're hungry right now
betul-betul gila I mean like
kita macam tak berbual pasal makan pun we're still hungry
apa lagi kalau tengok kalau tengah tengah penat eh habis tengah lapar habis scroll instagram
oh my god macam dah itu tak apa sedap pula itu and
lagipun it's very rare for us to find in singapore so
hais buat lapar jer
I don't know if you guys tahu ke tak syafiq kyle
he's a malaysian um actor and dia pernah main dekat cerita nur
as dalam dekat cerita nur ini
dia main sebagai um
as an ustad
dia baru balik jordan for um untuk apa
err mengetahui lagi uh lebih lanjut dia punya pengetahuan sebagai ustad lah like
he wants to become an ustad you know because his family is really really pious well he came from a pious family
with a what do you call pelacur
dia nak cari err apa
dia nak cari err
so I think this cerita boleh you know
dari cerita nur because cerita nur is mostly all about err religious yang
siapa-siapa yang suka tengok cerita yang you know ada ustad habis ada you know macam
yang suka dengar ah ayat-ayat suci al-quran
you can just uh pergi tengok cerita nur because
apa lagi bila syafiq kyle tengah
fuh syafiq kyle tengah baca al-quran
merdu gila like
banyak lagi ah my ah I have a polaroid of him
I hope kau orang yang tahu situation COVID nineteen ini
tolong lah pakai mask eh tak mahu tak mahu tak pakai mask
because wati sounds like you know bibik bibik punya nama
macam makcik-makcik punya nama you know like bibik wati no please no I mean only only my families can but not my friends okay not
sampai december and I'll be graduating already and I think I'm planning to take um maybe
err talking about language err languages ah I can speak macam biasa melayu
then nanti you nak tengok cerita apa
Greenland apa lagi
to be honest kan I don't know how they record
like macam mana macam mana dia orang record
so then tiba tiba kerja continue continue continue then err
but what if they start recording okay tak apa ah then that means the movie wouldn't be out what
I mean pernah lah macam let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel kan
then macam oh disney channel then got mulan then tengok ah then like oh whatever
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad macam rasa
disappointed pasal anak dia perempuan so tak ada orang yang boleh carry on
okay what do you mean by terpaksa because if she's terpaksa kan okay at first she's a guy eh she's a woman
tak tak pernah tengok that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
she she sakit then she baring I think sick or whatever I don't know
orang tengah berbual pasal mulan
oh so even okay the dad tak boleh pasal dia sakit
tapi in the in that government even though kau sakit ke apa eh sorry
even though if you sakit
okay even if you sakit or not tak kisah you have to go is that the rule
so the the mulan dia macam kasihan kan that's why she left that note
oh what to curi
no tak the first wish yang dia buat is dia nak jadi prince
I think bukan renovation it's just macam err
ya there's no one tapi that time eh that time I went is before corona is it
cause they I think pasal dia orang dah tukar eh
yang wave wave pool the big one
dia macam very mundane the wave not really like power
no longkang longkang yang jalan sendiri lazy pool
ah longkang longkang
and the actual olympic punya swimming
you you try move your apa ni paket you taruh depan you
pasal kalau you tengok you punya sound wave kan dia macam when you kill let's say
grey tuan
oh cause my one dia gerak banyak seh maybe because my voice is loud ah
okay okay you see ah my my wave besar tahu
I I jauh begini pun boleh dengar
there was this one girl yang
I was with macam sama sekolah
so kita just grow like from nursery K one eh
nursery K one K two whatever whatever whatever kan sampai P six
then my adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas
so then dia orang macam kacau kacau my adik kan adik dia lah
kalau they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume yang kau orang ada benda
ya so begitu jer lah tapi
it was just like macam
a topic in macam mak bapa berbual
bila primary six
kan then I tak tahu kenapa ah
then macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa
ya allah eh wait eh belum habis eh jap
ya so macam uh apa ni
suka nak jumpa that kind of thing
macam cute kan P six
eh eh eh eh dia ni
ni what do you mean by you like the person you like err you eh
I thought eh sia ah dini gerek sia kalau dengan dia pun best
but I think I think my one is amplified eh like berbual
tak pasal I berbual biasa tahu this is considered normal to me tahu but then it's like
you know there's in a group there's that one that takes charge macam let's say kalau you nak keluar
there's that one guy okay lah kita gini ah then everyone macam okay ah go ah no problem macam yes
actually when the robot tu dengar gemuk
then the robot dengan dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk
so ya there's leader ni
actually just just two people tahu
so macam let's say okay
so everywhere they go kan ah okay lah jom ah like then okay lah pergi makan ah okay lah jom ah jom ah main bola ah
okay okay lah go ah that kind of ya so macam primary school what I did was
P one P two begitu
yang tapi yang ah

uh primary school lah the those macam textbook and workbook
in textbook is macam
they teach you then there's fill in the blank punya itu eh

so then that time I don't know if your your time masih ada lah tapi my time ada macam
ya so that time A kan when dia baru habis macam

apa lagi lah janaz okay okay okay
then kita berbual berbual berbual berbual lah then after that
bual bual bual bual bual bual kan
then dah berbual then my my dad want to talk to me again so my the mister tan give back the phone
then I laugh back lah he was like ha ha kenapa lah buat joke macam gitu
ni merepek jer something like that then I macam tak tahu I I then I was just laughing ah then the mister tan was just looking at me eh weirdly tahu
so I I think in his head lah pasal apa seh dia ni tengah apa tengah ketawa
dia cakap okay okay okay nevermind ah you just you you don't you don't so loud ah you just pay attention in class ah then I was like okay okay okay then hang up
then I masuk class kan semua tanya ah I remember seh
tengok eh what did you do
ya that's why macam tak kena
eh dah lama tak jumpa
yeah I'm just my friend is just to find a jobs lah flexible part time jobs you know to suit my schedule especially like my intern is not paid right  abih kena cari kerja sendiri lah
 asal boring what you doing at home
yes it almost three years already and we are gonna graduate next year  tak sabar rasanya
stress kan  kena buat ni semua but I'm glad  macam its all over already lah now dah holiday  boleh enjoy
 apa was the assignment about duh
 apa itu I tak faham
err so far only  satu je lah like one module err we learn about airport management it's quite interesting lah cause you get to learn about the operations behind a airports right like how the run or what what other things involved yeah
oh my dream job is to be stewardess lah like cause  macam you know that time the first time I took a flight to penang then the stewardess served me right then from there I was like inspired I want to be like them
so from there  macam I work hard lah to you know I do research about aviation about stewardess all these
yeah that was one of my dreams  tapi macam susah lah  nak jadi pilot you need a lot of qualification yeah so now I just want to be a stewardess first lah I see lah if
I want to work at singapore airlines lah but  banyak orang cakap susah nak masuk ah because high standard  semua so now I looking for maybe other travel budget airlines like the Scoot or Jetstar asia
oh sekarang ni I I tengah tengok drama korea ah korea ah cerita lama lah cerita legend of the blue sea
just now I eat ah  nasi with  kari daging
wah  sedap nya
 boleh jugak your mom  masak semua
 macam hari raya pulak
yeah but then like my other friends they  banyak kena campak dekat err company  yang tak related to aviation  macam logistics then like some of them will be like under administration or marketing that kind of job
 belum susah cause  aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc kind of job kan  tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard lah I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the changi airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
yeah because because like I said lah like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya lah a bit  takut ah when if you talk then you will talk alone
good lah was it a  macam manageable or stressful
 abih kau macam mana macam ada plans  nak buat business eh
tak they see eh I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers lah
just like the other cafes  semua those that sell the mains all yeah
 sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere ulu somewhere err a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the ulu places right then people want to
and cannot be ulu lah like I said
 sekarang
you mean like malay food  ke
 tauhu bergedil lah I I love that  tauhu bergedil then what else ah bubble tea the what ah oh that time I saw err dalgona bubble tea or something
yeah mostly all at bugis east area like you said lah in the west also not much  halal options cause very boring lah east is the best lah because they have a lot of good food there
a'ah  kalau kereta senang boleh pergi mana mana jer  jauh jauh pon takpe because very convenient
 selalu pergi lah  kadang kadang malam malam ikut err  abah aku pergi isi minyak isi minyak kereta err  pastu kita orang gi makan burger or we go McDonald's right then eat their burger is so nice duh I like their McDonald's menu
yeah but Ramly  dari sana but then I don't like because err  banyak sayur
oh I I've eaten before um  apa tu
it it is okay leh not is like it is a bit like err  ayam and  daging ah
I mean  daging beef a bit a bit like that it just a bit  keras
there's also err burger  arnab
I don't know why I was daring to try that deer meat lah you know cause like I'm there already so  mak I say just try something new because I like to explore what I like to try new food
then that stall also they got sell the  ais kacang
 senang ah  nak cari makanan halal untuk kita
ah I miss also I want to go the  tapak food truck
yeah like the food range for maybe seven  ringgit onwards
that time I bought the buttermilk chicken rice it's ten  ringgit
talking about  nasi lemak I remember that time I went
 abih err  kita orang makan  nasi lemak  dengan lauk lauk lauk pauk you know  nasi lemak then I I  taruk err  ayam of course  ayam ah  ayam goreng
then  taruk like some other  lauk ah like the  sambal telur you know  sambal kerang wah it's really nice
 halal food options so it's so easy for us to find  halal food so like at our hotel right err just across the street there's already like two to three  halal restaurants then as you go down the street there is more option for you lah
 tak I  pergi jogjakarta
 mertabak manis
 sedap gila seh I  suka gila
I've been getting a lot of comments  macam bapak aku dengan pak cik aku cakap eh dah dah dah  apa eh
uh huh dah  tembam
confirm boring lah your house  takde pape nak buat kan  takde three lah  takde
but then we just ignore it then we set up our picnic mat and all lah then  sekali like a few minute after that we can see like on the right side the clouds are very dark and
 sedap it just fruits lah for nothing less berries blueberries that kind of berries
no this is five dah lama
 tapi cause we are too small and mostly is
bila ah staycation
this one you planning to do for kak ain's birthday right
makan kat mana for dinner
central area lagi kalau nak makan
boleh masak Maggi
I think you all can go jalan-jalan dekat gardens by the bay before that
usually like who want to bangun pagi I cannot bangun pagi man
eh kalau staycation
have you been to the yang itu the art museum
because they have that interacting punya
I forgot the time she I think the one that mama went with kak ain dekat
japan kat tokyo they went to the japan one
then mama cakap ada
like this one this macam interacting nya board gitu so you can draw your own animals
oh then she excited macam budak kecil
since dah macam central central
and then your parents boleh
feeling sikit
because I think dekat Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
actually tengok-tengok date lah but then if you book december right you can use your voucher mah
is do you think aryan is old enough to masuk
mm then can boleh pakai seh
but you went to Malayan Council before right to makan
makan dekat sana ada that Noosh Noodle Bar
ah if you go the if you go the the art museum kan dah dekat like you walk through the helix bridge lepas tu dah belok
then dah sampai esplanade what esplanade kan][dah dekat
and nak kalau nak mengopi ada coffee bean
and then boleh jalan-jalan can take photos
yang dekat omotesando
like you know the japanese they very macam
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it dia dah toast panas-panas
then lepas tu the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
ya I feel like semua orang cakap it's um expensive lagi mahal but then I feel like if you record eh uh record pula if you um
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one dekat japan because dekat japan they have the regular size and size
dekat sini they only have size
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people nya mindset macam
ni lagi mahal seh
ah berbual for what
kat japan boleh makan pe but now you're not going japan right so
because I see dekat macam online blog gitu I feel like it's
okay lah dia macam tak lokek
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one yang tanya what is yakiniku
dekat the place itself
so they give you raw beef dia macam Seoul Garden Seoul Garden tapi it's just beef
I had the one dekat japan also it was so good the halal one
so we went and then we went for um during lunch time dia macam tak crowded even though there's so many people at the
and then they had dish macam dish eh
they had this macam
um raw beef set like the bento tapi with raw beef
then the griller dekat depan
so you get to grill your own tapi it's like a bento
dish is like lauk right
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the roti
but it's a dish mah so I thought it's um macam should be included
okay I think I will choose um clam vongole mama punya clam vongole
with lots of cili padi and um
confirm rumah dia besar eh
like have you seen um will smith punya rumah
it's like tingkat bertingkat and then kat belakang ada swimming pool
uh apa tu
will smith punya rumah punya gambar
dorang jalan jauh-jauh pun they will stay around their house
ada macam living room a'ah
dia just kekal
you can be tak handsome but then have a good uh fit body tapi I'm like
once you have a fit body kalau muka tak handsome then I'm like
like you see some model pun macam
eh badan dia buff seh sekali dia pusing ah kau
genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
my favourite channel is the crime investigation channel dekat rumah
tapi sekarang dah tak ada seh
uh like for example conjuring dengan annabelle
because dia macam okay they want to act
make it macam as if oh betul betul happening betul betul like
abeh macam if you macam fikir balik like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven gitu
I mean it's a good macam
maybe dulu is a good macam good thing for a change lah
don't know I like the way she tells the story macam very interesting like she doesn't macam she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't macam
macam tak boring gitu
you know some people nanti dorang macam berbual berbual
and then halfway it gets boring because macam too draggy
tapi and then this
ya I I finished all the ones dekat Facebook
dekat YouTube is still ongoing
there's this one movie dekat Netflix
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix macam a few years ago I thought dia baru keluar
because dulu when
dia keluar bila two thousand eight kan eh two thousand eighteen
the movie keluar
why recently Netflix macam dorang released so many macam documentaries
tomorrow kerja petang seh I think malam that malam after since tutup I think I can watch
macam dah lama nak lah like you wish
so dari kecil sampai sekarang you like
rumah besar as in like
so like balas jasa gitu
tapi dulu when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school kot lupa
ya then dia tak serabak now lah like
tapi COVID is like
from one country then lepas tu another country then lepas tu tiba-tiba like the whole world sampai
airports semua tutup sia like
like tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this macam seriously
tu ah
I mean tapi sekarang re-election so I feel like
tapi macam tu lah I mean korang nak the COVID to finish
to end to finally like macam
no more new cases tu semua everybody to heal
until tak nak dengar like to wear mask wash your hands
tapi orang tak nak dengar then like
esok kerja eh
esok kerja petang seh
you know my tempat kerja ada budak baru
it's a malay guy then he budak T
he's on internship and because I thought when he masuk
usually kalau
oh I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so macam terkejut like oh you from polytechnic I'm like oh ya
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the macam
like you know the courses tu semua how the works tapi macam
macam sensitive issue lah because they usually macam
deal with macam money money um orang bayarkan
dorang bayar duit tu join courses tu semua so maybe they like
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes ke apa ke
so they will only let the senior yang kerja lama kat sana tu
so kita orang usually ada
kita duduk counter jer kat
ya lah dekat office ah
so dah passion card layan tu ni but then
to um apa tu apply for you know the
under macam not everything can buat right
a'ah especially kalau macam the
issue is about government punya duit like government bagi duit because of this COVID right so they'll think like
they already like refer them to us then after that kita orang macam then they come to the then after that we tell them that
then you know macam tak happy lah
ya then after that the other day got this one makcik lah she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
we cannot even like use other people punya computer
your issue lah tapi macam for us is sensitive because
sekali kalau apa-apa ya
sekali your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
jap tengok dia punya battery
ya so I said go to but then dorang cakap ah very far I cannot walk and all
oh but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit leceh so far
adik stop
dia cakap she applied
uh apa tu she passed away
that means the person punya mum
but then they keep like arguing macam
especially if it's like racial issue macam
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a makcik who came
if there's a makcik who come by
tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita kan melayu
so it's like that my kerja is like that
uh as a housing officer dekat dormitory punya office
mm I'll be in the office lor so basically kalau that office is for the foreign workers kalau let's say they have
pay them on time ke apa like this kind of problem they will come to the office and tu
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing macam roundings ke apa ke so you like
dia kata macam you know macam Expo event but every day
eh medical interview pula the medical check-up
dorang berbual english
orh okay tu tempat landed landed nya tempat oh okay okay
then kalau macam
so that means the classes macam
like let's say if the that means one teacher ada fifteen right then means half of that
macam like around tujuh ke lapan orang then halfway dorang uh balik tidur
they also belajar
usually macam after dorang punya macam so called
before that makan ke lepas tu makan
oh dorang makan dulu eh orh so macam
then makan
jaga budak ya I think it's
dia macam malu eh
you got listen to misteri jam dua belas or not
huh tak ah aku tak berani I mean aku takut kena kacau sekali tu aku dah takut ya eh I think I told you right that time then ya I was studying at home I think I was twelve ah I was studying at home right then the the
eh you let's listen together no no I add sound effects what the hell I mean you know my place my areas sana banyak keras kan shit lah
dulu eh kau tinggal situ
wait your house is dekat fuchun fuchun primary baru ke fuchun primary lama is it near marsiling primary
ya ya ya ya I know mm you know what is keras right one look you know that is keras
I I only went to the old fuchun for apa tu for uh orientation I was like my first year in my primary school because but my first my first uh my first year in primary school was at the new one it's just that when I orientation it was at the old one
I don't know but I remember I think I think your parents apply for primary school then they give you like macam mana I think you bid when I think it's bidding right is it by bidding or something no I think for uh apa tu pun sama kan uh the kindergarten I think because my sister she did the same thing I think she bid for placement
so it's not enough place they'll put you another place ya they said fuchun was uh one of the best primary schools there a lot produces a lot of uh apa they say a lot of high scorpions and which is true ah
old uh old fuchun was haunted new fuchun was okay lah I mean it was not as keras
like apa evergreen they didn't have like brownies it was red cross or then there was then I was like mm okay lah red cross sounds like similar sekali I join aku join
I mean it wasn't hard I mean I join I enjoyed it it was just different because brownies was like uh buy my cookies you know like uh uh was an elf or like a pixie you know then you will learn how to cook learn how to sew but brownie was like was really like you know footdrills ya they really make sure you do so like you're you know you like ya because you had to do evacuation and things like that first aid my specialty was red cross knowledge history basically like the history we learn we had to learn about apa tu the founder lah things like that apa tu
I only had apa eh
kesian got try got try
masak we we learnt how to not really it's like nutrition is a bit like like like nutrition ah like our current nutrition class it's just that was more they they need more hands on cooking
had to cook ya I had to put during fasting month batal sia legit terbatal puasa aku I was like unconsciously I was like hmm rasa masin tak shit ya I was like ya oh my god oh no then I was like am I supposed to spit it out my friends was like ah batal jer lah then I was like alahai shit lah tak sengaja then ya you can okay lah I mean I felt guilty for like I was like okay lah batal batal lah it's fine I ganti anyways
err like basically musical theory then they taught us to play recorder pianica entah
I was in charge of the gong but it's like apa tu
but I was late once and they had to switch me over or something then I change it's like ya the drum is like I forgot what's the name of the instrument but it's like one side is smaller one side is bigger then ya I wanted to use the kompang kompang you know or the or the small one no not rebana it's the it's the long one then it's like it's the you know you know apa tu
err pontianak harum sundal malam you know the long one the metal with the round thing at the top ya then ya I wanted to play that that's a part of gamelan gamelan is the name of the whole thing what orchestra bukan xylophone panjang-panjang wait ya it's something like xylophone lah ah bulat-bulat
ya lah I had to uh I had to masuk gamelan play guitar piano had to learn piano apa tu ha they made us dance they made us fusion dance then uh contempt I was like oh my god do I look like I can dance hmm
I'm more of a musician ha me is not uh apa tu dancer you know saya bukan penari ya I was like okay ah apa tu then for sports we had to learn floorball in primary school floorball
then apa tu
played a lot lah we played a lot I was good at sports but when you know you had to run around like run around the field you know to warm up I'm like orh tak nak tak nak tak nak then it's like
qiam jer
ya it was rumah orang kan
buat bodoh jer
primary five then secondary school sec two you know always they had the night walks right it was at the you know those really old camps did you watch okay you watched incredible tales right you saw yang you know about the the the the
kena like kena jalan lah macam dia orang tarukkan glow stick kan lepas tu
dia orang apa tu dia orang bagi kau jalan dengan the first person kena pegang dia punya torchlight then yang belakang tu you know then macam kena taruk tangan atas bahu
caterpillar gitu ha I was usually either the first or the last one because I wasn't scared you know I'm not scared lah so but the weirdest thing you at what for some reason once kan what happened was aku tengah like everything was okay like it it started out fine
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite lah so basically after the uh night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then tepuk ah something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
but the what weird like apa tu
benda yang pelik yang terjadi kan actually selepas tu
like so basically kan like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle kan so yang dia punya faci dia kan the eh no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut lah because I was injured right so they uh they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we sampai dia punya campsite kan
I don't know they they they were getting ready to eat apa tu supper eh ya then they showered already then one of my friends like err apa tu where where did you go lah right why you said I thought you take shortcut oh why you take so long ah I'm uh then aku macam
aku tak tahu sia
I don't know I don't know it didn't feel very long it felt like it was short but the problem is when we reach everyone was either showered or the last few are showering you know that kan so you can you think do you like people shower you you get the girls and all lama juga lah kan ha lama juga so I was oh my god until now I can't figure out what happened but ya
it's near a madrasah also right
why would you put your kubur there tanah ah
kampung sia what I'm weird is one thing that is that in the hustle and bustle of the city
macam kampung pula kan
no I think they know because I went to search up on you know where to visit you know we we always do those visits right and I was searching where to visit ah then I saw this one place they said kubur melayu tengah-tengahnya apa tu kat bugis juga I think
like beside that's why when the moment you said oh kat bugis right then I was like is it near the near the madrasah and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous lah I mean who would think
kan I mean the only time I experienced that was that time kampung lah
aku nak pergi surau because I used to I used to stay over at my pakcik's house right and
my pakcik and makcik orang malaysia right orang malaysia kau tau lah rumah dia orang kat kampung-kampung kan so one one of the kampung is kalau nak daripada surau dah habis solat nak kena jalan balik tu kena lalu kubur
okay lah okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you pergi surau you won't go alone what especially because I budak singapore kan mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana especially because malaysia you know ah there's a lot of those cases right so
banyak ah bukan culik jer habis
so it's like I mean seram is seram but yang paling seram is one of my uncle's house dekat ni jalan tan kee it's kat eh but I think they move ah already it was damn dilapidated
it's like the area was macam it was how to say ah they want to
pecahkan they want to pecahkan and nak buat rumah baru but it's like dia orang tak nak move because they were miskin kan so it's like apa tu
like as a kid I was like entah I don't know but it smelt really bad so as a kid you know biasa lah you know very particular right so tak nak tak nak masuk tunggu dalam van but we me and my cousin got stuck in the van the lock rosak ya they had to send it to a kedai to get it fixed but anyways lah so basically it's like you know it's the really old kampung type like you want shower right must go out ya it's under the pokok then my mum was like when I was showering with my mum my mum was like jangan tengok atas
pokok kekabu weh
no it's open air it's zinc oak lah it's just a zinc panels sebelah kiri kanan habis you know it's the dia punya tempat air dia orang simpan air kat tempayan you know those
ya it's like you know those kimchi kimchi jars yes they put water in it dah rupa baldi tau habis dah lah air sejuk
aku nangis sumpah aku tak berani aku tak berani pergi toilet sorang-sorang tau aku kalau pergi toilet masa kat kampung ibu ibu pergi ibu pergi lah sorang ibu no I'm not going to go alone toilet dah lah kat luar tengah-tengah malam masa tu nak shower sorang-sorang you know you imagine my family from singapore all the way to all the way to malaysia kan then you take bath all the way then melekit kalau tak tak nak solat lagi
ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone oh my god dah lah masa tu tengah ada case apa tu you know they masa that one is early two thousand still got case of apa tu orang minyak ke apa kan something like that
pengamal pengamal they they they practise like magic no they amal it like
you you know how some you know how some people buang dia orang punya pad darah dia orang kan dia orang nak lawa kan dia orang nanti ambil dia orang baca-baca dia orang ambil dia orang punya darah uzur tu dia orang taruk kat muka dia orang baca-baca that's how lah dia orang amal lah macam orang ya because like you know how they simpan jin simpannya hantu raya simpannya simpannya cik kak kan apa
balik kampung no
no I don't know I don't know eh I think I don't know eh is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between langsuir and pontianak
oh yang nenek tu eh
bomoh eh
is it the makcik bomoh that one that episode
ya the one that the guy potong kuku malam-malam then the guy the other guy bukanya payung dalam rumah kan ya ya why what's your question
apa apa no penanggal penanggal lain do you realise it's the same thing because nananggal is the philippines term for penanggal penanggal is melayu
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy kan philippines indonesia melayu orang orang singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that aiya anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore lah
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's pontianak you were saying
oh one of the one of the oh it wasn't in the it wasn't in the oh ya ya ya ya ya the penanggal yang takde so basically the apa tu the organs that one right ya it's not a joke my dad used to oh ya you know I I did the interview right so basically uh for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know zaman dulu is yang apa tu tali dia hanging kan kat atas it wasn't underground like now kan ya so basically singapore ha kat kat malaysia tak lah kat singapore lah so basically like apa tu they had to change dia punya lines kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia uh telephone lama dia orang kan rosak then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was ah it's technician ah electric punya technician so basically what happened was that you know if you tukar senja-senja you'll see sometimes the penanggal head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say eh penanggal is not really macam it's not like hantu raya it's not like pontianak it's not dead oh it's practice they say eh they pengamal they like orang minyak kan amal black magic so it's like apa tu
ha they practise ah but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know err orang minyak is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something aku tak ingat right no no no he made a made a perjanjian dengan syaitan then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery sia plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not bomoh lah but you work with syaitan right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
entah lah suka hati kau lah nak
oh dia nak makan anak dia I think
oh awet muda
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get uh malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their tingkap
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow ah they say that err they put because they are this one jin or ghost kan hantu kan that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same jin that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the rahim they they eat the janin right they that's why they say what zaman dulu maghrib jer tutup tingkap then they then they will hang like paku-paku atau punya apa tu
garam kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason garam is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad pagar rumah or not but ya
ya they say what is it ah what what daun apa also not ketumbar but they say LOL ketumbar untuk makan there's one daun they use to like apa tu
I don't know what's the name of the daun but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like apa tu uh
anasir-anasir sihir or something like that
they said they use it for kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke they use the daun or something I don't remember this one daun they even sell sabun or like sabun because who want to buy daun and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as tanah liat you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the jins are quite chicken sia I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who sambut the baby
I mean like I said lah the the the jin we were talking about this it eats uh it steals babies and things like that that's why they say what actually the the reason behind oh need to go back inside the house uh uh sebelum maghrib right
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then sekali got extra nurse the one that sambut your baby oh no oh my god hell no because my mum says that it's very keras lah that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things what everywhere got things what even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like oh they talking about me
ugh two bad you don't you don't go to camp sia but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya tidur mati ah ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind lah I wear specs lah but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau that's why
baca ke tak baca it won't stop me from getting disturbed
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the syarahan-syarahan they say actually jin can apa tu manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
I think rather than hasutan right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake what ya so basically it's not exactly hasutan but it's more of because hasutan are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see err like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say what apa eh iman kuat or semangat kuat or something right then they said that apa tu
oh so since like this person semangat kuat akan disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister lemah semangat kan so dia kena kacau instead of my father
because my kakak penakut I think no wonder anak dia pun ikut lah pergi toilet pun bushu can you open the light for me mother never open the door please lah how old already you put switch on the light lah your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I kena tap before
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet lah whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me ha I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like oh my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just khayal like if it's like uh you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this one is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
ustaz say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
oh my god have you seen the the penampakan like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
I honestly feel that K lah the one that I I I I'm a sceptic lah like you if you post on macam kan dia orang buka dia orang macam tunjuk kan
dia orang nak views kot
I feel like I I believe more those yang macam amateur amateur ones that macam a that one scares me for real like I saw one kan and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's ada show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still kampung kot
maybe dia orang tak no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my nenek ada saka kan
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have saka
I I like it's hard to find people with susuk in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers kan it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody bomoh ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find bomoh bomoh pun uh wah golden golden apa tu
uh apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda LOL what
so leceh
for susuk or like if you jaga like if you ada saka ke apa kan kena jaga lama seh ha kain kuning lah pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor so apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh
I don't know I don't know I don't have susuk I don't have saka buluh kot buluh
eh tak lah payung
I don't know I think buluh has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said daun or air garam maybe like buluh has some
dia docker ke apa metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's galah galah galah galah metal kat dalam rumah apa kalau metal kat dalam rumah apa you need to walk under the galah
but why would you walk under the galah when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the galah if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
I guess but then again if you do susuk probably you won't you will be more aware lah I mean zaman sekarang I wouldn't know lah tengah main handphone alamak jalan bawah galah bodoh apa the heck but ya
kau ingat kau ingat burger ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out terkeluar right you because ah you become uglier
that's what they say if your your susuk keluar you become buruk
cerita hantu eh
macam botox ah it's just that botox is err it stays inside your skin
I guess so can you imagine your bomoh dies then you're you're you are no lah eh but then
nazak right I think that's I think that's common ah
so you suffer more when you die ah macam saka ah
you cannot die tenteram
they say when they leave you to put inside your kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you kafan you they they can feel them showering you things like that
it's like pakai baju biasa ah eh please lah you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers kafan won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like alah asal dia orang tak taruk banyak cloth bodoh sejuk siol bajet ke satu layer jer tu lah pasal tapi eh dia orang kafan sampai tu apa
kain kafan all the way apa guess you have stockings
kain batik just to cover your atas jer but your kafan is all white ah
it's just to cover the face so people don't macam stare at you or something it's just macam you okay if like you eat nasi lemak will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the sayur all what
mayat jijik ah no but there are cases if you know right when allah tak nak terima your death kan then you apa ada the maggots or like ular atau apa tu nanah
it will push you back out or like your kubur will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
dia duduk balik is it
they just I I the one that I know is jangan when they say terima tak or whatever ambil beban ke apa don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
biar allah ambil beban
or may allah take your syaitan
during nazak a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the bumbung you know zinc kampung right so they use zinc punya bumbung kan so for like when the person tengah nazak kan dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar
kau ingat kau kau ingat convertible ke apa they had to climb and open it lah kau ni bodoh but ya lah they have to open the zinc bumbung then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves ah because I think I I don't know if you saw yang jangan pandang belakang they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy terima nenek dia punya benda tu I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum cakap the thing
he's recording sia the thing apa tu
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a saka
I don't have a saka I'm a sucker but I don't have a saka you get me but ya it's like um
don't have worldly desires tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat uh apa tu
basic willing to help people gitu ah sincere lah so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my pakcik makcik and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum wow she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work
ya because zaman tu right zaman tu perempuan kena cuci rumah and masak
okay abang so how our renovation plans
hari raya wah you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate hari raya yet
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate hari raya
why are we talking about hari raya
so nanti I pergi um
nanti I pergi Popular I beli cardboard
I beli kertas yang keras tu then uh I
cari gambar nanti I print
nanti I cetak nanti I print lepas tu nanti boleh tampal lah dekat cardboard itu
tak lah itu itu kena tunggu nanti nanti bila jumpa dengan dia punya
apa designer itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita just um
kita just baca-baca jer tak tahu betul ke tak ke kan
buat lawak ah
kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang company err company itu nak apa nak
tunjuk kita nak bagi kita kan jadi
jadi kita just
kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi jer lah letak kat dalam mood board itu
hari itu I dah tunjuk you gambar dekat WhatsApp dah tengok belum
ha ya lah habis group mana
corak oh okay ah if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
betul juga uh uh eh paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua uh apa itu
uh almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu
orang yang uh cucikan sofa
sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu actually dari daripada minyak masak
lepas itu uh yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat uh platform itu
yang yang dulu actually nak buat musollah lepas itu tak jadi
sebenarnya bukan nak hack nak nak buang uh yang lama punya platform sebab
sebab platform itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput
tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput lah itu dah nak err dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang
lepas itu bawah platform itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak
uh huh buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak vinyl dulu kan lepas itu nanti dah ada
letak vinyl dan kalau ada budget then baru boleh tambah platform
okay tak apa itu nanti
that one I that one that idea came from tak I nampak hari itu my friend dia tengah buat renovation sekarang
lepas itu dia upload dekat uh story
lepas itu dia pakai glass itu ah um dia pun ada that same same sama punya segi balcony lepas itu dia
ah dia dia yang dia yang I nampak daripada story dia lah yang dia pakai glass itu kalau tidak I pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak replace that that tingkap dengan
dengan apa so idea dia datang itu lah I ternampak story my friend
dia ada tag hari itu tapi I tak ingat ada dia ada tag uh
dia dia popular juga apa eh nama dia eh tak ingat ah
ya habis sekarang I scolding ah everytime they upload video
ah nanti I pergi intai dia punya video tengok apa progress cari idea
abang you boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada you tolong scolding kan ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah I
I kan tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya uh tingkap cantik
dia satu yang dia pakai yang uh sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya uh yang macam ketat
uh ketat punya macam mana nak cakap eh yang ada yang ada handle eh
ah tapi cantik dia macam simple saja tapi cantik
tapi masalahnya sekarang sliding pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun
tak lah tingkap okay actually dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari supplier sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah lah
ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah already yang kan sudah
dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat tau dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja I bila kat dapur baru bunyi
sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar you tak bunuh dia sebab itu I cakap kena panggil
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot lah I cannot tahan already is
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like merajuk
you tahu macam merajuk perempuan ah okay lah okay lah apa
saya tipu lah saya tipu lah okay lah bye bye
emotional ah uncle itu
tak boleh lupa eh kelakar
okay whatever you call it ah ya that one also some already uh like uh apa itu
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already merepek right
maybe lah he want to save that way or what alamak then I regret seh sekarang menyesal seh tak pakai tiles yang kita pilih
dah bersusah payah kita pergi hafari lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi ya kan saja
itu lah dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak uh tak licin tak jatuh
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever pun so
habis uh nak kena plan nak kena
plan itu lagi budget lagi nak kena plan budget nanti you bilang I nanti I buatkan breakdown
kan so kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa kan toilet pun kita baru buat cuma maybe kalau tiles itu memang
tak bagus itu tukar saja lah sebab dia punya slope pun ingat tak kita kan suruh dia buat slope jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi
pun masih bertakung tau I cuci toilet pun I tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya slope dia
uh uh tapi yang macam accessories macam tempat mandi uh apa itu picit-picit nak cebok ah tu semua
uh boleh pakai balik ah so at least itu dah save cost sebab itu pun under dalam quotation juga
ah itu dah save cost lah lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah
kalau let's say ada budget untuk buat yang rumah punya pun actually perabot tak payah cuma kita just ambil gambar ah kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada
tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun considered
uh apa itu macam modern apa modern minimalist pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu kan senang sikit lah
mm modern juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak mm
lagi apa eh kita dah tukar eh
so far yang kat dalam toilet itu ya lah kan lampu uh ya so hopefully
mm tak ada lah sekarang plan dia is ini tak standard plan is one uh kitchen two toilet
sebab itu kalau you nak buat kitchen saja ini susah memang dia comes together so might as well buat saja
sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit you tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga K habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit then end up kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya kan
so kita betul-betul buat sekaligus lah lagi pun toilet
lagi pun uh bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah kan habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu ah
eh sekali terus habuk semua lah
ah betul
lagi bilik bilik aqi pun
mm bilik aqi pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang vinyl vinyl sahaja
dah berapa uh that time eight hundred kan lapan ratus vinyl sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini
kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu toilet itu semua nak kena
mm kalau kita buat balik lah
itu kan pintu toilet itu kan dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena nak kena
hack nak kena plaster balik
semua akan affected
tapi ini click function kan vinyl itu remember
tak boleh lah ini ini kena potong kena apa kena measure sembarang saja
entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi ha
tak boleh dah haus you tengok dia punya
dia punya tengok ini dah hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada gap lah dia dah ada jarang-jarang in between dia punya ini kayu
then how how because vinyl pun boleh kembang ikut uh panas atau sejuk tau bilik
ah dalam bertahun ah ini ini pun macam tak tukar ha ini dah kembang lah ini nampak line dia ada gap
lepas itu tak boleh ada gap itu hit itu lah dia dah ini merekah lah itu
uh uh eh ini tak bagus ini I think murah punya ini bukan yang vinyl tau ini yang
dia orang pandai kan eh
tak macam buruk sih go back to the old design then is like what's the point of creating the new design
but the Iphone eleven purple lagi cantik pe
ah I think tak ada discount kan
yeah just came back yesterday wah pergi sana bukan untuk service seh just is people really just go there for the pool

yeah I mean some of the requirements also I don't meet lah macam what ada kan diploma lah atau experience lah then I'm like I don't have any
uh I'm like it require three months aku tiga bulan dah start sekolah ape kalau gitu
eh I play with me I will download it and then boleh main sama-sama
I don't I I err boleh boleh tanya orang lain
oh err ada lah or
ya because they tengok a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try nak cuba
oh my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press dia punya butang after that he hide the body behind him
mm betul wah I miss playing night games with people
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO atau Among Us then I'm like
err all meat but I can still eat daging lembu yes
yeah because daging lembu selalu macam they have this smell
yeah yeah and then tak boleh tahan it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
I mean tak boleh predict pe so
yeah especially since err nanti the fish will macam bau ja hanyir so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
nak but then
bila nak pergi what's the plan
twenty eight agak near lah kena check again
okay yeah my poly friends also dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke they all already start uni
tak sekolah lain-lain seh
entah lah dia orang nak jumpa makan lah nak jumpa belajar then I'm like kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama
yeah then macam guys move on
that's why then I macam aiya whatever lah it's up to them then next week ah minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa then they were like oh kita tunggu untuk Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then eh I just open the chat habis tu I kan I just say mm err you guys go ahead I'm not free
then the makanan they all want to eat also selalu dia orang nak minta makanan I tak boleh makan
yeah cause dengan our secondary school friends kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu pe selalu it's very easy for us to settle food what
yeah then is don't know lah is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like oh let's eat Umisushi then okay aku tak boleh makan
yeah it's like oh let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet dengan dia orang it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like penat seh why did I go out I regret going out of the house
boleh experiment then you see mana satu lagi murah
uh yeah aigoo dah lah tak ada kerja habis tu bus fare pun mahal hais
oh I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey dia punya yeah
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems lah like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible punya bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
cause even for like macam orang yang tak boleh nampak like visual disability they have new apps macam the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
cause even for my school cause Ngee An kan ada that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability pun I there was this period of time I had like macam class right then every time if I reach school dekat this certain timing I will see that makcik that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
oh forest no tak dengar eh
wah was the forest fire macam bad
oh my gosh why apa gunanya gender reveal seriously
it's macam
pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
I guess maybe we have different values like untuk kita if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
wah ah speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she mm baked untuk your birthday wah I still think of it sometimes
yeah cause I mean I think the cake macam dry because dah simpan satu hari pe dah potong then you give it to them the next day but wah the whipped cream I was so amazed cause selalu whipped cream kan diorang buat cake is either macam banyak sangat then too sweet or like the whipping cream macam how to say ya macam berminyak is that the word like
yeah don't cause you messaged me habis tu you messaged dengan orang lain kan and we were like err dia tak kan beli cake kan like err err err
that's why when you asked me kalau nak cake then I like I like cake but kalau aku bilang aku nak cake nanti kau beli macam mana
no she panic cause yang when you were working together yang ada satu hari ni then after that kita send message then you pakai dia punya handphone kan then dia eh guys Nisha pakai aku punya handphone then we were like oh did she see the chat
yeah then we ni we panic right then kita tukar dia punya group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
yeah eh I can pinjam you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one kena bayar
it's it's super hilarious macam you you boleh nampak their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
err sekarang dah ada empat if you want to include macam behind the scenes ada lapan in total
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the cawan was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got cawan I was like
is is like your cup nya design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
right it's ugh and it's not very like macam merchandise is you
wah you know the only time yang diorang letak diorang punya muka right the I think is the merchandise I was like nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas
mm I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in punya bantal</malay lah dia punya soft toy then I like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the chibi the tiny Tan oh my god oh I wanted to get their things and then after that aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya shipping fee then I'm like
dia punya shipping macam boleh beli tiga dia punya product tau I was like ugh
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right dia punya shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
oh no no no that one change already cause that one is diorang punya old style
you want to level up untuk dapat lebih banyak benda you must do the quiz and fill up the test
tak dia this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
tapi bodoh lah just tak you spend like ape thirty dollars just to kacau orang on the website
well nak beli this macam sweater it's a knitted sweater lah then I also looking at this skirt
yeah err I think the skirt dalam dua belas dollar gitu
tak it's just I want to save up the money first
because the shipping is only macam dalam dua tiga dollar gitu aje not much
yeah cause macam it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse punya factory lah so yeah
dah boleh off
okay ah jadi in january
I aku tanya untuk early check in
aku kena jumpa kau pukul tiga kat bugis
mail confirmed datang ke tak
kita jumpa dia orang somewhere
then bila kita dah jumpa dia orang then baru kita macam
cari tempat makan ah I mean
I don't know aku tak tahu macam kau orang nak buat whether kau orang nak order from app sendiri sendiri atau kau orang nak beli then bring back
betul juga ah

tapi tu lah aku pun macam
untuk confirm
err actually semua belum confirm
it's err dayah actually dah confirm tapi pasal anak dia
kalau pasal anak dia jadi dia macam to be confirmed
kita macam so far so good lah kan
for dayah confirmed pasal man fetch dia then man datang ambil hantar
kira K the thing is dayah man akan ambil anak-anak dayah then ambil dia then hantar dia supposedly that was what I had in my head but dia cakap
oh anak aku pun datang abeh dia cakap aku tak biasa orang lain jaga anak aku so aku macam
macam you know that feeling ah macam
boleh lah tapi also mai mai pun pasal dia

ah eight nine apa we go on the eight so aku tak tahu macam mana how she will juggle it
like kerja
dengan kita ah but
I know that all of them nak join definitely like siapa yang tak nak budak primary school
problem tak I mean also at the same time beacause I did personally ask them
whether okay ke tak
macam abeh dia orang semua macam excited okay
then the anak thing
the anak thing came up then after everything is like
okay semua orang macam
tengok lah macam mana
I mean aku don't mind I I mean really
betul betul eh aku really don't mind tau kalau dia bawa anak dia
but it's attitude anak dia yang buat aku macam
tu yang buat aku marah gila tau bila the first time aku nampak that kind of attitude and she even say um dah dah ada rumah dah pindah semua perangai tak nak dengar kata aku
dia macam cakap out loud tau macam you know how mothers are like ah aku seorang kat rumah ni
ah aku seorang jer kemas orang lain ah macam gitu dia macam rant
why suddenly the change then dia macam aku pun tak tahu ah semua orang macam perangai
you know you are expecting guests you you already have guests yesterday abeh ini hari aku dengan cousin man datang
to your child and ask macam
kau okay tak
why are you behaving like this abeh macam dia
aku tak tahu ah like really aku aku tak nak malukan dia
aku tak nak dia kita malukan dia like
so aku macam you know
as fake as it is ah aku macam nak try everything to go smoothly tau aku tak nak nanti macam
I mean this will happen ah orang macam
why I come here oi kau eh kau duduk eh alamak standard mothers I I expect that even wati is like
aku tak tahu whether aku bawa anak aku pasal nanti aku tarzan and anak dia perempuan
kau tak tutup pintu eh tadi
okay I take the fault so mojo boleh keluar tak
takde dia nak tengok muka aku juga macam gitu gasak lah kau
okay but apa
so I was thinking aku fikir kan nak macam if we're getting together aku nak order mango tart
dari kawan aku lah but she say she can for weekday she can only do delivery seven thirty onwards
then aku macam okay ah I don't mind
then but at the same time bugis banyak dessert though
dia banyak dessert
so aku macam is it worth it ordering from my friend
err siapa
dia kahwin dia kahwin dah pregnant dah ada anak then she was like posting about anak dia then after that stopped
like anak dia
kan macam out of the blue stopped so aku pun macam oh okay lah
sebab tu lah
dia okay ke tak
that's that's why bila aku tanya dia kan aku macam mm should I ask should I ask
pasal aku tak tahu whether
she is into getting together with us meeting up with us ke tak
aku nak tutup aku tutup pintu jap just in case mister mojo masuk
eh busy kau
kau dah bilang dia lah
oh nanti lah aku tengok aku check kan kalau ada lagi ni pun aku nampak kat facebook lah sia
aku nampak tapi aku macam okay I sent in my interest then dia get back to aku then dia cakap but actually boleh send anytime
actually boleh send anytime
then aku macam tengok lah macam mana pasal err dia cakap slots are filling up fast
so aku cakap dengan dia aku boleh buat on friday which is dengan kau lah there is no way I'm doing with someone else
cause abeh dia cakap pun dia boleh dapatkan orang
tak nak aku I'm not I'm not in school to do that
aku pun aku zoom sekali jer
sekali jer
kau insurance apa ah
ada rider
no ride rider means it's an extra premium jadi kau boleh dapat macam
um that is a um macam
macam mana eh nak cakap kau boleh
kira kan
private hospital macam hospital aku
ya but it's still macam subject to approval ah
but insurance kau kau dapat bila
so shouldn't be a but it's not a pre existing condition apa
two thousand fourteen kira lepas kau kahwin baru ada insurance
oh before asal kau tak ambil rider sekali
recently aku check untuk siapa si
ah dia ada rider anak dia ada rider just anak bongsu dia takde
but maybe it might be some aku can check lah what is your
ya I know it's shield something aku tak ingat ah nama dia
the words juga
kan macam ah is healthshield gold max A then there is also gold max B
ah A paling tinggi B macam down ah
kalau kau boleh check
I mean you can always ask lah bcause sometimes a lot of banyak orang kan kat kerja aku bila aku buat dia orang punya how to say ah
banyak anak seh tak tahu mak bapa dia orang punya insurance apa
macam ah I'll ask your parents got insurance
oh I don't know I don't know semua kau tak tahu apa yang kau tahu
macam these kind of things especially mak bapa kau dah tua
then aku macam
apa yang kau bayar untuk insurance macam kalau let's say ah the basic ah is medishield then kalau kau upgrade and then it will be depend on which company you take ah your prushield
then kalau tak upgrade baru kau tahu but then bila kau upgrade poly kau nak kena tahu whether kau punya is
atas atau somewhere in between macam parents aku punya is just one step below which is B plus is the
rider plan A plus is like not basic ah but it's there so macam
like dia orang kalau pergi private eh so kira macam emergency dia orang kena pergi private they have to pay upfront first
then reimbursement ah so that's why aku selalu cakap dengan members members eh
kau orang muda kau orang boleh afford it why not
memang betul lah kau macam kau tengok macam payah kau nak bayar
yearly kau bayar berapa when you count
macam kau even it out for twelve months
it's sikit seh it's like forty dollars fifty dollars unless you pay like over thousand over dollars ah then
TAQWA apa seh
itu apa islamic punya apa
tapi kan
asal hospital aku takde
pasal I mean
prudential aviva so ni empat jer tau most probably kalau ah qing were to come right she will have to pay first then reimburse
ya so that's how it is lah macam dia dapat refund balik ah kalau
kita boleh try to get electronic letter of guarantee which mean that without deposit so means kau tak payah bayar upfront
ah ah because that's why unless you don't I mean that's why I asked you whether kau private ke
private atau government for your future baby
oh okay lah government you don't have to worry macam kawan aku zahirah
three K dia keluar cash money
aku rasa they have a very big subsidiary for future mums
ah because they menggalakkan untuk kau mengadakan baby dan breastfeed
ya they they are really big on that seh they will get dia sampai dapat apa tu nursing
like if the baby doesn't latch on then dia cakap okay you try this you try that
but tapi bayar lah
oh that time kakak ipar aku punya tak seh
eva tak seh
tak tau pasal dia nak compete dengan private banyak orang pergi private because of that but at the same time people go to private because it's much more efficient much more faster
because of lesser clientele macam zahirah punya kakak ipar
she was like oh aku tak datang period
that time dia pergi hospital dia macam okay this is my err
macam oh I already have two kids I should be okay pergi then dia cakap oh you have a mass
macam a cyst a cyst a tumour or whatever need to remove so dia macam hati tak sedap dia pergi doctor aziz
dia orang ultrasound ah that's why tu pasal dia macam okay whatever I just spend a bit more money just for private
and anak dia semua doctor aziz
this doctor aziz apparently ada berapa sebelas anak
that's what I heard dari makcik aku pasal makcik aku ni ah pun doctor aziz juga
for bidan punya type ah for a gynaecologist tapi aku macam
sebelas sia ramai sia tu anak
tu pasal but dia orang cakap anak dia paling kecil is quite young
I don't know maybe dia masih nak kena tanggung for sekolah
oh pasal oh pasal kau
but takkan lah dia orang takde macam one certain doctor with your condition like this
but aku macam aku pun nak tengok gynae actually aku I I only have one month left sia for me to check for pap smear under my
uh kerjanya insurance
but aku nak kena pergi A&E nak kena dia orang check then after that you need to give some
bedek bedek then in order for you to see a gynae then after that tell them to give me pap smear
ah terus aku macam huh because if kalau aku pergi straight aku kena bayar out of pocket aku tak boleh pakai kerja punya insurance so aku macam mm
is it worth the ten the fifteen dollars pasal five dollars A&E ten dollars specialist
eh abeh nanti the baby macam mana ni
aku kena tolak tepi alah tak kisah pun
macam tak biasa you tahu kan semua alah aku pregnant
dua pregnant semua dah jadi mak
tak aku pun tanya no like aku pun macam
because it's been quite a while apa
ah kau dah ada eh
oh baru juga lah
wow kau punya
tu pasal lah because I know that they said when people go for radiation and this
a that's why banyak cancer male ah they freeze their sperm
ah just for future ah just in case dia orang nak anak then
then aku macam
mahal eh recently there was this guy I don't know what he did sperm extraction
tapi dia punya procedure dah dia dah
kerek procedure dia punya lah panjang mahal nak mampus sia
ah ah patient patient patientnya dia um
abeh macam angmoh
uh dia dia punya wife cina ah ah seh
kerek kerek gila terus aku macam aku tengok then I googled what was because whenever they give us
it's scientific apa
so aku google scientific word ni
rupanya it's sperm extraction for freezing eh hello umur dah berapa tak payah nak ada anak-anak ni semua macam abeh and also because dia orang dia cakap kat situ diagnosis low sperm count
low sperm count apa maknanya makna kau tak sepatutnya ada anak setan
I would I just want to know how much is the price that's all you don't have to you don't have to explain to me anything else diam ah sia
tapi kalau no the thing is kalau kita tak explain
macam dia tak cakap apa-apa aku tak tahu dia tak cakap ah abeh last last kena kat aku ah kepala otak dia
ya I'm there's a lot of times ah orang datang kat kita why is the doctor's charges so high
aiya I don't want to pay kau punya pasal ah kau tak nak bayar sudah
entah ah dah aku kena call sana call sini abeh last last clinic macam
ah abeh aku macam okay then you speak to the you speak to the patient ah
haiya this one okay okay okay okay eh kau tak happy aku tak happy semua tak happy siapa yang happy
bodoh abeh mana aku nak dapat duit aku kalau patient ni kalau patient ni tak bayar

abeh bomoh tu cakap kau nak anak kau hidup balik boleh tapi aku nak kena sacrifice lagi satu anak bodoh kan so aku macam abeh bila aku tengah tengok kau nak tahu apa dalam otak aku
agaknya anak dia kena sacrifice untuk orang lain punya anak so aku macam

pasal err
dia orang try to ikat
aku tak tahu police ni datang dari mana pasal tak ada orang call police entah entah police ada
kan macam
police ni datang dari mana ni
takde orang call kau seh pasal it's mak bapa dia jer dengan budak tu abeh budak tu bunuh bapak dia pasal dah
a'ah dia bapa dia abeh bini dia the mama pukul dah dia cakap muka dia dah berubah semua mak dia pukul sekali mak dia

then afterwards sekali dah dah nak ikat

abeh mak dia kena masuk jail kena duduk kat jail sia
kesian siol
ah aku tak faham asal orang macam gini like there's some people who really like macam so obsessed over
anak dia to a point that dia sanggup buat macam gini kau faham tak budak tu pun kena culik
aku tak pernah tengok sia tu
and it's lepas tu second rider pergi kat sana balik dah orang lain kan
tapi kan bila dia cakap macam gitu ada darah semua teringat aku pasal steven lim
ah adrian lim kesian seh
tak ah
tapi bila aku baca aku macam confused
pasal dia ambil budak tu dari clementi seh
aku tak tahu budak tu tinggal mana tapi dia pergi clementi untuk dengan makcik dia macam main-main kat bawah block
then entah entah dia kena bunuh kat toa payoh jauh tu
tapi yang ada lagi satu victim tu yang dia dapat lari eh oh tak it's a budak melayu tu kan yang dapat lari eh
ni aku sikit hari apa ah few years back ah abang aku tanya aku
ah googlekan adrian lim terus macam
kau ada smartphone apa
tapi internet dulu kan berapa ah
so aku macam oh okay I google for you abeh dia cakap block apa ah block ni ni ni aku tak ingat aku tak ingat block apa ah terus aku macam
why you want to know no why you find hantu ah
then macam tak ah okay lor okay lor
but nowadays macam banyak cerita hantu hantu
but tu dia sacrifice ah
tapi kau tengok ah muka dia macam babi sia
tapi kau dah tengok kau dah baca a son of peach punya yang
aku that time aku baca then tak tahu macam mana mona fandey boleh masuk
mona fandey punya stories pun boleh masuk juga terus aku macam
dia orang cakap mona fandey ni apa uh
err oh lately dia punya kawan perempuan err did something for drugs ah dekat malaysia abeh dia kena gantung tapi sebelum dia kena gantung dia duduk dekat mona fandey punya cell lama
every night dia kena kacau
abeh ada orang macam come to defense ah cakap oh dia macam dia kena fitnah seh
dia kena fitnah pasal dia sembahyang lima waktu then son of peach cakap kau fikir kau jaga barang ni semua tak senang ke of course kau nak kena sembahyang lima waktu seh kalau tak benda ni makan kau
ah so that's why you want like keep your iman
strong at the same time you want to practise all these terus aku macam
ah jadi dia
tak macam selama ni dia tahu macam black magic ni kau pun nak kena sembahyang lima waktu jadi benda-benda ni semua tak kacau kau
tapi at the same time kan aku tak rasa dia ada black magic
that ilmu kebal
aku tak tahu lah macam dia punya intention to just pakai duit sidek ni
pakai duit yang siapa ni yang mati ni then bila dia bunuh then dia just pakai jer pasal she had no intention of covering it up apa
so aku rasa macam maybe the intention is just to buat pakai duit ni bunuh
then on the disguise of ada ilmu kebal
mm but at the same time dia ada practice dia macam small time small time jer lah tapi
macam orang yang kat quaters dekat
malaysia punya
aku macam oh my god oh my god
abeh bila aku kerja kat kan aku punya colleague cakap apa tau eh kau tahu mona fandey oh tahu tahu asal asal kau nampak dia aku nampak satu makcik ni macam dia pakai kebaya semua
ah kau tahu bila dia pergi court kan dia pakai kebaya dia cakap ah makcik ni macam dia dekat harbourfront terus aku cakap mona fandey dah sampai singapore
apa ni mona fandey sampai singapore
imagine sekali satu hari kau pass by kau nampak mona fandey
oh atau orang macam mona fandey aku pekik lah sial
tu lah tapi
kan ah dia orang cakap yang kat quarters ni dia orang cakap ah dia macam selalu asal cepat sangat asal cepat sangat macam from three to six dia orang akan nampak
pasal dia nak kena gantung lepas subuh apa so dia macam alamak asal cepat sangat ni dia cakap jangan cepat sangat lah tu macam ee seramnya aku
tapi siapa yang duduk cell dia akan kena gantung
ah pasal aku rasa cell dia it's just for those yang akan kena gantung nanti aku macam mm and recently kakak ipar aku pun macam dia kakak ipar aku sekolah kan
so dia tanya
sometimes people who banyak orang kena gantung
macam pasal singapore punya amount for hanging is quite high
eh it's quite low kalau macam kau five gram jer kau dah boleh kena gantung padahal tu five gram is cukup untuk kau pakai sendiri then aku macam
banyak melayu kena gantung seh yang kena gantung melayu
mostly malays yang si cina ni semua dapat
so aku macam it's it's already like lah where
apa heavy
tapi kakak kakak ipar aku pun berbual pasal dia kerja kat dalam kan dia pun ada cakap kau tengok ah yang si cina-cina ni semua blue collar sia eh cina-cina semua white collar crime crimes sia and duit dia orang banyak-banyak kau orang punya duit sikit-sikit duduk berapa lama
kakak ipar aku cakap think of it ah look at it
and also dia pun tak tahu ah macam how she feels about the death penalty I mean kalau betul-betul pada aku macam orang yang patut kena bunuh is rapist kena hang ni yang rapists child molesters they should be hanged but apparently dia orang kena serve time then after that they come out mana boleh
pada aku rotan tak cukup sia bro
ah rotan dua empat kali pun tak cukup
atau jadikan subject of experiments
but there's human rights lah so aku macam whatever lah this people are not humans
entah because I think dulu kan dia orang fikir macam the drugs can ruin our children our future
that was their thinking lah so aku macam
ni semua sia dia orang patut they should actually look into it seh
drugs but I'm like pada aku macam
kau sedar macam it's like
a human life memang betul lah both of them play with human lives but then
kau kentut eh
these rape victims may not be macam
they are alive ah but dia traumatised for life
and badan dia orang rabak seh
and badan dia orang may change macam rabak like what if they get pregnant from the rapists like eh jangan bodoh ah
ah boleh makan dalam ah mm
but aku tak tahu dia orang ni semua macam mana
then aku macam
about the human life who have ruined another human like a lot of these drug not drug traffickers I'm not saying about drug traffickers lah banyak dia orang makan sendiri like they use it for their own consumption they are not selling
but kalau kau tengok dia punya amount is not macam lima
aku ada ah ni satu case kat yishun yang pakcik ya uncle lah
ya takde pun hanging
ah tak
entah lah dok
ni semua politic politic ni politic
and also they live up to the stereotype juga lah
macam kat geylang that time aku yana aku tengok asal dia ni macam weird aku dah mata dah tak nampak sangat tangan ada gam
tangan ada gam meleleh-leleh bodoh betul
semua orang sia aku tak tahu bila abang aku masuk pun kita semua macam kita adik-beradik macam tahu lah
but that one point of time bila dia gaduh dengan fizah tu part yang dia kena angkat terus
whatever tu pasal aku cakap maybe right maybe he's a drug user that's why you cannot

aku tak nak contact dengan dia
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared

that's all and then the next the next message he sent me was I think like two days ago and he said like hey I know this is weird but can I ask you for a favour then aku macam seram sejuk tau aku macam what favour sia this fellow want to ask
ya like now apa they don't even play music there
only now because now all the social distancing people like go there and like check like if you want to lepak at the beach also
so like when he tell me he want to like ask me for this favour like a part of me was like a a little bit like macam
vindicative so I was like sure even if you get the place kat dalam otak aku ah aku fikir you want to get the place tutup mm it not gonna be fun ya
makan cake

like a kid like he hold out the hand habis badan aku kat atas tangan dia and even then I was freaking out I was like no cannot then he was like babe why are you scared my hands are right here how are we going to travel ha and then go swimming and all these nice places I'm like um I'll I'll swim in the shallow waters

I also cannot like panas sial only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay lah he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun kan but I cannot like the bed very comfortable lah then I just go back to sleep

kita kena fikir tau tiga orang nak tidur kita kena tidur macam gini melintang

kau takde kau benda-benda gini kan ada
abang kau lagi lah
aku rasa macam abang aku ada nanti aku tengok eh kalau ada
tapi sleeping bag eh tapi kita tiga orang aku rasa aku minta
tak okay katil
that was you you are being told to sleep there kita takkan suruh kau tidur situ the three of us sleep on the bed but if let's say the bed is a king besar right then we
we tidur macam
macam mana uh kita tidur melintang
means kita tak kita tak tak ikut cara
boleh eh aku pernah buat aku nenek aku dan kakak aku pergi holiday kita
kau jangan aku tak suruh kau tidur dekat bench aiyo
a'ah betul tak payah fikir banyak-banyak eh
actually aku tak tahu kau cakap apa tadi aku cakap jer
tapi tapi tu kau kena bawa as in the hassle is we have to be
okay I I think you can get at nanti aku tag but I don't know when I'm going
maybe Daiso punya is for
oh because I know that it the trend is macam you know like like baru-baru ni ah orang baru nak cycling
ni pasal ah
okay lah ini semua pasal COVID lah orang semua
cari cari apa kegiatan eh
kegiatan eh
ah riadah seh
eh uh apa tu ah next year ah we do something
actually I'm supposed to go out just now to collect something then I tell the person can I come tomorrow instead cause like I saw the it's scorching hot then I was like ah apa aku boleh buat productive hari ni okay kemas bilik
tak sweater lah this is this is not sweater this is
no it's tak tebal it is tak tebal
like that thing anak luar nikah jer
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen pasal ada anak
wow there's a lot of way way sia macam
okay dalam segi agama I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing lah like just to settle down like err apa to prevent like any sins or any like um what does it call
no no mm haram and thing and like macam um uh what is it macam the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
so macam apa ya
honestly no ah because like nanti macam ingat kau macam main main
like you think what this one main main is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back merepek what
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like ah I've heard lah stories macam aku nampak yang they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya islam
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia ah malaysia ku entah leh maybe it's normal maybe is not lah but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like err what is restu
ah ah they give restu ah they give I the blessing ah dorang kasih blessing dorang
then it's like wow like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage ah for parents nak kasih restu like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind lah kan
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like tak sabar
they just want to like so macam like oh
if I get married oh you know everything will be like halal you know macam ni ni ni ni like actually ah he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like macam
so if later macam if it's just reflects to the people and there's like oh kau tengah stereotype just because I'm young
for me ah okay ah kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu ah because like I think I I really believe yang macam apa ya love does not apa ya time does not define love ke love does not define time ada kat that thing ah
like kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one ah because like I heard stories like my apa apanya cikgu
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school sampai ke tua like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around
like macam he he wasn't serious he still don't want to get married
no no not not the other chicks lah like macam he's just not ready for marriage dia tak dia tak belum fikir kan lah okay for my cikgu kan she's like okay let's say lepak ah ya
okay the guy likes to lepak jam beberapa jam ke dua tiga pagi tau just lepak bawa blok berbual-bual rokok tu semua right my teacher is like by eleven is like eh aku tak penat jah like I want to go home I want to sleep like so like that ya so macam they they I think it's like eight years' relationship
ya ya they call it off they dia orang tak tunang pun ya they broke up she broke up with him and then after that err kak got to know
find new people think she dated one I think like less than a year and I saw she tunang and then after that a year after that she got married ya ya
ya that's the thing like actually I was shocked that she she like she was okay lah maybe dia ada rasa sedih lah I mean siapa tak rasa sedih kan kalau break up
but she's like you know what this is not what I want like like she knows what she wants tu aku yang jawab aku respect kau ah
you really follow me ah eh kalau ikutkan hati aku
I mean like I've been single for the longest time for so macam like
you know you just gonna get any guy then kalau like kau okay aku okay kita go ah sia
but then it's like okay let's say kau
kau dengan my dear kau berapa lama
boleh but then you think your parents will agree
oh tak boleh sambung uh huh
ya I think I've heard stories like they they they just like marry by paper but they still macam go on lah macam I think they are like schooling or something macam let's say kes kalau ni ah
from there ah then masuk like okay lah slowly perlahan perlahan kayuh ah
society nya sekarang now is like I think apa ever since okay let's say our generation ah eh like okay let's say my after our parents' generation like maybe the like early nineties or like the late eighties all of them run dusted the career minded path semua yang tak nak kahwin pun
mm like angkat kaki hurry I already late for work
and then lepas tu macam like complain bila jam
eh amboi
oh I thought like actually yang aku akan like will go itu I thought like people would really go to because like we like

some medications dorang cakap is mahal gila some I think it's like affordable
apa tu suburbs

lepas tu like because of that apparently china ban the movie that's what I heard from my friend that's what I heard from my friend they say like err ban in china that's why like it's very accessible on the website lah so I watch it on website lah

satu location tu yang kita suka pergi tu was the P ramlee ah
the P ramlee dia originally from apa orang penang kan
ah so tempat dia very so called macam museum lah macam museum
macam berapa tahu lah didn't didn't know that much about err apa this rumah P ramlee ni
and and obviously dia punya apa the driver was a eh is a is a indian guy
so dia pun tak tahu macam kalau orang local melayu ah different lah
mungkin kita pun macam macam so keen gitu kan
ah nampak you pun gaya macam P ramlee gitu ah no kita kita
dia orang tua so kita macam kita respect
orang tu pun nak bercerita kan so kita macam ah okay lah we we we
he he talk to us kita mesti reciprocate lah jangan macam oh kita sombong kan tidak
ah orang tu berbual pasal P ramlee orang dia macam gini I think dia dia dia apa pernah jumpa P ramlee lah
mana oh dia kawan um mm
so okay macam we had fun there then kita pergi yang apa tu yang yang the
ah tapi dalam gambar the tower tu macam bridge dia ah you can actually see
ah is a apa is a see through transparent punya transparent punya tower ah kita ingat berapa panjang lah dia punya tower
jambatan tu apa bang is a bridge ah bridge ah
so kita oh dalam kita pun yang technology apa kita kita Google lah kita check oh you must go here
sekali ah tapi raja dia tu takut eh dia takut height
member security apa badan
tough gila tapi takut height okay lah
tapi pergi sana jer eh eh
senonek jer macam it's not that just a just a half a circle macam okay lah tapi kita pun
nak kalau nak ambil gambar mesti tahu the right angle so kalau kalau you
you ambil gambar the right angle orang cakap wah dia ni naik
macam apa macam bagus gitu lah tapi it's very small lah
tapi you kena pakai ni you have to wear macam protection punya apa
ah macam so called covered our shoe tu kan
ah and of course lah obviously you tak boleh apa
ah macam hentak-hentak lah kan
tapi yang kita disappointment tu pasal kita tak boleh pergi naik apa tu the famous cable car
itu we were hoping pasal banjir kan so tutup because ada land slide
bukit bendera the punya famous ah
cable car kalau you datang penang you mesti naik tu ah but
kita we apa tried tapi dia punya attraction tutup kan pasal land slide so we we cannot go
ah so okay lah macam itu macam really disappointed tapi kita dah like I said kita pergi pun terjun botol kan
kita tak tahu apa-apa ah whether masih banjir because on the news totally ah almost tiap-tiap hari kita tengok news
banjir dia dah dah surut ke belum macam we were hoping ah
tapi the thing ya lah kalau let's say kita cancel but there is no travelling restriction we don't get back
kalau macam let's say ah the the minister ah okay no restriction tak boleh pergi penang ah then yes
son kalau topic dengan berbual dengan driver pun one of it is ah apa cakap pasal apa banjir itu lah
a'ah kalau tidak dia kena pergi macam go longer way lah longer route
conserving atau err uh
and one of the attraction kita pergi ah yang apa the apa terbalik tu apa bang
upside down museum itu kalau orang pergi pun mesti because eh
err penang tu like I said dia punya attraction dia tu tak banyak dia punya attractions tu bukit bendera tu so kalau ah I think kalau dia punya other attractions macam all sorts of museum lah dorang buat ada yang macam cup apa
food ah food museum lah upside down museum ada three three three D museum three D museum so kita pergi I think about kita pergi dua ya bang kan kita pergi dua museum tapi yang upside down tu bagus
ada juga ah
kita dapat seratus eh seratus
tapi sana bayaran dia dalam malaysia ringgit bang sini singapore dollar so kat sana pun kalau dorang
charge apa ah apa empat puluh ringit kan bagi kita ah just about
lain cerita lah kan kalau let's say kat sana pun kita kalau beli makan pun in ringgit you know macam alah jangan cakap lah apa rindu lah dengan apa malaysia ada kat sana ah
betul ah
kita family of four ah
can be found ye lah
ah bosan kita tiga orang aja um kita ye lah apa ah apa
kita tengok kita dengar dari news kan oh there's no apa ah zero no new cases no local new cases kita macam harap-harap just make it zero lah make it zero make it zero kan
then kalau macam tempat locations oh dekat sini ada apa visited by COVID nineteen
so we try to avoid lah that that place tapi kalau sometimes it's unavoidable
tu pun tak boleh juga kan macam eh hari tu ada kat ion hotel ah ion orchard hotel ah ah orchard shopping centre
kita pergi sana kan tapi kena ikhtiar lah
what what we can do is that like I say we are wearing mask is one of the protection so kita dengan ni kita good hygiene dah mesti dah mesti instill in you already
ah so let's say kita pakai apa pakai hand sanitiser
okay then ada disposable bag
dua puluh dua puluh satu dua puluh satu tu ah memang apa harapan banyak lah dalam apa dua puluh dua puluh satu
bukan only bukan only financially financially memang itu kalau orang dekat singapore ni mesti
hopefully ah apa naik gaji naik pangkat
okay lah but you know we have to be realistic ah kan sekarang ni kita like I say still in a pandemic situation kan
secara tak langsung kita nak ah apa increase kita punya ah
number of children family members ah tu yang kita target lah inshallah kalau ni in dua puluh dua puluh satu kan ah
ah if everything goes smoothly and the planning is semua betul inshallah then we can apa
have a try another one doesn't matter lah like I said it's a boy or girl twins ke apa ke you know semuanya datang dari dia kita terima lah
tapi tapi kita mesti ada satu kepala lah
kan kalau let's say kalau you ada
you punya vision you tu oh macam gini gini tapi kalau macam orang keliling you tak cooperate tak ada kasi kerjasama akan pengsan juga bang ah so it's like you know kalau you know kalau your vision must be clear ah kalau let's say
tak munasabah tak adil ah macam you you apa
kalau let's say dia dia tak nak ikut kita punya apa perancangan kita cara kita tapi kalau ada masalah jer oh fall back ah datang balik pada you eh kau tolongkan aku gini kan tak boleh lah gitu macam bagi
bagi I ye lah macam you you ni apa kepala keluarga eh kan ah tapi jangan lupa isteri pun ada peranan dia kan isteri dia ialah dian punya neck neck tu apa bang
ah leher pada apa ah
ya lah ya lah so ya lah itu then then then
ah apa kawan-kawan apa relative lain tu anak kita adik kan dia is part of the body lah kan itu akan jadi seorang orang lah kan
special eh tapi you think
ah tahun twenty twenty one dia boleh macam
kita punya kes tu dia boleh move forward tak macam kita boleh apa dapat sekolah ke
semua no semua macam hiccup dia it comes from this pandemic kita nak pergi apa
nak pergi ah check up for him pun eh restricted tapi pasal apa
ye lah pasal dia orang special kan lepas tu dia ada apa ada epilepsy
so perlukan apa ah ubat then kalau pergi doctor doctor health check pun you you sorang pun tak boleh you kena minta bantuan dari you punya cousin
which she she help a lot lah kan tentang pasal apa adik
kan tapi kalau macam pasal sekolah ni pasal this pandemic semua macam tergantung tau macam nak dapat sekolah tak ada betul tempat ah
and they are not the the the badan you you you are actually you are talking to so many badan pasal your adik kan
badan apa pasal autistic pasal ni
but but they are not communicating with each other macam but here we are we are waiting have you talk to this this uh
this organisation but this organisation haven't got back to you macam mana ni kan kita yang
tapi nak tengok dia punya medical check up dia tu
macam endless tau macam tak ada habis macam bagi bagi you you dah pergi medical care kan hari tu kan dah pergi ni dia nak this badan ni dia nak lagi satu kali punya round punya medical check up
nak jumpa lagi ah
ah betul lah
okay the thing is macam pergi check up ni okay lah tapi
kita nak bawa adik kan orang dia tu orang badan besar tapi dia ada epilepsy kita tak tahu bila-bila masa dia boleh jatuh boleh rebah
kan so dia punya dia punya keselamatan tu yang yang kita worry lah risiko there ah
ah lah and different authorised doctors yang boleh certified ah
mm betul
kita kita nak dapat report
dari satu doctor ni kau boleh tuliskan tak untuk adik aku punya ni
mungkin kalau let's say we go for this macam
phase three kelonggaran kan macam tak apa
apa boleh sekolah pun boleh admit more
more students kan untuk adik kan
pada I itu lah macam apa
kita hopeful hopeful lah kan
ah adik dapat pergi sekolah dapat apa dapat belajar lah bukan macam
kita bukan harap dia oh jadi dia jadi pandai ke boleh pergi kerja tidak kita nak dia improve
ah improve in dia macam ada itu purpose tau purpose in life
ah walaupun dia orang yang orang yang special orang autistic
tapi macam you know basic ah basic needs boleh makan sendiri ah
ah pandai macam ah
bukan apa macam simple
ni pun dia tahu dia suka keluar kan
ah sekarang dia pun minta pakai selipar pakai selipar nak jalan jalan so macam
kan daripada dia macam terperuk dekat rumah jer kan macam dia nak ah apa dia nak
ah tengok apa apa pemandangan kan kalau sharif main apa
pun kasi dia fresh air lah kan jangan terperuk dekat rumah jer
you lah ataupun you punya cousin ah
ah tolong
mm ubat dia tu pun kena kasi makan dua kali satu hari kan
ah dengan pemakanan yang bagus lah
kan kau tak boleh kasi makan oh makan maggi jer ke kan atau makan bubur jer like I said dia tu
kan so kita kalau kasi makan pun macam mana tiga puluh satu tahun lelaki
kan dia mesti perlukan staple food nasi
ah dia perlu ayam daging kan itu yang dia perlu makan
ah ye lah and and mesti mesti perlu kasi sayur-sayuran
kan vegetables is very important walaupun put salt
apa form lah potato ke
apa cendawan mushroom kan that also
plays a part kita masuk dalam kita punya wah sekarang dah pandai masak kan
the food inside jadi lah kasi adik makan kan
mm walaupun dia special ah ah istimewa
adik punya apa
autism ni pun bukan yang ada apa yang ganas yang pukul
kita YouTube kan kita tengok orang ada lebih teruk lagi daripada adik tapi adik
alhamdulillah dia orang dia macam kalau kita suruh dia buat dia buat
ah kan mungkin ada yang
time yang dia tak apa tak dengar lah who's perfect kan tapi tidak
kita punya semua kita punya goals semua dapat kita capai lah
kan maybe adik dapat sekolah
ah dapat duit lebih banyak kan gaji
naik lah inshallah
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe entah bah
wait wait wait so kirakan like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like err
ya we top we we top the rank ah isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases tu lah pasti
but by that time um we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like kita pergi Bangkok for like satu minggu holiday
even though like you know there were threats of um like you know this unknown virus being spread around lah tapi
we went to Japan habis habis lepas tu was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal
dia pakai dia the kind macam dia pakai mask
habis like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a uh metal tube with like hundreds of um other people like he will refuse to wear dia punya mask and I'm like
aku tak faham so anyway
sorry so ya begitu lah but ya then after that it's like err
uh they took unpaid leave and then after that err I I I tanya dia orang lah like eh so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on err what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then dorang cakap macam eh kau lucky sia kau um um you left at a very good time and then I'm like
but ya macam begitu ah and err like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
you do you remember that um the viral video that fiasco the whole Ateeqah Mazlan punya benda that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like macam padanlah muka dia
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up siapa is it or something is it I can't remember
ya habis tu apa macam like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them dia macam nak dia berniat nak
dia I think I think her niat is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place um apa eh
uh like the current regulations that are in place mm related to home based business begitu
tak satisfy is like an understatement because dorang I mean like you know like melayu punya backlash is like next level dorang macam like oh err
err dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup
kan as in what do they say uh they said something about like err nak tutupkan err nak kacau periuk ah
periuk nasi orang something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi so funny
okay I did not think that it was our good friend Hadi pasal si
of course lah I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID eh sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan kan
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum macam frus
dia orang masih kerja like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than uh more than ever and like
it's still a kerja ah kerja tu kerja lah but like you know
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some macam
the apa tu barang barang for the err how do you say the the items for the supermarket kan
how how long is that show two hours is like dua jam I don't think you can like squeeze everything together lah
highly taxing job for example kan macam like in a family a a low income family of like for example dia punya anak dia err anak dia special needs kid
habis lepas tu the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older habis dorang tak ada they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
people who are like who are eligible for like macam help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular um like income ceiling for example and then after that like macam err
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like macam you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so macam I guess
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like err because err apa
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very leceh pasal like you know because
there were at least macam twenty people in the class then after that like err we
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so macam kita very move very FOMO
and this was the very funny part so kita orang punya exams we  kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one eh apa eh
we were revising and basically we were revising based on err what the exam usually entails lah macam like
like like ada ada open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
err so that time nak like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working ah
uh there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book tapi kita orang macam like
eh get real lah kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan you know go on Whatsapp lepas tu kita text eh kau tahu tak what's this what's the answer for this but in
so it's like um basically we were err there are there are like three different kinds of exam so macam like open task
so macam like we get on we we all got go online lepas tu we all sit down together
buka tu link duduk for two hours ku duduk situ
kau buat tu err exam just like a normal exam tapi err ni in the comfort of your own home  begitu
well nothing because okay for that macam the time exam kan the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like ada forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
ha you memang betik
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people habis lepas tu like now err bila I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now pasal like err how to say this like um I'm much older than I was obviously
dia pandai tahu dia pandai she graduated from mass comm eh no she graduated from advertising
Ngee Ann similar course tapi dia punya dia punya
distracted tak tak boleh tahan so I had a project before just like macam like maybe two weeks ago ya so dia sibuk dengan dia punya boyfriend punya birthday
habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam you know it's a group work
so nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk and then discuss lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa in a powerpoint
presentation nak kena prepare pasal kita orang ada presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that kita kena buat like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
I said to her okay you know what aku buat aku buat yang lit review punya part lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like macam kita orang punya um information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report itu pun dia tak boleh buat
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so dia boleh
dia boleh lah pergi mana mana like dia punya boyfriend dia punya twenty third birthday dia pergi prepare all the apa tu
gifts for him bagai can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
because is like even though when I was working tak ada chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
itu part time just
we are online uh we doing online lessons right now kan so like half the time kita
um kita log-on like at 9 o'clock
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and leceh gila then I was like err
tak nak ah malas ah but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks um
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that duduk dekat atas meja lah and do my work
this semester so I macam like to be able to connect with them in a level err I mean like online everything is very cool
as in this particular Food Panda thing dia punya promo jer daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja as in like err
entah lah
ha apa
kita boleh pergi pe Sentosa island or like pulau ubin ke pulau hantu ke like our friend went to pulau hantu what recently
itu itu next level I was
kejap now is like almost two o'clock ya I what's what's classes what are classes
eh thirty plus dollars compared to my twenty five thousand dollars is nothing okay diam sudah diam
no tak payah lah just stop jer
I don't know ugh I I don't have access to the the Whatsapp right now kejap eh
and then she jeling at me
it's called sekali gus
ya because if a goose goes out and buy things and carry everything in one trip it's called sekali gus
I have never seen where mister teh tarik is at jurong
like banyak banyak
that one thing you did lunch time right banyak banyak kan
it's still rezeki
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one lah down there right and then after that rina uh uh recently only um enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then nak kena go and study
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing lah but you think hanisah is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not lah but it's not worth it I think it's very bodoh
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no what
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know itu pun so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread macam roti
a'ah during that time you will see in the you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also nakal ah but the girl quite angel ah tapi macam devil lah kan but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible lah
and my mum says that my my dad is zouk so kedekut
I don't want they they even like when I was growing up you know through my years they ajak me go there also I don't want you know

if you think of it pasal dia macam cardio tau like you have to move everywhere kena jalan sini kena jalan sana strength ada tapi
tak penat ke dah dah lari habis tu nak main badminton nak anuh evolve lagi best nya gitu
like I join choir habis tu
it look at our experiences tapi
susah tau macam nak cari company macam gitu pasal
buangkan kerja apa-apa kerja pun dekat you then like you don't even know
tapi there's this like
she doing arts tapi
in my job I really put in a lot of effort I work hard tapi like this girl she just goes in and then like she just be friends with the manager habis tu
she gets the job like as a head you know and everything semua I buat tau
like she literally throw everything to me to do then she asked me how to do this not I teach her lah macam ajar dia nak buat
dorang tak actually buat
like the care like in that sense pasal they are only thinking about assessment academic
kesian seh budak-budak itu
to say that dorang tak boleh cakap
dorang tak tahu ke benda ni semua ada like
tak payah kerja kat situ lagi lah macam
kesian seh budak-budak macam gitu
itu lah
like my my parents tak
last time senang jer duduk dekat rumah tengok dah habis kerja dah habis sekolah tengok habis tu makan habis tu boleh baring tidur

tak sweet lah duit tak ada oi
he is sweet he's very nice tapi
ah nak makan nasi eh

ikut lah
sweet nya
okay lah like kalau you nak tips kan I will say
tapi jangan like take it too hard lah
it's it's just like how they expect you to be all these tapi
actually have lah my my mother ada kata sikit like last time
you know semut
minum kencing it's actually
try to reduce as much lah jangan minum banyak sangat
tapi kita selalu makan nasi seh hari-hari
sakit macam mana seh macam gitu
bukan senang seh macam gitu
so kalau gitu nak kena makan apa seh
itu lah
mahal juga seh
tapi sayur-sayuran jer tau
sayur-sayuran dengan sauce
betul lah tapi
kena jaga seh
kalau macam you know
like rosak kan you you call it
I rasa macam
so so they they drove back home dia naik naik kereta balik ke mana
rumah dia kat mana lah
tapi is that macam intentionally or
so dia tak
you tahu tak yang like
crazy lah macam it's a wild thing but then
budak-budak ni semua belajar dari mak bapa dorang pe
so kalau dorang kurang ajar dengan mak bapa dorang sendiri
anak dorang confirm ikut punya
tak akan lah anak tak sayang mak bapa
memang lah
tapi sedih tau like I see my parents kalau dorang
dia kan tinggal sorang
hope yang kadang-kadang dia tinggal dengan kita instead lah macam
she's alone dia sorang-sorang kat rumah
so if anything happens siapa nak jagakan dia seh
telephone dia ask her how is she all these like
quite old already kaki sakit
dari dulu tau dari kecil dia kata
bila dia dekat rumah kan dia rasa macam
dia kerja dekat McDonald tau
usually hari minggu gitu lah dia kerja like
two to three days gitu tapi
the day she worked kan makin sikit
kerja ah
geylang punya
pasar lah
just to macam jalan-jalan
tak okay habis tu
nak jalan sini nak jalan sana habis tu kalau anything happen siapa nak
jaga kan
tak tahu tak berapa tahu ah tapi
sixty to seven no tak lah
macam gitu ah
tua sangat tapi macam she at that age where she get her
she already have her semua tapi tak nak duduk kat rumah macam
pergi lah relax sikit ke apa
some more she stay alone tak akan lah want to work so hard also
nobody's taking care of her lah like bills semua
like kita punya families semua jaga kan
and from bills electricity bills kita pun bayar apa
kalau you kan
if you dah tua
dah ada duit tu semua kan
you nak pergi mana
ada tak tempat yang you nak
or attractions tapi jangan lah tua sangat ke macam like forty ke
bila I pergi kan
tembok tu cantik tau
the culture there is different okay lah dorang racists from what I heard
they are racists tapi macam their culture like how they move is like very free
the tembok tembok tembok bricks
tak faham lah tapi macam
tapi like
ada lagi ramai orang tua dari orang muda kan
um this orang-orang tua semua ni kan kena kerja keras pasal
like tengok
family dengan lima anak
abeh I pun macam tertanya tau macam
ah even the government helping them pasal macam like you can see tau macam
tak tahu family planning ke apa
like okay maybe they they love kids dorang sayangkan anak-anak
kids tapi
it seems very chaotic macam dorang tak tentu arah
dorang betul-betul suka lah anak-anak semua
but then not so big lah tak nak besar sangat
nanti siapa nak jaga seh nak kerja habis tu nak kena
I tak boleh masak I tak boleh
I tak tahu macam mana nak kemas rumah tau sebenarnya
I rasa
tak tentu arah like I don't know
siapa nak jaga seh so I have to
for now tengah cari kerja nak sustain
some maybe dapat
hopefully lah dapat
scholarship ke apa
kejadah scholarship untuk tolong
duit lah
pun tak faham sangat dorang tau dorang punya subject macam mana how you
on what I want to do apa I nak buat
dulu I
selalu go with the flow tau like I had I had the mindset ni to just go with the flow
I nak
cause a snowball effect to tau tu pasal I
dapat degree
pasal I see all my friends
kawan-kawan kan
semua dah habis degree tau
you nak tahu tahu you tahu tak
I malam-malam kan
kadang-kadang I fikir tau
kenapa I ambil
kalau I
didn't do anything I tunggukan boyfriend jer
I betul-betul harap
dorang accept I
pasal kan
I know it's gonna be tough tapi
I kena cuba
like if not now bila
I perlukan pertolongan lah in that area
marketing is on demand tu pasal lah susah nak cari kerja
tu lah kerja I dulu
betul you know like
pasal kita nak experiences kan they think they don't really take us
tapi actually I think yang if it is a very good
pasal if
tapi did you know that I mention
like I kata tadi like
even intern job dorang minta experiences
that is the funny part to me lah pasal dorang nak experiences tapi
they ask so you boleh imagine tak like
tapi you gotta
you gotta work hard for it lah macam
that's a very good question actually tapi kan talking about movies
you want a genre yang you suka tak
I suka
perlukan itu lah bantal
untuk cover muka
tak lah actually
I tengok
horror like not really horror it's like thriller tapi
you akan jumpa jodoh you juga trust me
so tak payah tak payah nak sedih-sedih semua
you ada Netflix tak
okay tengok lah
tak akan obsessed punya lah confirm like okay
actually game game ni semua kan kalau you start you memang suka
tapi bila dah kelamaan kan
you rasa macam alamak boring lah macam
I nak main hari-hari
you dapat buat kawan
you tak nak
you rasa macam
kawan-kawan you juga
kalau you nak main kan
tak apa I boleh control kan you
I akan tolong you
tapi like
some level kan I tak boleh
lagi-lagi kalau I main dengan adik
you know I maki dia
ah dia tak main lah dia main FIFA
I rasa that you should
I tak invest I tak buat investment tapi my boyfriend does it
dia dia tak okay at first
dia ada banyak duit kan abeh dia invest

boleh lah eh
mine I would say ah alhamdulillah I'm I'm very grateful for the results cause I expected worse but I guess my lecturers were just being lenient ah
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we uh our exam punya duration would be like three hours right
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual ah question answer kind of thing ah cause ya ya cause it's like um I'm taking it uh for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's err what's the subject oh education secondary uh educational psychology nya subject so it's like
tu lah like err initially I was like
sorry sorry banyak kan aiya but
lima soalan jer lepastu saya harus jawab kan dalam masa empat puluh lapan jam ye puan-puan
is it macam like I I sound very distant
dengar oh faham faham
faham jer cause like
um apa tu
mm mm mm faham faham faham
bahasa melayu nusantara ya so ya I mean ya but you are taking level two right ya so ya so like she I mean it's good lah cause it's like monday until thursday
ya merdeka ya tu lah
uh cerita dia like it's about um cerita dia it's about like um this person
eh aku selama ni err dekat dunia aku aku
buat jahat jer tapi kenapa like ya tapi kenapa like she's quite dia macam like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like um tapi kenapa aku dekat the good place like shouldn't be ya macam like tak ke patut ya lah tak ke patut aku dekat the bad place ya but then turns out that
it's a funny show ya it's comedy it's like eh dia nya genre is like comedy
cannot ah eh ya I mean at times it's very macam cringey uh and very like cliche the storyline
ya ya ya ya it's it's done that time dorang baru habis like I think it's around
no no no no like finish for this season ah and like boleh show ah
ya so I think dia baru dia baru habis jer like this year
hmm let me think I tak tahu ah cause like you you tadi cakap kan you not easily impressed
takut eh macam dah I dah list everything dah like and then suddenly oh oh oh I mean like I have a full list of recommendations ah if you want
really ah like like I mean like what you usually do you you just scroll ke macam mana
mmhmm ah can can can at at times it can be like macam it can it can trigger your macam thoughts juga ah like macam
um faham faham I can see I can see ah ya ya ya ya
and they don't mind tau like they just put their macam opinion on the twitter out there and macam
to me it's so brave and it takes a lot of courage to do that I just cannot macam like imagine the the what the critics ah I mean I think the critics are like macam I think I I I'm usually macam scared about like
the critics or like how people will judge me after that ah basically like oh you have this kind of thought macam you know kind of thing but then ya I mean it has uh huh
can can macam there's something that stopping you kan macam err okay to me usually I would say
to me I will usually say um ya sorry to me I usually macam what's stopping me at the same time is like my baseless assumptions ah atau macam baseless thought faham ke macam I didn't do a lot of reading but this is what I thought so I'm not sure like if I should like express it you get what I mean
ya ya ya ya oh my god oh my god faham faham faham faham macam like oh you you have this kind of like ya ya ya
ya but ya I also like respect them ah like um I mean like ah as to what you said just now about like I mean let's say if macam somebody or someone doesn't really agree with that that that opinion of theirs
like they are able to actually discuss about it faham ke
like to me I think if I were to put something kan then if another person would reply then I would be so cuak already like macam okay so what should I answer now macam wonder like
kan kan kan like I wouldn't deactivate cause of that ah basically macam like I wouldn't deactivate twitter just cause I I know that like through twitter you can get uh like updates ah like and they talk about like this sensitive I mean like especially I mean the millennials right you know right
mm mm mm like macam it's very toxic eh why would they share but
true true ya I mean and how's instagram been for you though I mean ya instagram aplikasi instagram ya I mean like do you think it's overwhelming as well

eh adik aku pula kawan aku buat kat pearlista

ada promo ah
dia nak macam kau appointment dulu
kat karva
so semua lima puluh dollar
aku tak pernah buat nail
no buang duit ah
dia ya
then aku nak buat rambut
kalau macam pendek gini perm tak lawa
then nak macam
I was thinking of err pakai wig
eh ada satu yang bagus punya wig
actually I was kind of thinking of doing something macam similar
because I kind of miss macam
buat benda like I miss being like creative I guess
so like aku rasa like um
I follow a lot of macam Instagram shops actually and like
because like aku sekarang kirakan aku I don't have eh no no no sorry I have free time now
I mean I'm a bit I I was kind of used to dapat kerja but
yes dah so um I think
I think maybe I want to macam
I mean I I always see I selalu cakap nak
baju you know what I mean but then I I don't know ah I don't know where to start where do you start
I know that a lot of people have like macam
aku aku maybe rasa macam low-key aku boleh I can tell that some people
pandemic punya tu then like
and I mean I understand also lah cause aku pun sama juga
like at first aku pun sama juga but then like
aku macam low-key macam not not jealous but macam
I don't know how to explain the feeling ah I think I think aku macam
it makes me want to start my own not not that I want to start my own or what it's just macam
semua dia punya kedai semua macam sama-sama you know then like
obviously kita orang like feel like we can do better so
the thing is right yang yang kau cakap pasal the embroidery punya tote bag tu it's
honestly kan I nampak pernah nampak dekat TikTok
so like I I tend to scroll through and kadang-kadang I come across eh bukan apa uh the TikTok is like
macam shop punya lah then I saw this one I'm pretty sure it's a or or whatever it's a foreign punya
country punya shop then this girl basically
she does the same thing dia buat tote bag then she pakai sewing machine then the way that she realise
she can do the embroidery too it's because dia punya machine ada dia punya function abeh aku macam dalam kepala otak aku aku macam
isn't that like macam no offence
I understand it probably takes a time to macam like sit there and actually like betulkan settings and all it tapi macam
kalau it's like simple to and it's not her herself tengah embroidered right is the machine doing it
that orang singapore buat so macam kalau is macam simple gitu then like
one particular this uh apa ni account like jual
apa tu spectacle chain or whatever
maybe have baju custom fit for their own
kadang-kadang boleh pakai S kadang-kadang boleh pakai M depends lah uh most of the time S M gitu
then like you know how they have those uh sizes macam
kalau Cotton On they have um S M or like
how is it that this uh yang I tengah pakai ni like it's considered S M then I'm like does it fit every
you M but you on the verge of L like kau boleh sumbat ke ni
apa tu nama dia not really don't really have a lot of free ya loose so ya
to me and you I guess cause kita orang dua selalu baca kan so kita tahu like what's the difference
ada a few kedai kedai macam
online macam Loop Garms
there's also another one dekat jalan pisang yang Flame V that's that's one I always go to actually
because it's not that high sangat dia punya prices but ya like apa
and is actually this ah you tahu uh jericho
like he was really a fan of the nineties punya semua so
pernah pergi area itu then like macam a few times drop by already together
then I think dia selalu berbual dengan one of the owner I think isaac or whatever then um
I was like kenapa kau tak nak tanya jer jer lah but then he macam malu so I decided to do it
then apparently that shirt is a hundred dollars then aku macam
macam mana boleh hundred dollars ni macam expensive gila
maybe it's cause macam maybe it's imported from somewhere macam
then like they take into account like shipping fee and stuff like that tapi macam I don't know it's like
cause honestly it's not cause thrifting is macam
I mean the the concept is the same it's just that vintage kau betul-betul pay the price for the vintage ah thrifting
I mean in I think actually it is vintage if it's like lama gila and like
you can see that is macam been used before and stuff like that it is vintage in a sense but then vintage in my opinion is more like
because it can also be an investment what kalau
that shirt yang chris jericho punya shirt tu technically it can be an investment cause like
they maybe not don't really know of chris jericho ah cause dia kan lama-lama sikit kan
ah ya dia macam punya tu but like
ten twenty years down the road maybe even fifty years down the road maybe there will still be people who's still willing to macam
old like old outfits old trends and then they want to make it macam baru balik it's either they follow
is either they follow the old trends or they take the old trends and make it baru
kita orang just I don't know like how to I don't know how to explain pe seh but I guess like it's been berapa the fashion industry dah lama
ah dibina so like
like people dulu macam tak kesah but like at least now kita orang macam
lelaki tu meant well but then
kind of um macam mana nak cakap eh
macam misused it
right misuse and also macam ya lah just salah guna
I honestly I honestly think it's cause kita orang macam
just kita orang no longer live in that
so like once we use something we just nak buang
we we are actually talking about apa tu uh kedai right
you just cuba lah jual to to your like whoever who's ordered you ada berapa banyak order sekarang
oh tapi belum
orh yang uh yang backpack tu eh orh K
I think maybe you just try to sell to to the current orders sekarang ni yang you ada kan
you once you dah dibayar um
honestly kalau you nak kan promote is actually not that
you can actually macam
apa eh
but then if you buat macam specific ads or whatever right
it will normally show up macam kau bila kau tengok story orang kan it will pop up between stories gitu
it's not really macam
I think you got I think you pernah tag me under
like cause it's very macam it's not only unique but then like it's very macam ikut
demand gitu it's kind of cool
I would I would probably suggest uh macam
kau start with a few design abeh kau
macam kau post dulu then whichever is popular
like kau just keep note like take note in your head which one's popular then um kalau
kalau ada um
orang macam minta or whatever
like I guess you can just macam buat macam poll lah on your story whatever then you just ask like
uh kalau kau tak kau tak macam tanya customer kau like apa dorang nak and stuff like that it's hard to gauge and like what if
kau tak ada inspiration you know what I mean like what if tiba-tiba you
then obviously it will be susah what so I think it's important to have like
dia ada following so senang in my opinion no offence lah kalau kau ada the following kan
it's just easier for you to macam jual benda cause kau dah ada following banyak orang dia ada dua puluh K tau
dua puluh ribu sorry dua puluh K on her main account ya so like
I'm sure okay maybe not all of them will watch but maybe like ten K gitu akan tengok apa
ya maybe like half gitu at most I mean at least maybe ten K
dia tak ada lining eh kat dalam
ya some shops do that kat singapore pun ada cause actually I think I got follow
one I don't remember what's her name but dorang
pernah macam promote a few smaller businesses
then macam that's so cute cause like macam you know like support local ya exactly support local gitu
I kind of macam considered cause you know how I like I love to wear macam outerwear again
actually I considering macam belajar macam mana nak buat cause I love
I love outerwear macam gini I I don't know cause like I don't want to make it like so thick
but I love outerwear gini like I love I don't know why but I think I love the baggy look a lot
I stress out about the fact that I have free time abeh
bila aku dah stress out pasal free time until nanti aku cari kerja pula abeh abeh like I never use that free time wisely
actually um kau tahu kan uh I was considering uh apa tu
uh sambung belajar ya
because my parents are quite okay lah I'm very blessed because they quite supportive lah dorang macam
dorang okay kalau aku nak kerja ke nak belajar ke
dorang macam aku punya pasal nak buat apa but
still thinking about it and then one of the things aku realise
because uh aku dah I know aku baru kerja dua jobs but I I guess my parents pun realise macam
aku macam adaptable cause like
whenever aku kerja senang jer adapt to the situation cause it's just kerja what you know what I mean like it's not really
but ya so uh apa aku macam realise
a part of me macam
I realised that kalau kau tahu accounting
course kau tak pernah tu eh
is I don't know why I didn't do well but honestly is quite simple it's just macam
I don't know how to explain kau tahu macam
tak it's not that um
kau pernah dengar the term macam assets liability
all that right ya is basically is basically macam
how do I put this normally businesses ada accounting accountant
so basically uh accountant ni macam keep track of their balances
macam accounts lah apa-apa account bank account ke apa ke like
there will always be balance right then you can see like kau spend on what and stuff like that basically it's meant to
the job is meant to tengok and make sure that the accounts balance cause if there's
something macam off sikit dorang kena track kenapa off and like
why is it off like maybe dia macam
it's either terlebih or terlalu sikit then they must check where it is lah
aku pernah belajar kan I told you right I I think I took it for O level but I never
um bila aku fikir balik
it's not difficult lah it's just that at that time aku tak interested nak belajar tu benda cause like it's
aku aku rasa cikgu aku just dreadful agaknya ah
but ya then like kalau accounting kan actually ada banyak
ada banyak sector cause you can do auditing you can do ah bookkeeping
if you are an accountant kan kau macam
in a way kau boleh jadi your own boss I guess
I don't know I'm that's the way my parents put it lah but kalau kau
ada macam some form of background in accounting senang sikit kau nak
dapat kerja in a way
because I think the the main thing is cause you know how sekarang kan pandemic kan
so like ah kalau kau fikir balik the main
mana-mana pun food ada kan and um
these things are the macam industries that won't be so affected for some reason I don't know why
and what ah but like you know ah apa tu
tak interested untuk tengok> but I always see that one scene pop up the one where she makes that comment lah about that guy
oh aku tak suka ah plot macam gitu
you know like what we said about sustainable fashion kita orang no longer ignorant
so because kita orang no longer ignorant I guess um
dorang just trying to fit into
betul like a proper cause that they doing like
like black character to be extremely loud or whatever just ikut just ikut stereotype you know what I mean
nama dia jason like in the show jason dengan
honestly aku rasa aku rasa macam mana I I know I had a point but then like
pasal kita dah berbual aku macam lost my point ah mm
sekejap eh
aku rasa okay pasal tadi kau berbual pasal yang hijab tu kan
yang firefighter and then the grey's anatomy bodoh lah it's so it's ah it's just
low-key aku rasa is because dorang ada
fascination dengan budak
aku rasa dorang ada I think right it it low-key has something to do with also
I don't want to say it ah but I think aku low-key rasa porn has something to do with it because
it's not a uncommon thing aku rasa lah K is not that I know
I mean honestly aku uh bila aku I honestly feel bad for her cause like
she unintentionally might have contributed to that but also bila kau tengok balik
it's not not budak-budak melayu I think
I think in general lelaki melayu I don't know why not all
guys tend to macam wonder what a woman okay the woman can be completely covered tapi dorang will wonder for some reason I don't know how
will wonder what the woman is wearing underneath then aku macam
like aku tak akan pernah fikir pasal dorang punya
tu tau
kadang-kadang dorang ada dorang punya argument kadang-kadang is
but lelaki pun kena kena rogol pe something like that lelaki pun ya they sometimes bring that up as a point tapi aku macam
but why would you like it's not like okay dorang selalu macam
fikir kita orang tak faham or like
we always fight for just kita orang but like we actually fighting for other people also what
it's not just kita orang fikirkan pasal perempuan jer it's that just so happens
perempuan suffer more
pasal kita perempuan like
ikut biology or whatever but then
some of us aren't exactly build to macam
kecil I um kecil
okay ah aku faham
dorang masih buat cerita macam tu macam uh it's either kahwin kaya ke
kahwin uh apa tu bukan kahwin kaya not only that uh
ah kahwin contract
aku tak tahu aku tahu kenapa dorang tak boleh single
like okay aku low-key rasa kan
kita orang uh sebagai melayu kita orang actually maybe we don't really
actually had okay lah kita ada nafsu tapi macam aku rasa the only reason kita motivated by kita punya nafsu
it's also by cerita-cerita macam gini that like promote kita untuk
macam encourage kita untuk macam apa macam
oh kahwin kahwin sikit-sikit kahwin kahwin kahwin muda
kahwin tua pun ada kadang-kadang cerita merepek sia
uh uh kadang-kadang kadang-kadang problem dia dalam perkahwinan boleh kahwin lagi aku macam
like like the common plots is always macam apa kau tak boleh produce baby ke
pastu kahwin kahwin kenapa kau tak boleh adopt ke apa ke like why
I I aku rasa tak akan achieve
aku tengok drama jer the world of married
it's about this girl she's very successful macam dia jadi the associate director
in the first place dia macam
tak tahu whether she
he really cheat dekat dia ke tak eventually ah she found out ah and about the girl and everything
then there's a lot of drama with the girl cause the girl macam
although dia tahu that he is a married man dia tetap nak dengan
because the guy has always been macam
so dia the wife
then but then in the end dorang
uh cerai lah
then cerai the the wife manage to take all her wealth back
ah loving loving some falling in love is not a crime then I'm just like apa seh
now like the story I masih kat episode nine so like
the uh kay the son right is so irritating seh dia dah besar pun dia macam

oh my god penthouse you know there was this article yang dorang cakap they found a helicopter

orh that time you ada stop I kat lima puluh lima jer
tak ah
I dah lama tak main piano
I asyik baik-baik
main piano benda sama jer
tak tahu ah macam malas gitu nak belajar
you know I ask my colleague ah eh why you don't want to talk to me in malay then you tahu apa dia cakap
then after that he try to subtlely cakap melayu with me then I find it so cute seh
cause like he trying to say that he tak ngam with his
then he was like cause actually I never ngam with my ex-supervisor then I was like LOL LOL LOL
termenung jauh nampak then it's so weird to hear him speak malay seh but at least he made the effort
he also penat he won't talk one ah we just like so glad that then he said eh tak happy ke nak off day
biasa ah tak ada kerja
tak apa if you nak I masak kan I think dapur tu terbakar terus
cause kan I have a friend uh nama dia amelia
I don't know what she was cooking ah tapi kan dia kasi bila dia kasi family dia makan kan semua kena food poisoning
I don't even know I think wait I think she was baking some sugar cookie entah
I think untuk raya ke pe but then I don't know what she put inside baking soda wait you do put baking soda inside cookies right
okay then I don't know what she put inside that poisoned her entire family but ya selain dari masak is there any other position I can do anything but cooking
I don't mind as long duit halal and it doesn't involve cooking or maths because I'm not good at maths I mean like if simple calculation saya boleh tapi you nak I buat algebra tu semua mampus
okay oh my god thank you so much you know I've gone for so many interviews kan but then semua orang tak nak orang pakai hijab hijab atau melayu like there was this one tuition centre that I applied for they were like happy with my grades tu semua and then dorang dah dorang accept tau and then lepas tu dorang tanya like for my race lah and then like what language I speak tu semua then I was like oh
I malay and then I give him my full name then he was like oh I'm sorry but um the position has been filled so we cannot hire you then I was like bro you just mentioned not too long ago that you wanted to hire me then sekarang mentang-mentang I kata that
I melayu you don't wanna hire me anymore
entah lah and then like there was another company ah err it was an accounting company so I'm from uh I was from a media course then I have a media diploma then I went for this um digital marketing job and the person told me during the interview that I don't have the qualifications but in order to get a job at their company I need to be willing to buka my hijab
kan so I ask lah kenapa nak kena buka hijab and then they were like oh cause they deal with a lot of um western people western clients european people and these people they don't really like working with orang islam
pada diorang kan pemikiran dorang ialah
kita orang jahat so kalau dorang nampak yang company ni ada pekerja islam pakai hijab tu semua kan dorang tak nak work with this company
and then the thing is the thing that upsets me the most is that they paksa the pekerja kat situ untuk buka hijab there's like dua ke tiga pekerja kat situ at first dorang kerja boleh pakai hijab tau then all of a sudden I think new management ke pe ah dorang kena terpaksa buka hijab cause kalau tak dorang kena buang kerja
and then you know ah sekarang tengah COVID nineteen nak cari kerja bukan main susah kan so those few workers had no choice but to buka hijab dorang kesian seh wah aku macam nak sepak jer muka dorang like eh bro what does us wearing a hijab have anything to do with our capabilities or anything my mak kerja dekat company besar okay it's a it's an american company that was bought over by a japanese company
and in this company my mak pakai hijab pun boleh naik pangkat tinggi tau you know and there's ramai orang islam kat situ in fact one of her receptionist just converted to islam
and they are okay with them wearing hijab so what is this small local accounting company so against orang pakai hijab you know I think that's just them being racist
menyampah seh
and it's not just in malaysia that orang islam boleh pakai hijab like there's a lot of countries out there that allows their muslim workers to wear hijab even though I have to admit lah singapore lagi bagus sebab the racism isn't really that obvious here but still though you know my I my uh obek kan she actually works at I don't remember which hospital but then she has to remove her hijab
and she's not even a nurse she's just what is she doing ah uh I think she was doing laundry ya so dude you are doing laundry you don't even have to face the people like the um orang-orang semua pesakit-pesakit so like why do you have to remove the hijab that's so stupid what does have wearing a hijab have anything to do with doing laundry I can wear a hijab and do laundry also
his group was in a different court sedih seh I susah-susah penat-penat belajar squash join squash but then tak sama-sama pun
diana wants to set me up with her boyfriend's friend and her boyfriend I'm sorry to say this okay if you ever meet her don't tell her that I told you this tapi kan boyfriend dia kan tak handsome langsung
ya so her boyfriend is a muka muka bukan perangai perangai dia okay lah like he's okay except for the fact that he procrastinates a lot
like okay I I admit that I'm no saint myself but and I procrastinate a lot a lot tapi kan dia kan okay like there was this one time where his boss gave him this job two weeks ago and then he promised her on like okay first week second week the friday kan on the day that he was supposed to submit to um his work to his boss he promised diana that he was going to go on a date with her
tapi kan you fikir bila dia start dia punya kerja nope the day itself like the day of submission itself
kan and then on that day I I was out lah so I didn't notice diana texting me and then lepas tu bila I check my phone kan diana was like eh babe you free tak nak keluar I tengah bosan ni tengah tunggu my guy and then lepas tu I I cuma layan dia via text sebab cause I tak boleh jumpa dia I tengah kat luar pe and then lepas tu dia pukul dua baru dia datang then the whole time she was calling him and texting him dia tak jawab dia mengamuk dengan diana
kan and then lepas tu dia tak minta maaf tak apa
ya and then lepas tu dia bilang<malay diana kan err eh I tak suka tau you asyik call I tanya I kat mana huh text I spam I nanti I dah habis kerja I bilang you lah you jangan nak spam boleh I tak suka
kan oh my god I was so mengamuk and the fact that he didn't apologise to her like bruh who the hell do you think you are you are not even handsome okay and that's not the worst part okay so he has done that quite a lot of time lah that's not the worst part the worst is that dia tak percaya dengan tuhan
he said that tuhan tak wujud there's no such thing as god
but but the fact that you call yourself a muslim tapi you tak percaya dalam tuhan like why do you even bother calling yourself a muslim
ya like like I respect everyone's belief lah tapi kalau you tak percaya you you tak percaya lah you jangan nak bilang orang lain you don't try to force your belief onto other people
diana dia bukannya halal sangat
tapi pun dia tetap percaya dalam tuhan you jangan nak shake her beliefs tau huh you jangan nak bilang dia tuhan tak wujud tu semua it's up to her what she want to believe in
siapa dia nak sembah kalau dia nak sembah tuhan syukur alhamdulillah bagus lah untuk dia you jangan nak marah-marah dia jangan nak tengking dia kena percaya dalam tuhan boleh tak you tak suka you cari perempuan lain ah
the lelaki is he's a medic so I don't mind medics lah
makes me sound like some narcissistic but anyway I bilang dia ah I bilang dorang yang oh err maaf ah tapi I'm sure your friend is a great guy tapi I don't think kita jodoh and then lepas tu I kata but then if you nak kita jadi kawan I tak kisah
so you you nak I cakap dengan dia okay but you need to make sure that he understands that it's only as kawan nothing more nothing less kawan saja okay then dia okay okay then lepas tu I kata okay I don't him to have my number I don't want him to have my social media account I don't want him to know anything about me unless I believe that you know we can be friends tu semua lah we can click as friends
right I don't even wah he called me golden child I was like so lost like is that is that supposed to be a reference to anything like I'm sorry I watch anime but I don't really watch other shows like what what is golden child even and then lepas tu dia kata uh he he started going on about how so um our friends decided to matchmake us cause they believe we're perfect for each other then I'm like bruh
I told them that it is never going to work out between us as anything more than as friends so you jangan nak fikir-fikir jauh-jauh boleh tak he really believe that kita perfect for each other tau
this isn't really a matchmaking event or anything so like you tak suka you tak suka lah boleh belah like in a more polite way okay then he just screenshot my reply he sent it to my friend and her boyfriend then they they were like scolding me like eh why are you sending him such a formal reply you know you sepatutnya cakap gini-gini you jangan nak cakap gitu boleh tak huh
kesian tau dia then I was like kesian dia I your kawan untuk lebih dari tujuh tahun okay you tak kesiankan I
kan and then she was trying to sell him to me like oh he has a ducati he has a lot of motor he's a medic he earns a lot like five figure or something then I was like bruh I know lah I I mata duitan juga tapi I tak lah gitu teruk mentang-mentang dia kaya you fikir I akan apa stead dengan dia
I ada standard
kalau dia apa kacak sikit eh I don't mind lah and then lepas tu kalau personality dia okay I don't mind but the thing is he just broke up with his chinese girlfriend of like I don't know how many years they were like going they were like super steady for so long they were going to get married tu semua but then um the girl's parents tak tak suka cause um dia islam perempuan tu christian ke pe
ya so they just broke up then then it's like what am I a rebound you are not even that good looking bro just find someone else I'm sorry man ya and then lepas tu sampai sekarang diana keeps on saying that oh she wants to set us up then next time kita hang out together kan dia nak bawa lelaki tu nama dia rudy
nama pun old-fashioned
eww mad ah bro I don't even like the name sorry wah fuck I found I sound so kurang ajar seh no but serious that's I don't know like I just feel like he's not my type like we can never click there's no chemistry between us like seriously who starts up a convo by calling the girl golden child
dia fikir kan we were being match made tau so he's really into the idea like he told um diana's boyfriend and diana told me that he's really up for being match made with me kan that's that's how I reacted like like what with first of all I've never even met diana's boyfriend okay second of all we've never met each other I I deleted telegram
after he sent me that message and then I replied to him I deleted telegram so um I don't know if he sent me any messages lah I haven't re-downloaded it and I don't think I will anytime soon and then lepas tu kan um so diana kata err oh I have like my standard tinggi sangat lah I tak boleh pilih-pilih sangat tu semua so she's giving by the end of the month she knows where I live by the way
I'm segan too but I would rather be match made with a guy who is at least like who have something in common with me than with this guy you understand why when I send you his picture
tak boleh seh seriously do you know any guy like it doesn't have to be we don't have to be anything more than friends but I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend all my friends all my guy friends are in and they are either taken or seriously weird
I know lah but I betul-betul tak nak seh dengan lelaki ni and I I don't know who else I can go to to ask for like eh you know any guy friends who can like help me out pretend to be my boyfriend for a while cause oh my god everytime I meet her every dude
um apparently um she's meeting up with her boyfriend tomorrow and she said that her boyfriend is going to bring his friend so she felt segan to go along with him because she doesn't know any of his friends but I know for sure that that is code for she's bringing that rudy guy along
cause she'll know that eh tak kan hari-hari ada family matter seh
you know sekarang kan nak masuk masjid you kena macam register dulu tu semua and then satu kali nak masuk cuma berapa sepuluh orang
ya so nope I think I'm just going to stay home but I do need to find a guy ASAP do you think your kakak knows anyone
so ya and then um we there was this one group project where the teachers group us up and then she was in my group so I was sleeping over in school and then after that she kept on touching me and hugging me and wah and then we had a sleepover in school cause to finish our project kan then lepas tu dia asyik macam pegang-pegang dengan I
then like then then like geli seh
she just pindah to like a few blocks away from me in year two and that was when she started um suka I
kan and setiap pagi kan err cause setiap kali I nak gi sekolah I selalu pergi dengan my mak my mak turun kat jurong then I tukar kat jurong pe and then lepas tu kan nanti dalam tau-tau jer selalu I naik I selalu naik kat belakang sekali
like the last door kan second cabin last door then lepas tu I tengok tau
I selalu tak nampak dia tau-tau je pintu dah tutup pusing-pusing tak ada orang dia dekat belakang I
I usually berdiri dekat pintu yang you know pintu yang selalu tak buka
ya I I duduk kat I selalu berdiri kat situ tau I tak nampak dia<malay tau tau-tau dia akan appear dia akan kata
so so I told her that err indirectly like oh um you know um I have a crush cause at that time I was I had a crush on this guy we called him camera guy but I think I can tell you his name ah cause different school pe nama dia
ya but he was err he was in my academic school we were from together and then lepas tu kan um dia selalu macam everytime there's an event he's like the photographer ah so my friends and I will call him camera guy so that people won't know that we're talking about him
ya and then lepas tu that err I keep on telling the girl who like me like oh you know I saw camera guy again today and then he's so hot tu semua then like I would always purposely mention him whenever she tries to like make a move on me
so at the end of it kita semua marah dia ah
then lepas tu dia tak suka I lagi
ya and then there was another girl who like me also and then um that girl was a bit weird lah because she was telling me about how she was asexual and all that then all of a sudden dia kata oh but you know I wouldn't mind dating you
basically it's like I don't really know how to explain it but it's like social innovation tu semua
ya so um we doing gen ed we would combine classes with other courses tu semua so there was this one girl she was from design and ya she was from design school I forgot which design school she was from um she we we went camping together like it was a school camp lah school trip then she was in my group and she was my roommate for the entire trip it was a week long
ya I I I just I just smile and say oh okay sure err I'm just going to do my work over there but you can go on and shower and then and then lepas tu kan so um she's usually not in the room lah like um she she met this she met this uh guy from we were sleeping in a dorm it was a collaboration with a an indonesian uni
my friends and I we will like sometimes we would just sit on her bed cause it was the closest to the door so we will just sit on her bed like all of our beds lah and then some people would just sit on her bed and then usually like we will like macam basah gitu tau dia nya tilam dia you know what she was doing right
at first we didn't know either because we thought okay maybe like dia habis mandi dia tak lap badan dia betul-betul so dia duduk abeh basah and then lepas tu<malay last day kan bila kita dah nak balik then she just told us oh you know the reason why it's always wet then we're like why kenapa you kena bilang kita like at least okay you bilang kita at the end of the trip but but why kenapa tak bilang kita at start atau you tak bilang kita langsung
I did not need to know what I touched I oh my god and then kan the whole trip she would comment on my badan tu semua tau like oh um
apa cause um she's very open her boyfriend is also super open
she said um if if she's ever like uh if she ever wants to do a threesome dia nak panggil I then I was like okay you ada nombor I and then lepas tu lepas tu I tak contact dia lagi
kan and you fikir it was a one week trip okay or was it two weeks it was almost two weeks actually mak mak I I I tak tahu nak nak happy sebab orang ingat I cantik atau geli sebab I terpegang benda tu atau oh my god I don't even know what to feel man
you ada you ada gambar dia
so err he confessed to me in it was in june holiday I don't remember which part of june holiday and then lepas tu kan uh he he suddenly texted me one four three then I was like one four three apa benda seh so I look it up online lah like I I didn't reply I was like looking up what is one four three then apparently it was like this um
so it means I love you and then I was like oh hell no bish like first of all I felt nothing for him second of all I I was in this um it wasn't really a relationship but our I had this thing going on with primary school friend lah nama dia irfan
so I just muted him lah like oh I'm really sorry bro but I tak suka you so maybe you should just you know move on lah but kita lagi boleh kawan and then he was like okay then he stopped texting me then you know what he did

so so I was like huh since when then tala kata apa oh ateeb kata we've been dating since sec two ke sec one then I was like bro I have never liked him that way I never accepted to be his girlfriend I never said yes to him or anything
menyampah seh and then um after that we go off contact ah then in sec err year one poly he texted me uh
begging me for forgiveness then I was like okay you know what we're in poly now so I should be the bigger person and maafkan dia you know matang tu semua
so I kata okay lah I forgive you then kita jadi kawan but then we didn't really text a lot and then you know what happen
kan wait don't tell him that that's why he's like he has a inferiority complex against his abang but anyways then I told him like oh um sorry ah but my friend um I just made up a white lie like oh my friend's already dating someone so she's not interested in you or like in dating anyone else and they will I felt like they will be together for a long time cause like they are they are very um into each other tu semua then I I thought he gave up tau

oh is it so so you mean be visible then boleh macam pergi lelaki punya toilet
oh ya ya ya ya okay so your first wish is actually to have a superpower like jadi invisible
ah okay okay so your first wish is to have a superpower then err your second wish actually nak banyak duit lah kaya
oh ah okay okay can can one superpower and lagi satu is nak what you just wanna be like rich begitu or you you you you want to
ten ten K only you have one freaking wish and err ya apa yang kamu tanya is setakat ten K jer ten thousand
like eh I I bet like other people oh I have a wish okay lah aku nak um one one million but but kalau one million macam sikit sangat ah um maybe I want um
I nak err satu satu juta satu juta is it uh one billion I don't know
where no you must answer the last that the third wish you you nak kena answer the the ya
nombor tiga belum jawab ah
ah oh ya you you cuma minta um jadi err invisible tak ada orang boleh nampak then you setakat minta err
you wanna you you wanna have like err sepuluh ribu jer
the ya jadi nombor tiga
only without err only without sucking blood lah jadi err so tak hisap darah ah tak apa kira macam err friendly vampire lah kan
your wish your hajat hajat is untuk dua is superpower
then lagi satu is okay lah a a genuine err general wish ah
ah hajat yang tepat lah kan
goblin apa pula goblin what's
what right um apa ya uh um
I think um tengok cerita-cerita macam psychological thriller err those err political err zaman dulu-dulu punya like you know the olden days
then err also macam bunuh-bunuh orang punya like those murder kind of scenes
eh is not cartoon eh dia bukan eh
you nak tahu kan my three wishes also

and pass down to the generation also lah macam maybe ha
um maybe dalam
apa ya
what is uh million in malay ribu err juta err
juta then ribu is billion
ribu thousand juta is million then billion
billion you don't know juta ah okay so dalam
beberapa juta sia
okay lah then like that kalau nak safe
safe to say err dalam seratus seratus juta
seratus juta also equivalent to one billion right

hais sedih this young generation one that listen to old generation but don't don't want to keep the middle mid gen
ah ah apa apa fikir ah fikir fikir is it seems like you
ah apa apa dia
err duduk kat kerusi then
ah apa benda yang dah sampai
ya but dah grown immune lah so macam tak kisah sangat lah
apa dia orang nak fikir fikir ah up to them lah
K if a human's kalau kita manusia tak payah macam err kerja lah then err what would you want to do
what are you doing bukan how are you doing
oh ya I forgot how is your haus kau batuk lagi ke
mm cause aku perasan juga like I notice your cough in your um videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and um and also like when you have kahak in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not um clearing her throat first before she talk
kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
susah tak nak pakai tu like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
oh I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like lambat
orh kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak inhale like deeply ah
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school pun I used to have bad coughs yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama
I have kahak so I have a lot of kahak that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so dia macam satu it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
ah so macam sekarang ni I can recognize it lah when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
macam at that time I think I didn't know cause ah before
actually err is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is um tempeh
err roti kicap
I know I know no but ya I think these three yang betul betul I've been avoiding because
err at first memang I avoided everything I avoided like vitagen yakult lah yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt ah apa tapi macam kalau yogurt is in mm is like a flavor aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak lah
dia is is in at yeast allergy it's like um err fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast kan is a product of fermentation ah so macam tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan because it's like soy bean fermented
ya macam tu sebab lah is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because macam tu lah because uh in some kadang-kadang aku makan
err apa gatal but actually you know uh when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new macam active err areas yang gatal and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad ah episode of sinus punya ni like selsema for like one month
so my dad told me to start err drinking yang effervescent tablets tu barakah
so I did and then he ask me I started err started drinking that and then he said that oh ya it's very bad padahal kan I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains um macam yeast ke apa but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
err so err tapi recently because I at first I memang betul betul jaga my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat kicap because kicap is such a common common thing kalau kau masak kan
so dia
ya ya no at that time she's making nasi goreng sambal sotong tau like leftover sambal sotong so dia letak lah kicap tu sikit just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like aina I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put kicap and I was like
tapi I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so malam tu aku macam aku dah ready lah untuk makan ubat
so at that bad macam is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the gatal pun dia kurang lah I can control it so when err after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
so macam I should start
trying out food yang I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay tapi aku kurang lah I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
ah cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti
err kicap tempeh yogurt jer lah
actually supposed to go and see the doctor bulan enam but at that time kan I was ah I couldn't go because clinic tu dekat tangkak
ya tangkak kat johor but it's far lah
you know why because is betul betul dekat hujung
betul betul dekat hujung dekat singapore like really is like there
so macam
because especially because my house is err dekat danga bay which is
and then my window is facing the um memorial the sungei that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats ada kelong and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya tapi I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger kan mm kalau kitaorang balik johor
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings kan dorang semua dah ready bawa passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari um like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
dorang some some ah dorang tak produce dorang tak hantar that brand dekat malaysia
so they will go there macam is a trip for them and then kitaorang budak-budak would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
we'll all be like so jealous wah tak dapat ikut pergi singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore dengan malaysia takde beza
sama jer kan sebenarnya
ya it's the same I think ya sama jer it's just that you know at that time I was like wow singapore
ah that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the memang my family memang suka makan roti kitaorang we can go through like one bantal yang besar tu like two days so now substitute is wraps lah
mm so macam always ada tu or you know like prata yang frozen
ah kalau if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
croissant croissant itu memang one of the benda yang paling kelakar
because kau dah terbiasa
ya apa
kan cousin aku kan belajar
tunggu jer lah lunch is almost lunch time
usually kau yang masak ke
um I think dia tak not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
err routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize kan it's not it's not just um sapu lotion on dry skin you have to be bilas with water first and then you have to pat dry and then baru you lotion because then baru dia ada moisture
ah ya ya tapi macam you know if I if I mandi awhile like
wear it bilas and then I put lotion and then is very effective kalau you moisturize it overnight
dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga that's why you know when I was
mm but when I was younger and it was bad memang my mom would paksa
err because sometimes it hurts tau untuk mandi cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
so macam masa tu kan I
ah tak tak
yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia powder tapi dia dalam capsule
ah and then eh that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills pasal kau tahu uh sampai menangis like I tried to eat it until I cried
I open the capsule onto a spoon lepastu aku makan
it's disgusting tapi
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know potong tiga ke to get used to it instead of makan powder jer
tapi dia macam faulty lah
can jap I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like uh after I register tak boleh nak log in pun
tak tahu lah dia punya website dia macam faulty tu yang si nai cakap semalam dengan doctor john
ah you when you register to use your apa punya account
try lah nanti apa I think they need to um solve on their site before they do before you can log in
I get it I get it lah but thing is kat you need like a car
ah tu jer lah I think that's that's really the only macam problem that I have
ah itu jer lah tak banyak pun tapi they haven't responded to my email
aku dia ada dia ada dia macam err inquiry box dekat website tu
ah so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive um interns undergraduate internship apa ya program
tapi dorang tak reply maybe I need to email them directly
ya actually I I agree dorang punya one of the malaysia punya government or any authorities when punya weak link weak point is that dorang punya website is very poorly handle
ah bukan tak pandai they don't see the need
ah macam kita kan apa-apa pun kita akan website dulu ah website website
so tapi aku cari lah kat johor kat johor pun banyak juga
more opportunity banyak tempat but it's definitely gonna be far from my house lah
tapi okay lah as long as you know
yes apa ni apa aku cakap oh when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria kan aku pergi dengan shikin
and I saw um some of the stuff dia tengah macam recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
macam like writing on the clipboard so aku tanya dia aku tanya dia uh kalau apa dorang ambil aquaria ni ambil intern ke lepastu dia kata dia pun intern
ya and then she said that uh apa I ask lah yang selalunya yang feeding kan yang diving and feeding tu dia kata anyone that has a diving license boleh I'm like ah
ah tu lah I wonder also
jauh lah tapi it's either you have a long commute atau you sewa rumah dekat situ lah sewa bilik
kau tahu tak fasha fasha nak buat intern kat johor
sebab uh ya lah but she wants to be close with shami dia nak jumpa lah
so this so kita orang macam dah pernah cakap sebelum ni that if she gets an internship in johor I would I mean if we get in the around same area
ha mari mari tapi johor ni kan besar so we don't know lah
mm mm tak tahu kat mana tu jer ah when I think that
macam is I'm so scared
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship pun susah gila nak cari no no company would want
mm tapi
tapi I did see some private companies yang bagi internship not bad lah
takde I'm trying to find material for my tapi
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor bagi like
dia dia kan my old title was combining water quality dengan uh macromentoes
so I did my field work tapi since we cannot go to the lab
dia dah published dah tapi dia co author jer dia bukan the main author doctor chan lepastu dia ada data dekat tempat yang sama of macromentoes so aku kena analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper punya data
dia punya paper as a reference for my water quality part
um I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it lah tapi you know ha I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
macam aku aku try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
pastu I go back to it and then aku akan copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
pastu I try to retype it
tapi sometimes it becomes macam disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad tapi tu lah gunanya supervisor
oh laju kali ni supervisor kau laju
last sem aku rasa macam supervisor aku jer yang asik minta ya your supervisor was so quiet
sebab haritu kan kitaorang ada meeting mentor mentee kan dengan doctor chan
uhh macam on the our presentation dia cakap
the examiners all are impressed dengan kita punya presentation
pasal our presentation wise we are all macam mantul tapi when it comes to the writing
ah writing kita ada macam slack
I think must me and my feelings pun macam gitu macam
mm sometimes aku rasa macam oh my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it tapi sebenarnya okay jer
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer yang uh
ah and tapi aku rasa macam my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions dorang akan jawab
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya lah sebab kita nak tahu kan we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
ah memalukan like you feel embarrassed
yang dekat terengganu eh
did you hear about the girl kat terengganu
ah yang kawan ah
wei tu gila dah
ye lepas lepastu dia boleh Whatsapp lagi macam acting as if like nothing
eh bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke
mm macam ramai kan orang punya story macam banyak version
kesian dah like
wife dah lah sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang first kan
but it's so sad lah tapi memang
ada video evidence kan that she entered the house
mm dengan apa I think like hair in her hand
tak boleh log in kan
dah tu lah I think you just wait ah because think somewhat tak boleh tak boleh
I think someone did text the yang apa doctor jaga situ puan puan lin eh
aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh jer
kan dia macam semak
orh dia panggil okay ah
my mum doesn't ask us to help kalau dia tengah masak
ah macam after tu I usually just go and see lah tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta lah minta tolong
aku pun tapi aku kurang lah because aku kan tengok drama yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat netflix
so macam is a lot of more steps to
to watch it tapi sebab you know K drama they are so long
macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ for an hour to watch it
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people punya comments
but I think the K drama yang I watched that had a lot of err long episodes was prison playbook
itu kan I don't usually watch uh slice of life punya drama
I usually watch macam investigative atau medical tapi somehow prison playbook ni
it's interesting and dia kelakar
dia cam just a nice balance of kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar more kelakar than sedih
best tapi tu lah ada episode dia yang one one and a half hours
ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa dah lama dah
sebab you know I'm used to watching um english
english punya series english punya series paling lama pun like forty minutes jer
and then kalau comedy kalau comedy tu
lagi lah twenty minutes twenty minutes jer
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot tapi macam tak bercakap lah kan
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references macam inside jokes
ya dah you know masa tu kan dia kat dalam dia kat channel hallmark
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode baru
so macam my mum was um was very strict with this about bed times ah usually macam ten tu we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister lah my oldest sister kitaorang akan sneak out untuk tengok
I don't know ah sometimes dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar jer
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know biar jer lah macam
let us get away because sometimes kita kena belajar lah to be
especially because kitaorang kan ramai there's like six of us
ah benda macam ni is like a small thing let it go lah
I used to macam tu lah my sister and I would break um bed time
a lot sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok
baca buku yang I don't know time at first it was bagus you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot kalau kitaorang pergi big bad wolf or sale yang like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to simpan and then the worst part is that we have books yang we haven't read but we want to buy new
ah banyak jer sampai sekarang tak baca
tapi my mom dah simpan semua buku dekat my grandma's house punya store so kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam store tu but I read books on my phone now
wei kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek
anak dia pun ramai tau anak dia like wait eh one five or six tapi semua boys
uh the oldest one it's like us around the same age lah cuma the last one the last one beza dengan the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
uh the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age I think so dorang handsome tau
pernah aku pernah mimpi I was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
ya this is this is is my dream but I often memang get err
often memang get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
aku jarang tak mimpi then
yang macam banyak kali one of it I can remember is that daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil tau masa aku dah pandai drive lagi I always dream
that's like daripada dulu lagi I've been having that that one specific dream
sampai I can imagine it now
tapi actually I
I think it's interesting tapi most of the time
I don't really remember unless I betul betul put in effort untuk remember I won't remember
ah I will that's why sometimes I wake up and I'm in a bad mood is because I had a dream yang
made me ah macam you know it's a bad feeling
apa yang what was
I don't know I don't know why we are in our last semester tapi our lecturer wants to
mm mm tu lah
sabar jer lah
bedah pun did you see her tweet
no did she replied me she said there is someone who replies the list responds to the list in a group pastu aku macam oh okay aku dah tahu dah siapa
tapi dia dapat lagi sorang siapa ah
cuma dua orang tu jer
not sure I remember dua orang tu jer lagi sorang tu I tak ingat pula wait ah I see I got I send you the picture right
cause kesian
mana eh nama dia oh ni oh dia dengan okay lah
sorang tu jer lah that's like really bad
tapi tira punya group macam best cause she got
ah cas dengan tarvin
cuma cuma sorang tu jer yang macam eh sikit
alah dia start march kan
march kita start tak tak kita start intern in march
ya march sampai july
adoi so kau kena your intern has to be there lah
orh boleh kerja ke tak
ah err january tapi
dah prepare I mean they are preparing but I don't know how much they can prepare now that cannot ah selangor tengah kan
dia macam I I asked my mum because even dorang punya engagement pun they postpone
so I asked my mom if it's still uh is still like enforce at that time and tak boleh nak buat tak boleh nak buat kenduri
my mum said nikah jer lah dulu and then kenduri we can think about it later
ya tapi dorang dah ada lah dewan apa semua they have already corresponded dengan that person for now they are planning as if there's gonna be an actual wedding
aku rasa but but because
err we know the guy we are friendly with him ya I used to do it with him so aku rasa macam I don't feel like
ah apa I don't feel like I'm losing her lah sangat
ah and then he's nice I mean we argue a lot tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja jer because I think we have the same like almost similar personality
ah it's like we are both the opinionated and then kitaorang memang minat benda yang sama like we
apa semua so I can talk to him lah about and he's very friendly even to my family
mm casually talk to him so it's nice tapi macam you know my sister getting married
the last one tu supposed to be lelaki but
keluar perempuan so dia tak balance
but I'm grateful because I am right now macam paling rapat with my younger sister
because you know being the youngest she matures a lot more than kitaorang
form four lepastu tak tak matrix
dia adik aku yang last tu dia sorang jer dalam sekolah
kita orang semua dah ni dah
yang aisyah tu
pasal yang atas dia laki eh
tapi kalau kau tengok the difference between my sibilings I always post their pictures

oh tapi rambut dia sekarang dah tak tegak dah rambut dia dah leper a'ah comel gila
I don't know I miss them cause dah lama tak jumpa
best dia makan semua benda especially fruits
dia basically kau suap apa pun dia buka mulut
and then kalau macam my sister duduk atas kerusi kan pastu dia kat bawah and she's like she's standing then my sister holding a fruit and then dia akan tries so hard untuk panjat my sister's legs
adoi tapi dia dah pandai lah main and then she doesn't like cats like you
she's scared of cats kalau kitaorang video call kan and then I'll be like meow meow then dia macam huh where's that coming from where's that coming from dia takut then sekali kitaorang nak kasi dia pegang kucing dia pegang dia peluk aku kuat kuat gila she's so scared

bila kau start kerja baru ini fourteen december berapa minggu jer
excited the place is near your house kenapa tak mana kerja aku cause di sini sia ada macam some kind of progression
kau dah buat berapa lama di tempat ini wow that's fast ah
so moving back into like your um cakap siapa tadi
bila dia orang boleh masuk singapore
apa tu barang fashion ke barang household rumah ke barang fashion jenama fashion orang keluar masuk kedai kenapa apa seh
orang beli bag warna-warna buat apa
so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so bodoh of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
that was so bodoh of me
later you help me out tolong aku I seriously feel so bodoh realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
really really except for those who are working shifts and dekat the
finally after so long of working shifts penat seh kerja shift
bagus berharap kau boleh stay kat this job lama I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down ke apa ke and it's always like unexpected suddenly
dia cakap besok semua try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed eh I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but I think my weakness is makan asyik pergi makan jer as much as nak buat melipat kan macam need to plan for the week
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth ah I think kena makan for like tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk the
fifty dollars for the um the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses punya routine to relieve menses tu
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments lah this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what lagi dua bulan
but but dia cakap kalau boleh makan more sayur-sayur but sayur pun kalau bagus like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food pedas-pedas tak boleh you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat pedas punya makanan because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet susu pun sama but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house lah we all cook this interesting dish lah so it tasted like those kung pao chicken so instead of using santan the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use macam make up for it macam it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually kan I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based um their kidney macam feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle dia kan macam quite a high stage diabetic lah then he had to err inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like macam too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that cara nak masak pula because we are so used to like masakan melayu masakan wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs what other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some buah-buahan
too manis yes but some buah got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
nasi I makan nasi basmati so
penat because kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat three thirty ah menahan menahan taxi
I was stuck at home apa tu actually aku aku mahu see yang tu juga mm mmhmm
I know right you always take the bus early or late oh earlier lama dia then what did you do take train
creamy meatball are there any other sayur inside your bowl
wow mana ada ini oh I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place ah I don't like the inside ah so busuk cause I sat near the kitchen so sempit
benda leceh saya nak buat actually
buat basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
nak perlu impact oh habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia
kan lepas tu dia cakap macam kind of um okay no
masa itu masa itu emas time is golden
she ask me that you haven't kahwin that time I thought you kahwin already then she ask kat apa
she say that time I fall down only I kahwin next year aku kau
want to be what dia cakap
who's that siapa tanya
you have to plan lah all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something ah you are so convinced to buy the item wah the person say bagus ah this one okay ah I try also
maybe they are selective lah yes yang macam cakap boleh bagus
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food makan sedap jer then what about those like unhealthy
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch asyik-asyik makan sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew apa I mean it must be strong in kimchi flavour
kenyang tak why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
it wasn't that bad but okay lah yes ramen spot is the best like kat mana opposite lau pa sat kasih area gyudon
poke bowl I don't know salmon what did you eat at lau pa sat yang dekat lau pa sat itu is it like the soy based or the miso based or
I saw that I saw the person macam mana dia apa sushi cake eh the salmon cake savoury cake savoury sushi cake yes is like a decorated cake but it's like all salmon mentaiko all savoury I feel we should have that for our next birthday
it's filling ah kenyang ah
pucailok the long bean with like asam I don't like the corn just the long bean and you eat it with the you know scrambled egg like the side nasi you how about you
um fifty betul
so maknanya kalau uh kalau if you yang in ten years time memang you want to be in an area yang ada laut yang ada greenery where
kalau untuk saya for me eh I think eh
I would like to live in my own lab atau garage
and maybe sebelah would be my like lab apparatus ke apa ke
so if I have my own lab I would probably uh maybe add a telescope atau like some meeting devices so that I can
mmhmm betul
katanya if say let's say you were
martial arts gitu
uh any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and um I think it it it gives me like macam
yang satu orang ni uh she was actually uh she was actually trapped in a spaceship
computed her body into into a technological uh into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone ah orang sendiri tau so
so the boss memang memang jahat ah gilanya orang
like their their image you know what I mean faham tak ya so an image of them self you mean nak ah macam
ah ada fit body atau good looks
I think I agree on that lah sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun eh tapi kalau macam if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then buat apa lah
ya so I think for me kalau ada fit body is more satisfying sebab
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world lah sebab without without health actually um you can be bedridden and even the the cost of uh
so macam I think health is very important lah sebab without health memang you tak boleh buat much lah you can't do much actually
kena start awal lah
so I think one kalau pot from having a fit body eh
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind sebab sekarang memang as you can see eh mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth err among the working adults and among um teens
cara holistic lah
I think mental health also like uh stems from other external factors macam maybe overwhelming of
school work atau
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have lah that they experience so um like if you can see like the education system kat singapore sekarang memang very uh
it's very intense lah so like what macam
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and macam memang I've been schooling ah and I think macam there's a lot of
but tu memang
but it doesn't really appease them so I think macam apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but uh everything has been changing and revolutionised
uh it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless sebab apa tau if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you macam just just kasi semua on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
macam apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics lah and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion bila macam
macam susah lah kan
mm okay so contohnya like for now eh we are in the twentieth twenty first century
cuba like for example eh you ternampak a time capsule
I think that's pun what I would really macam really cherish enjoy
I don't know maybe zaman rasulullah atau dark ages ah cause um basically the dark ages were macam a period of time
the macam
rolab and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science bila there's this two brothers
I think it's very interesting to see macam
the the progression during that period of times sebab sebab during that time memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan idea macam gitu
during the golden age and I find it really interesting sebab how their mind
even in engineering and science and uh it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's um macam kita jarang tengok ah
dalam dunia ni sekarang tau most of the time kan kadang-kadang macam contohnya eh I have to um contohnya I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine uh philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once lah but I think macam ya I think it'll be very interesting lah kalau you can like learn
tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita just go far
sebab ilmu tu mana-mana and you can use for ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu
ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa as long as kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik and I think it will be very fruitful lah
um duit ke rumah ke
or war actually can be stopped cause technically um itu lah kalau boleh share but technically like uh world hunger among there are many um palestinians
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID eh macam susah seh orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang now orang eh actually tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada no access to macam
so I think um having a family really macam
and kalau ada suami I would be able to
find solace in him cause memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan kan so I think having a spouse would be very interesting lah
akhlak yang baik lah
macam I can feel you lah I think having uh having status
even if you want me to have good akhlak
tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal okay kita tak
hancur tau
akhlak is more valuable lah than intellect
akhlak lah actually even if you have your own
buat yang baik lah
you tak ada gunanya
maybe like um what do you think if you macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam superpower
kalau you ada superpower like you nak jadi apa kalau what what what will you like to have right now
kalau ada barang nak kemas inshallah lah
kalau you know I rasa
sebab kalau I dapat teleport kan
I takkan lambatnya cause I'm like always late kalau dapat teleport then macam on on the speed of light or even faster than that uh just like be wherever I want to be just teleport tak tak payah nak passport semua so I think that's very cool ah kalau kalau kalau dapat teleport lah
I think the current technology memang tak boleh lah unless kita ada transporter macam kat star trek ke but of course not lah
tapi contohnya eh kalau macam now's the kalau cause sekarang memang is in progress lah what what do you think of
phones pun is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
sekarang google jer
I think okay lah maybe salah saya juga sebab phone tu memang it serves like an educational purpose lah
ya and the entertainment purpose untuk zaman sekarang
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans ada this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things tapi macam they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very um like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think agaknya also I feel it's on the good side lah because
important I think apart from that I think macam humans should actually still take care of their parents and macam don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and contohnya macam
uh like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then macam mana seh kan
ada limit to it
I think one dia macam pun very subjective lah sebab kita orang tak tahu like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
I think ya technically macam you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world macam india they are very overpopulated kalau kita dah ada robot lagi mana nak letak seh human ni so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult lah sebab you have to find a contingency plan sebab memang dunia ni maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting lah to actually to predict and cause nowadays memang
humans dorang betul-betul kena
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even macam greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see lah sebab um some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
hello hi how are you I nak minta tolong sikit lah boleh tak
tu lah my parents nak makan nasi padang ah but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best nasi padang in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like hajjah maimunah you know but other than that cause hajjah maimunah I went went there just now today they're not open
mm tak kisah lah
I think I think I know I think I know yang mana satu we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried sana sedap eh
oh is that type lah I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that kena eh tak payah eh
oh sebelas this is for lunch lah
ya nasi padang I think the most of the places jarang ah eh I think but there's one place I don't know you pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa eh nama dia I think it's called sari ratu you pernah pergi sana buka I think like pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka tau
I actually have no idea but I pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu
dia punya lauk masih still looks fresh lah tak tak rasa macam
since pagi ke apa maybe dia orang masak petang juga but okay lah kalau in case you keluar dengan your family or your friends
tekak you nak makan nasi padang you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road lah but it's it's quite near the kampong glam area like baghdad street or something like that
oh apa nama tempat dia eh
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall kalau pergi sana I think
okay lah I think I will try that that what minang place there
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing err my parents dia orang nak makan sana cause just nice lah think after that I boleh ke nak jalan around the area beli kain-kain ke apa-apa
that that area got a lot of kedai-kedai macam gitu kan jual kain lah jual buku-buku lah jual baju lah carpet lah
tak tahu eh belum ada plan but around that area got a few malls kan
for the house I don't know like pinggan mangkuk ke apa think whatever ya lah
dia orang nak beli I think nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak I think can bring to think bugis junction quite near
ya lah I think everywhere lah the same but now if possible duduk rumah more ya cause if you have to go out also yang no choice then kalau nak keluar you buy whatever you need to buy you beli dah beli dah makan ke apa then terus balik then kalau you nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue nak kena tunggu and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now banyak orang buat gitu lah tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa you nak beli kadang-kadang you beli online you tengok colour ni
nanti datang colour lain
kita kita boleh hantar balik kan dia orang boleh
tak boleh refund ke
wah ya lah and gambar you tak boleh cannot
trust kadang-kadang
then in the end what happened did you makan the nasi jer
I think I think got banyak lah I dengar complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
untuk self pick up you know you order then you pergi sana sendiri you you you
you pick up the food sendiri then I order at first they say the food should be ready dua puluh minit then I dah sampai sana I tunggu almost one hour baru the food siap
that one lagi self pick up kalau I tunggu dia delivery I think mungkin more than one hour but this was back then lah during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think semua orang order
pernah order grab takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah kan
tu lah nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup then bila order tunggu satu jam ya lah that time I I ada satu friend pun dia ceritakan dia order I think err mothers' day I think
ah dia order pun dia order err
dia dah order tunggu lama-lama the punya app cakap waiting for driver nak dekat dua puluh minute in the end tak ada dia dah order order order tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap cancel dah tunggu twenty minutes uh huh
day ada orang dah advance order the day before to arrive for example eh dia cakap you order for today esok dia suruh deliver for makan tengah hari
pukul dua belas ah on the next day lah they advance order lah then when it comes on the day half an hour before dia orang cancel dia punya order
orang orang nak buat celebration dia orang buat macam gini tu lah
ya lah but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault lah it's all the the the the restaurants kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana then restaurant yang cakap cancel but dia orang tak fair lah then the driver the rider kena marah
I think maybe for safety juga lah I think kalau satu not not dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver lepas tu orang tu cakap eh dalam eh inside my my packet got
for example lah dia cakap I see hair then they complain kat restaurant nanti restaurant will cakap eh but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant dia orang lah pasal dia orang yang pack makanan so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy kerja dia is just to send so kalau
ya ya lah you can see tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard err I got one friend kawan I satu err whenever dia order
kasih dia orang tip kasih cash ya lah but sometimes a'ah dia kasih extra like maybe two dollar ke lima dollar
I tak tahu lah I think so but I think maybe
maybe dia orang order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya lah but good lah then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot what kalau dapat tip and not say
kerja dia orang senang ya lah senang as in cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang customer complain lah customer marah so I think once in a while ada orang
kasih tip macam gitu
kasih dorang macam motivate dia orang lah at least ada juga orang yang
baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah jer
tu lah cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada deliver kan bagus eh tapi I cari semua tak ada
tapi nasi ambeng ada deliver tapi nasi padang I think tak ada
kesian lah
dia tak ada offered to refund ke apa-apa that's not good actually
cannot lah the customer dia orang bayar apa
so nanti esok you nak ikut tak I nak pergi cycling mm
I think kita dah quite long time kita tak pergi changi beach lah
takpe lah we go kita pergi early lah morning you know I mean by by tengah hari we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya lah this quite some time I pun dah lama tak tak ride my bicycle
you punya bicycle masih ada tak then okay lah is it the same one that you beli dulu
cause recently I think that day I I I ada beli I went to the bicycle shop lah to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet dah dah koyak dia punya strap I was talking to the owner of the shop dia cakap sekarang like everyday dia jual like maybe
I think so cause that time dia orang tak boleh
wherever lah tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang lah tak boleh pergi shopping lah
I think dia baru baru buka lah aiya maybe I don't know tak tahu eh
maybe lah I think they they the the new movies I think maybe kalau rasa
you rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi
tengok maybe they wait lah they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
ya there's no apa
esok esok kita pergi to changi after that after that kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak mm
okay kita pergi the famous one lah kat sana yang changi
I think the I don't know I think maybe the sambal lah okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
esok kita boleh try lah kalau kalau kalau makcik
beli I senyum kalau pakcik then you senyum okay think just nice lah so we go cycling then go nasi lemak ya then after that we head back
tu dah macam yang kat bangkok kadang-kadang boleh panas
abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu ya
I think dia punya macam
ya lah I think dia punya mungkin usually like that dia punya dia punya what you call that dia punya longkang ah dia punya drainage sumbat of course lah then kalau dia punya rain was like that day
pagi sampai petang what six seven hours ya lah
if the rain that much then the drain sumbat mana air nak pergi
ya lah tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang those landed property
okay lah but this kind of weather I think susah nak predict kalau you tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan or the other way that day pagi hujan lebat then dia stop
I think dia orang also just tikam jer lah
maybe it's the other side maybe you kat east side tampines maybe kat choa chu kang ke jurong yang hujan right mm kadang-kadang like like that what not the whole singapore
uh oh kesiannya then
mm mm that means ya lah lama lah
I think most of the the what you call it apa dia panggil dengue hot spot eh dah banyak dulu I think tak banyak tempat I think near my place also kat pasir ris ada there there there's err
one case opposite my block mm ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum dengar then terus dia pergi luar dia check dia punya pasu-pasu bunga make sure tak ada because kalau the officers datang
they can summon you kan I think ya so kalau you have like tak lah
I tak tahu I think they come random lah it's either that or either that or I don't know eh mungkin kalau ada neighbour yang complain tak tahu kalau the neighbours suspect you you tak
maybe lah maybe dia orang they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe dia orang take like a a sample
of the water something like dia orang bawa
dia orang punya lab agaknya dia orang check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back lah they take some sample of the air bawa balik to lab then run dia orang test agaknya lah but ya lah sometimes they will check what even if they cannot see kalau dia orang tengok let's say rumah you
ada ada plants ada potted plants then dia punya air dia tengok eh macam tak tukar they will tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air do you change everyday because by right you kena tukar so at least if
happen to be the nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau you tukar hari-hari
then dapat dapat
but you you get to buang dia punya telur apa ah kalau let's say you
tak tukar I pun tak tahu I pernah baca I don't know lah maybe takes a few days lah maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the nyamuk
telur to tukar lah so kalau you leave it for that long then maybe you might kena summon lah kalau dia check so that time my my mum dengar dia terus check
ya lah kat rumah pun semua tukar at least everyday lah
ya lah so kita
kalau ya lah because the the like what's the
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang
tu lah
kalau you kena gigit pun mm
so I think if you if you rasa macam you kena gigit dengan mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor lor dia punya mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then dua tiga hari lepas tu you demam I think better go doctor you check
ah tak ada dia
mm then that one can can can lead to complications lah kalau tak kalau biasa punya after some time it will it will get better ya lah but leceh lah you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you kena dengue
then you cannot see what kalau dia nak gigit you dia pun tak tak warning
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day dia punya the number of cases for COVID lah was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
these countries I guess because dia orang punya
ya then some of them might not be even kat hospital you know
ya ya lah because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers tak boleh kerja kan
semua orang first time pun tak tahu ya but
foreign workers was was told to quarantine eh quarantine themselves duduk kat dalam dormitory tu kalau I tak tahu rumah you you tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat my office pun sama dia punya
dah tak terjaga ya lah that shows
the foreign workers are important only time time macam gini then people realise oh ya ya lah this during this difficult
period you boleh tengok macam orang yang what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like macam those tadi kita complain pasal grab food driver and all that ya kalau you imagine kalau dia orang tak ada that time circuit breaker you nak makan macam mana
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch baru dapat
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody bersihkan know your around your area under your block all that
ya lah but tempat your workplace how you still going to work or
when that day I think I was at the area lah raffles down there lah you can see I was there lunch time macam tak ada orang mm can see that there is definitely different lah you see the lunch time crowd macam more like a ghost town I would say
including my my tempat kerja pun I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen lah sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause sekarang dah berapa tiga eh dah tiga since march dah lima bulan dah
working from home still masih survive apa so why do they need to like rent office mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap business jalan
kalau you kat rumah pun at least you save transport right if ya lah our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
maybe the only thing yang you spend more I rasa mungkin is just your utilities lor
kan bila at home
if not usually you are at home malam-malam and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven hari-hari
because bila dulu time sebelum all these terjadi orang semua nak keluar so sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah
ya betul
iya lah mana dia orang nak pergi
airline pun even the airline nak pergi pun the the the I think the government doesn't allow
kat singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though kecil still got a lot of places if you want to explore
give them more things to do if all the businesses tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat
takkan nak tengok jer eh but everything
ya I think like hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa
ya kalau tak it's not like kita
we said what the wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun the cinemas belum buka so
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new macam wayang I mean filem-filem yang baru mungkin more people will will go kalau tak ada orang not interested ya lah at least they have entertainment at home or more
your ya but I think no choice lah sekarang semua kena gitu
ya like dulu pun macam apa tu during bulan puasa orang nak bayar what you call that the zakat fitrah ya but now also everything online what dulu people would queue at the
masjid you know mm even
the yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya I think all the woodlands jurong I think they were I forgot I think tak salah I ada sepuluh ya ten different places where they have the celebration lah ya
ya kalau dia orang buat dekat the same place then more people will go there what so I think they have to lah to to elakkan orang go to like the padang or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people tak akan you know berkumpul at the tempat which is better lah everything lah like err I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
ya lah cannot lah some more lagi that kind of event I think you're talking about
saw got people post gambar-gambar yang the river singapore river lah the some of the beaches the sea looks
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi and then kita kat sini I mean we don't experience that that lah but for me personally I tengok bila during circuit breaker tak banyak kereta you can see like you said bila kita pergi jogging kat luar ke apa macam
lagi fresh dia punya air tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also lah that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
apa yang yang I nak cakap you tak payah spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah
hobby baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu lah eh
main gitar bernyanyi lah
ya kalau if this thing didn't happen you you'd takkan tahu yang all this thing you boleh buat so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side lah or what
kita complain complain hari-hari pagi petang malam pun you complain also the thing will still remain then takkan today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
true ya but I guess people are just people dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak complain dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap right
macam ni lah government government kasih duit orang complain government tak kasih duit pun orang complain
betul kita cakap orang pun I think kadang-kadang I pun complain juga
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you nak kena tengok you tak boleh degil you know nak dengar cakap you jer
complain but at the end of the day I think especially kita kat sini kat singapore I think kita still not as bad as you compare to other countries
you can't even I mean you can maybe you boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin you boleh beli
beras all those barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin
satu minggu sekali but still singapore I think
itu pun ada orang kan that time berapa a lot of people masuk facebook masuk stomp tak nak pakai then kena kena all the officers suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal
ya by right bukan susah benda tu nak ya lah macam like
I see them tu lah that time
government kasih free leh nak minta dia orang pakai
I mean there's a there's a there's a feeling lah rasa macam
kaya apa dia orang ya lah
kan tapi dia blonde
ini bukan yang ni both fiction

at first I thought like bedek lah ini macam global myth ah tapi macam then a lot of people was really cause there is no confirmation you you hear a lot of the story on the internet
bersunat ah
can semua boleh work from home
ah nampak lama sangat
cause turkey turkey has always prided itself on being a a circular state like they are they are muslim majority but they are also like very very proud they are very proud of their progressiveness like err women don't need to wear the the tudung and ya lah I mean it's good but
the ones who are actually voicing out are not the saudi arabians when ya which is very sad the one who's making noise is the progressive one you know turkey turkey is the one that eh dia ini macam macam mahu but they are the ones actually advocating for change so I don't know I it's so messed up
macam brotherhood lah
oh he got to K so he he got tahan because he take itself lah you that's the border the demarcation then you of course he gonna get in trouble they cross the thing you got the
I mean kalau pergi mana-mana
I tak cerita sebanyak kalau nak pergi mana tapi yang penting err
if I were to go travel I I got a plan like I mean not so plan but if like if anybody got any suggestion eh why not we go to this place pergi tempat ni lah macam best jer ah I just ikut jer ah you punya orang kita lah how about you
and winter will be interesting because tak pernah experience salji macam salji mesti lah sejuk kan tapi from what I know ah
tengok pokok-pokok ah pokok lupa nama dia tapi it's pink in colour merah jambu pokok tu tengok macam dekat bila kita jalan ambil gambar pun cantik apa kan so cantik jer pokok tu I think I like pretty stuff lah I mean who doesn't like pretty stuff like when you take photo it will look good on you so ya
what's the name for the ya so I'll bring them to kampung glam because of I remember masa time dulu ah sekolah rendah sekolah menengah kan mesti ada field trip like they will bring us to a few places in singapore then we can just enjoy right so I remember going to kampung glam
and masa tu time tu sekolah rendah lah dia orang bawa kita pergi ah
it was very interesting at first sight because ah I mean kita kalau macam mana nak cakap ah kita orang melayu pun kadang-kadang pun tak pergi tempat yang kita punya culture where where it is what so it's like when I go there
it's interesting because I found interesting games macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main ah macam gasing or chapteh lagi ada five stones there are five stones
so ya I think I am more attracted dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu lah oh ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam lah macam-macam permainan lah macam permainan dulu-dulu I think I'm
I would not say I grew up watching it lah how how would I explain it dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok drama korea macam cuma drama melayu macam dekat channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so I I bet everybody knows this so masa tu macam ah eh tengok ah boys over
flowers best tau cerita dia ah cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya then nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni then I was like
oh okay mula dengar macam oh okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
like people using fake profiles macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu then orang mesti macam eh I want tinggi wah cik lawa ah buat kawan ah kan
aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau I'm here for you like you know
macam dalam dunia ni itu kan macam movie ah tu kan based on
non-fiction what so it's like bila ada movie macam gini macam wah macam dia orang pakai macam magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
three hours is because uh they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture what ya when making movies lah but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it ah it dia ada macam crime crime scene kat dalam tu
so macam never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
teletubbies punya patung I mean I tak collect banyak lah I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is ah
own macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya character dia orang ada macam barang macam tinky-winky ada handbag kalau dipsy dia ada topi dia kan then ah laa-laa dia ada dia punya orange orange bounce ball
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so macam macam spongebob pun unik juga pasal spongebob berkawan dengan uh dengan apa dengan starfish they call it right ya dia berkawan dengan starfish kawan dengan uh sotong
mesti sudah tentu titanic siapa
siapa yang dengar nama titanic tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal kan cerita pasal kapal
cinta wah that was the first movie also right yang very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting eh yang ini oh I got I got a question for you um if you have three wishes what would you wish for
err terutama saya suka I suka makan I suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan kan I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
food also is something like kita boleh
kita boleh macam explore you can go like
macam try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
uh it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind pasal yang
kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir kan dia macam dia diam jer jadi if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking apa dalam minda dia macam wah
I can maybe like let's say nak buat kawan kita because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people lah if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like oh okay dia ni rasa macam gini-gini maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind what so
I think I mean like that's part of uh your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam
yang kecil-kecil lah you know tapi mana ada yang macam
and like tapi apa-apa pun in the end it's all you know it's all up to you lah actually
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like masuk kedai jer ah nak beli baju ni lah ah kena bayar tak payah bayar okay
I mean just bawa balik I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean biasa lah sometimes kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli eh nanti guna ke tak tak guna eh tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna so
be a healing process because like you plant berkebun I mean lepas tu you tanam any pokok ah any bunga atau pokok yang yang favourite lah kan tanam then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
tanam maybe like you can tanam fruits buah-buahan sayur-sayuran I got a neighbour ah ah my neighbour likes to plant ah
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also macam
ada macam tanam cili padi habis you nak cili padi daun kari daun kari for me it's very common daun kari then ada apa lagi eh macam bunga-bunga
bunga rose I don't know if it's common bunga rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of uh food what
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek kan macam
kena bahan ini lah bahan itu lah tapi nak dia punya process the process of making it is is very hard what so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
ah favourite lagu genre genre genre macam genre melayu ke genre ah sembarang-sembarang apa-apa genre kalau apa-apa genre
err if I were to say well we both like K pop but if genre lain would be macam
genre lagu-lagu pop lagu pop pop like lagu
oh cakap pasal lagu pop macam teringat kalau lagu ah you know pop yeh yeh it's the malays well it I always like to bring back to to the old times then like I say my friend see me as like ah throwback throwback kind of person ya lagu pop yeh yeh is
masa tu memang masa tu kita sekolah rendah eh sekolah rendah kita dah dengar lagu pop yeh yeh that was that was the band that I think that was the first I forgot what's the band's name I forgot what's the band's name but that was the first
ah malay band that I listen to at that point of time I think it's because of my sister like she also listens to this kind of like ya but ya pop yeh yeh ya it's like in dari korea tu biasa lah kan ya for me like lagu irama melayu would be the pop melayu lah they call it pop pop
live music pernah pergi dengan
band ah apa nama band tu westlife
alah boleh lupa pula ah band nama tu ah I pergi dengan my kakak kita pergi because my ni minat uh westlife sebenarnya so it was more meaningful and especially because it falls on her birthday this was back
uh it was last year ya it was last year ya basically it was last year we went for this concert ah this westlife concert it was a very that was the second time I went for concert yang live usually I tak pergi pasal I
ah satu duit kan very ah macam mahal kan tapi like this time round um my sister decided like me and the price is affordable so I was like eh you like this band why not we go also ya so was very
oh ugh my talking about shopping just now right uh fashion style I'm more to a casual side macam santai-santai tak ada anything very dramatic atau macam I suka pakai simple simple just a simple one like
pakai T-shirt seluar
err kasut tak kisah lah kasut ke sandal ah tu jer I'm I'm that type of I don't go for very like dramatic of like like ya I rarely wear accessories too but only recently
so you know me you know my collections I just decided to cause it was it was unique and cool because pasal it was handmade tak pernah nampak macam susah nak nampak ah kat luar tu orang jual macam handmade earring macam
I'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense macam colour
ya I I don't go for macam colour colour macam
macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang you know what I mean right macam you look at wow it's so it's so bright on you like I don't wear bright colours I'm not that that kind
and warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde kan dalam global mesti ada kan so hitam is I think
hitam like is the is the main ah but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about eh ya
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight macam macam mana nak cakap eh kita jumpa orang tu first time then kejar I'm not terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta I mean I
ah faham faham ya ya ada orang pun fikir
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people mesti tengok macam wah dia ni kacak ah dia ni macam handsome jer ah tapi tu ah fikir-fikir balik ah kita like would you really
alamak okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking teh O ais limau dengan syrup syrup limau ya alamak if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup limau dengan teh O ice I will pilih teh O ice
I mean syrup syrup manis I mean I teh pun manis lah kan tapi teh lagi macam lagi like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting wah
it's just mi apa noodle
kalau sound uh
actually any sound tu I takde idea tapi macam if you were to ask me if ah I tak pergi where what is ah my favourite place to go I will pick uh
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers bunga basically like I said lah bunga cantik like I really really really
you know my favourite ah bunga matahari bunga matahari is my kesukaan bunga matahari tu lah macam every time I tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia
the colour dia colour macam cerah kan colour kuning kan dia macam what ah it it will lift up your mood
to to plant and to jaga macam kalau tanam tanam bunga rose tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena ah selalu
kasi dia air so gotta give it enough sunlight if if not it will it will not grow grow well lah from what I know rose but if I would would want to plant it's like I say
bunga matahari I nak tanam pokok bunga matahari ya
plants and looking at ah flowers bloom bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak eh
pokok eh bunga cantiknya
ah it will make us macam it will make

it's like totally malam-malam tak ada benda nak makan kan then you just
ah you really masak maggi ke masak apa
but sederhana lah you know
just biasa punya

it's a good opportunity to get married ya ya alamak nak kahwin nak kahwin should I kahwin no lah it's okay lah
twenty eight so my parents cakap ah
no lah also no pressure for me cause I prefer kalau boleh nak habiskan sekolah dulu then

some more my cousins semua kat malaysia kan so they cannot really come in to singapore
ah tak apa lah you know just make do with what we have right now lah you know
ya he's gonna get engaged then next year then married lah tengok macam mana lah because
he he's the kind to prefer kalau
all my cousins ada
and most of my cousins semua kat malaysia so tengok dulu lah macam mana
kalau phase three they allow us to you know
I feel like malaysia sekarang macam
dapat pergi malaysia fuh full on
pergi usually if I go there I pergi mana eh
johor bahru yang
ah pergi johor bahru ah dekat apa tu the mall nearby
ah city square mall also pun kat situ pun ya
murah-murah pe barang
ya you normally ya ya you through the woodlands ke tuas side depends
boleh lah kalau
right now kalau kalau boleh right I just want to not wear the mask cause it's so freaking rimas
kakak famous
I feel you I feel you okay ah there are also macam there are also perks to wearing masks ah like you don't have to tegur
all the time like you see people right you don't have to tegur what because you don't know they don't realise that it's you you know
ya tak
ya tak perasan lah
bila nak snow eh
bila nak snow ah
panas sia
so right now you still cari kerja lah
so right now you still cari kerja lah
oh okay lah uh right now pun I feel that
ramai orang yang tak ada kerja they can apply for this um
I pun ada apply I pun ada apply for other jobs but they also gave me the same reasonings like oh you are overqualified or you are underqualified
the macam for certain positions they will say macam um
tak ada hal panggil hal ah
right now pun aiya susah lah as long as I feel that kalau dapat kerja pun ambil jer lah eh
ya lah tengok condition dia lah you know some people they just
so kalau pay is not good
oh kerja apa tu
cause I applied for teaching macam english you know languages lah basically
ah macam tak faham ah I just
tapi ya ya papaya lah you know just
leceh lah it's just part of the routine right sekarang
ya lah it's always like that lah the management sometimes when you tak when you don't have a good management right

she say like word for word macam gitu
was minta kena sepak sia
ah dah burn ah tak payah lah

either work from home or face to face ah I preferred tapi
also depending lah like cause I'm doing project right like I said then macam
projects so basically uh kalau ada apa apa
ya ya you know the kalau
macam ugh malas ah it's better to do face to face ah you know like lincah can just
whatever lah right now pun
so ya I know kat sini quite bising
um right now kat sini ada renovation my area sini
it's a bit suffocating kalau you stay at home work from home
rimas ah
but I think kalau nak kalau nak kahwin sekarang pun macam
go the proper way kena ada majlis perkahwinan
that one that one I don't know sia I don't know I don't actually know how it works kalau your partner is a non-muslim
I tak tahu seh ada benda macam gini
no I don't tak tak ingat pun you ada cakap
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents kalau your parents ada pressure you
your parents ada pressure you
kan kalau you are studying normally you just focused on studying right
so I I tend to neglect kalau ada
get the wedding cause some people they get married first kahwin dulu ah then
ya I just nak keluar rumah you know have your own
he cannot really move into my place also because I think kecoh ah
I think kecoh ah
I don't prefer kecoh

uh it's cramped kecoh
my brother pun nak kahwin kan end of december I I hope
cause like kecoh
the house is just cramped ah sekarang my house ada enam orang
is those it's not even petty crime it's just weird crime macam
bawa passport
kena bawa passport
actually ya pretty I think because jurong my area jurong west kan uh banyak
some more there's not much um my area there is just macam industrial there's not much activity going around
it's quite scary lah kalau balik malam-malam then
ya then ada juga uh pencuri which is
then I jalan balik
I told my parents ah then my parents macam cause my parents are in the
ya my parents on gila lah you know they are all in all these
eh seram pe
it's always like that you always get kerja somewhere far away from your house
my office work my main office is at town what so I'm like ah malas
malas the crowd no
my office situ is like
so I uh it's crowded lah especially kalau in the morning kan nak ambil public transport
fact that you feel like seram ah especially if you go home late at night
you you can you can stay at jurong east if I'm not wrong jurong east ada
ya certain areas macam um
you know uh malls or ke apa
like I I also had the same mentality as you macam um
wait so right now dia
dia just kerja ah I mean sorry dia just sekolah lah
wah kecoh
oh but then that semester break is I think is just macam cari
you know bulanan
oh sekolah uni
no belum
okay ah biasa jer how about you
oh banyaknya
so um we actually met at bugis so then we went to walk around at bugis junction first because we want cause uh we want cause we met late afternoon so we decided to not we decided he ajak me go solat at masjid sultan
so we went to walk around first then around me six fifty then we made our way to masjid sultan then you know now got the safe entry staff so we cannot really um masuk early kan so we had to waste our time first before we go to masjid then
then um like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend meninggal
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know orang tu baru meninggal kan
aku tak expect kau to be like
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him macam
like at that point in time aku tak cakap apa-apa cause
honestly that last conversation kan he dia minta maaf cause um dia tahu yang apa macam
he he knows he's in the wrong ah kirakan then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself pe so I included my own thoughts about that matter ah
over that maybe my words or something I don't know lah but it's just like macam I feel like he could have
if kalau dia datang balik kan
I don't know kalau jodoh jodoh
it's not fair or tak boleh ah macam what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so
yes ya and also macam
when I think bila fikir balik kan
um datang balik pun
if really then I'll give in ah but if not then malas ah
philosopher tak menjadi

in dalam kepala aku kan aku macam
aku tak akan baik cause
but eh sampai mak aku risau seh mak aku was like

I don't know how to explain it it's just macam

but like kan dia macam buat macam barang-barang
barunya system dia buat barang-barang lebih menarik
ah mana mana kita boleh menerima seratus dua lima
apa apa kau punya plan
oh it was so much fun after a long time I tak pergi kerja then went back so met um
um macam in a small group lah instead of last time one big group
group lah but no more number of days dia panjang ah um james was the in charge ah it's quite fun lah
screening right they are prepared awal you know I mean normal
kerja dari rumah more relax they says ah then they say oh then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
tadi tadi one is from um one's from mycrone
if nenek pekik-pekik
because I told bibik to give anxiety pill early
I think nenek is more on anxiety rather than depression ah because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
ah so I guess it's more anxiety than dari depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit termenung thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then uh there is
and she started want to pray then she ah tak yakin that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
not um it's quite to say lah couple of days when she was at the peak um which is really really very I should say macam mana very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
her macam worse or ataupun dia punya um paling tinggi lah dia punya mengamuk atau dementia punya err
so as what you say lah maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like macam quite ah quite more peaceful um
um more macam if she she shouted yell and err
but not much and then err at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming ataupun nak minta keluar from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just redha jer lah ikhlas and redha
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone itu sahaja um from last time she doesn't want to be alone
hantu are not human
she's very garang human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing lah she's very scared the rest I don't think so lah macam people she's not afraid of lah none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
of course lah unless she says like stupid things lah then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans lah merepek jer accounting but cute lah she answer
apa ni merepek nak balik ah which is funny lah
macam gitu lah
what's your name how many children you have lepas tu dia tanya
all the personal things lah then tanya
um past then present then tanya in between so
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up lah so she macam ada rest and then after that continue again um
ya but the progression is like um the progression is actually macam okay lah people
um which macam mana nak cakap eh ah depression lah maybe lah
difficult for me to say lah because it involved brain and then like nenek they said that some of her brains already stroke
educate the caregiver itu lah
because dia orang ni sooner or later they going to be
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say ah eh I thought you want to err pass motion or you want to kencing and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that um
um professional ataupun ah
nurses yang
well educate about all this macam well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is err no the better lah no way I'm quite difficult lah this this this this dementia or old aging punya err problem eh it's going to hit the world
the youngsters educate the youngsters ataupun macam make it a point that
or anak mesti nak kena jaga parents atau there is this centre ataupun help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
kita kena ada this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
eh tak baik say dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik say tak nak jaga mak bapa dia
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that macam kita nak abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say eh tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that ataupun european europe country atau the america they find that sending the
dalam islam okay kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan a must
kind of macam err educate ataupun information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
macam preparation for the future for the future or
I think so because but mm but I don't think so they take nowadays they dia orang macam tak encouraged but they are
they have this macam mana nak cakap eh dia tak encourage tapi dia dah dah ready
I did in this ah they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you dah tua you tak nak tinggal dengan anak you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a um estate where a lot of amenities macam vast or or supermarket doctors dekat dekat and then err the whole building dia orang pun ada macam err
how should I say macam dia orang ada
clubhouse lah something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but dia orang tak macam
macam apa eh
have campaign ataupun macam kasih
tahu dengan public no they just do it you want it
okay this uh we have it you know tapi dia tak ada encouragement ataupun dia kasih macam I find lah macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
an idea ataupun dia come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system mah
they don't they they say said very err how should I say uh tak macam besar tau like very big macam siapa tahu tahu lah siapa tak tahu tak tahu lah that kind of thing
so it's kind of like macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu
then they are they are well informed otherwise takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang be bothered takde orang tahu lah um that's the problem lah
kita tak macam based we are free religious
other activity macam ah more of entertainment entertainment and activity lah you know of ataupun
old folk citizen soon or not far also but err right now people at my age I should say ataupun people at pak age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
atau plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both ada compromise both boleh plan sama-sama and both also boleh you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
oh what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the dah tak boleh juga
I kena orang then I know I don't want to burden my children um
kau orang share cari orang jaga mak that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday ah one of my children must visit me ah macam gitu lah
ah ataupun nanti cuti come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a macam sekarang ni eh banyak karang ni I see like macam my girlfriends
are people that I know ah they have mom which go every week go to every are of err anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu I I don't know whether is it a good idea because mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin is it
oh at this stage eh dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit is it good for her to change
the second option is so much better because dia tak ada burden others because you see ah
anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul ah children wants to but you must also remember anak-anak not the spouse ada anak I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then um anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya
peace also it's like um mak ni macam jadi macam you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you faham tak
unless you macam okay let's see lah this is
ah what I think it's good it's like macam let's say I ada empat anak I ada dua belas cucu something like that dua belas cucu enam yang very um macam dah secondary school ataupun dah pergi tertiary you know which they can help
you know so empat plus enam sepuluh sepuluh ni take turn lah take turns to um go to grandma house to this err monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then err this day to this day okay mak pula yang kena tinggal sana
ah macam take care out dia orang ada ni eh ada helpers twenty four seven dekat dalam rumah tapi err macam make sure stay duduk makan tengokkan dia the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be lah
rather than err kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis I rasa macam gitu lagi better lah emak yang in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
monday and thursday my turn okay dia ni wednesday and friday dia ni so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
other elderly parents so um I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in mak nenek into one station the rest all have to rotate lor whether dementia ke tak dementia ke pun rotate
oh maybe macam cik rosnah lah cik rosnah punya mak lah dia kan macam tu satu place when maid with with the helper than everybody come cik rosnah come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then err also so cute then they have this like macam caregiver punya holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then anak-anak lain have to sit take care
um so macam gitu lah macam pada mak lah better mak that way lor I don't know
lah you got a point there also lah it's what you say tapi kalau sebelum dia orang could are given a task kita kena educate lah the main thing here the the the role model is very important
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them macam kita tak boleh
um macam alamak this week I cannot lah I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go eh I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to um macam kita kena tunjuk positif that kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment oh I can't
ya true sebab masa tu nenek okay
but sekarang ni
tak boleh lah sekarang nenek have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is kuat takpe that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul because dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan
you know kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one nak cuba cuba calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
siapa yang tak marah even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
party must come out kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun ah ikat orang tua um macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid itu yang buat
um banyak terjadi didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this lah because nenek is actually educating me you know
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna macam sakit ke macam um
bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak lah banyak lah kalau lah sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan um
punya punya apa mental mental punya
our readiness oh mesti nak kuat
ya really last time I people always says ah tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I geram sangat ke then what is syurga
macam tu I can't even reach syurga if I do this to my mum
I take care of her not because I want syurga I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to macam
I she's get she got annoyed her you know ataupun you know I tak boleh tahan dengan dia then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
ah ya that's why I said because I cakap I dapat awareness ah so it's something that macam god is given me awareness oh okay this is what you need to do lah that I need I can plan compared
ah twenty four seven take care of punya
orang tua and then they they they now I have ah ah macam my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard atau by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to macam mana nak cakap eh a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not ah tu lah kadang bila mak fikir
err macam knowledge macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give um macam
a talk atau macam kasih volunteer atau told people or need help atau need advice I think I have
ya lah you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing ah technician go machine you know macam mana machine
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion dia orang emotional dia orang is so complex that we
don't know ah macam mana professional you are a good ah
it you'd secretaries apa ke all of them based on experience or dia orang punya client punya patients punya experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because dia tak dapat
dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay kita kasih penat tapi tetap keep on scream bukan itu dia tak suka ah dia scream sebab sakit perut you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being dia macam twins lah twins muka sama everything sama tapi tetap perangai lain
her likes and dislikes you know the err for the professional we bring it to the they I just uh based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event dia orang punya
err other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional pun mesti ada family members pun mesti ada and then um very important lah
oh so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the macam
ah apa they call it err
makan ya
ah nevermind just like grandma lah tak tahu macam mana nak bilang actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say nak keluar tak boleh tidur
you know she said ah mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa and then when we stopped her from going out the she said mak nak kencing
there's a oh sebenarnya nak kencing eh ah then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after kencing you tidur okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
err so sometimes kat dalam bilik pun sama and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place atau bilik is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
oh bilik dia sejuk lah kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar she keep on saying nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar then we keep asking why nak keluar then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us ah only if she could tell mak nak keluar because ah bilik ni gelap lah bilik ni sejuk ah okay kita tidur kat luar that will be much
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers dia dah penuh um
susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada some ah
crack ataupun ulcer ataupun sakit perut I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process ah cuma baby it get get baby kita kita jaga macam dia punya journey is to be independent ah kalau old folks kita jaga needed is to be dependent
ah volunteer next week lah dia start tak tahu lah apa dia buat but ah like I told you lah we we started with the orientation online because sekarang we are still in the phase
copyright copyrighting untuk uh tak tahu apa lah dia punya social media punya page lah
tak pergi mana-mana lah this is online because right now we are still in phase two um so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society punya volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines sekarang uh because people you know cannot meet
tak tahu ah all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online sedih engkau kau tengok
can do lah macam so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for macam design uh photography
uh they have macam a knitting crochet with the patients but sekarang takde lah pasal you know it's it's uh only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things ah cancer society they've been around for a long time jadi so they they're very established in the community
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously susah
um but they tried uh I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is uh the apa tu nama dia awareness uh campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these macam cakap cakap pasal
uh ramai orang macam takut nak buat cancer screening because of course takut lah macam people takut nak buat cancer screening
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot lah ya so macam gitu lah ya I'm looking
forward to it lah honestly something I've been wanting to do for a macam dah lama gitu so uh ya inshaallah I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
no next week they will give me the um they have something in mind I think uh ya and then macam I'll just
tengok lah kalau kalau boleh tolong then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
uh but of course they ask that eh no kalau once you commit you have to do it ah bukan macam suka-suka macam this week buat next week tak nak buat ya
you know next year when they start doing uh the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year bila
okay so what they do is on the form in uh apa apa tu during the four main religious group punya holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
hari raya dengan like deepavali
I think now dia tak buat apa-apa lah this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have uh all volunteers come together and kita macam pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have ang pao
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is macam tak boleh afford treatment and then balik rumah rumah macam gitu and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them um like grants and and you know money like contributions uh so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year orang datang like people have to come to them to collect the ang pao um but this may be depending on uh whether or not phase three starts next year lah um I don't know whether that's going to happen ke tak ya so that's next year
kalau tidak boring aje kan buat remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
ya why not kenapa tak boleh
oh ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the uh programs where volunteers kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah tau
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean macam banyak macam program program lah you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya um ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then balik they are both
too penat uh the but um macam especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
kemaskan rumah they showed like one house macam eh kesian lah I tengokkan like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just makanan bawa pergi rumah dia
and stuff like that lah so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have macam apa tu volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
a'ah macam gitu
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract untuk apa kan and it's really up to you
but buat apa ni
but but wait the dogs dari mana
the dogs kat mana
the one dekat
tengah oh ah dekat ya that's true
ini because of the uh apa ni benda ni ah
even with the ini the dogs and the cats
like dog walker pun tak boleh
ambassador ni untuk apa
untuk for like companies lah
ambil gambar apa oh okay
so the fosterers untuk anjing-anjing kucing-kucing like is it is it only untuk the dogs or untuk kucing-kucing also
so when you say volunteer with doing this maknanya you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you bayar untuk semua bende ni semua
so who pays for punya clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
wow that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up macam sekarang dah macam
ada lah duit sikit gitu lah
G O V ni apa
what is the nama oh okay
iya lah charity lah I mean they don't expect the government nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit government gets the money dari kita taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the orang-orang
apa masalah if you if the government don't have enough money to macam apa tu cakap
to give macam to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of kasih anjing-anjing
apa punya development
mana kita ada jungle what we don't have any jungle
but do you all know you know as volunteers of uh and working in this working in this uh apa tu dia sector does the government actually have a plan uh when when macam like they go now kat belakang ni like there's this
tengah tengah this new development kat tengah kat belakang sini
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a macam apa tu cakap
bukan contingency lah tapi macam plan lah like a plan when they develop these new lands
but they've been developing singapore for how long takkan lah macam sampai sekarang tak tahu
mm pasir ris pun ada babi
but how can it be macam gini like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if macam kita baru start nak develop lands or takeover lands it's been macam we've been we've been building
and and other housing since bila kita punya independence nineteen sixties ah
so that's only the dogs because I know dekat pasir ris when I went uh pasir park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
ya because recently kan ada perempuan tu yang kena attack tu
eh kau punya kerusi ni gatal seh
gatal lor
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay jangan duduk situ
kesian spoke but so what what happens so who
uh tapi it's been there for awhile dengan macam
terus kasih lah I always said that
tapi so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the apa anjing-anjing kan I can see
and the uh siapa nama tu
who takes care who is supposed to because kat sini I've seen satu just one snake and
apa ACRES
he's a syrian refugee dia tinggal dekat lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways ah cakap macam gitu
so no honestly uh apa cakap ular-ular
it's not as easy as oh nampak anjing oh uh nampak babi we can see it we can you know some kind of action the ular ni you know macam kat bawah-bawah and then in the longkang-longkang you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but eh takut
uh snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about uh ular macam ular coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen satu kat sini
and and then dia macam masuk dalam longkang and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to macam takut uh because I can't I betul betul there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh so
so the thing is dekat here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the um the stray dogs there is a family of three kadang-kadang macam during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
one auntie dia um auntie tinggal kat tak tahu block mana she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that uh dulu dia kena saman because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about macam people feeding uh stray cats or stray dogs but auntie ni sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food untuk she feeds a lot of stray cats macam she brings macam besar you know macam orang-orang macam ini um
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting um for dia dia cakap dia kena
kena saman so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
tak tahu lah auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie sekarang pun nak kena she has to be careful because she also puts out uh
air untuk kucing-kucing ni so the problem is our area kat sini is a high dengue area
what do you mean two hours to clear siapa yang pergi check
siapa yang nak catch
what do you mean walk past lepas tu kena fine tak boleh feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours ni
how do they know macam who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
um tapi kau duduk situ so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
mesti clear lah
tapi dia the feeder mesti clear makanan tu
ah because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and a'ah betul ya that's true
lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia how much is the saman
takde lah mana ada kat sini signs
ya but the the cats kat sini bagus juga lah and honestly the cats around here gemuk-gemuk because of macam auntie macam gini and this
eh apa kat belakang ni there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same kat sini so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute nama dia sausage aku kasih nama jer lah so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
sampai uh auntie kat bawah ni you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window um I can see someone else coming there's another man kat dia tinggal kat I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage ni honestly I've never seen stray cats
I mean uh macam the the
size tu macam comparable to a domestic cat like a cat punya kat kat rumah orang ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of kat sini I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
have run away dulu we used to see more of the dogs
uh during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because takde orang keluar kan
so I saw them dia selalu tidur under the this lorry because orang pun tak kerja so they were like always sleeping the three of them
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the kucing but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one betul I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore uh anjing tak dah takde lagi
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had kat depan ni right in front here there's these two big palm trees kan so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood macam this um once or twice we've seen them along the macam apa tu the park connector here at bukit batok going up to clementi but they came here the whole there were like there first of all dia hantar satu agaknya macam scout came scout nampak pokok ni scout stayed there so I took gambar lah dengan camera tu and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the apa ni I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was dekat apa jalan dekat park connector tu I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big longkang
they are so you see kat sana ada the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is keluar pergi
jalan you know everybody suddenly everybody pergi uh exercise so in that apa tu nama dia longkang the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the animals crossing the path tak ada lagi during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
uh but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop um and they would do their swimming swimming but tu macam exhibitionist tau the otters are huge exhibitionists
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the longkang where did they go to the uh the botanic garden
so they came out macam every night
tak tahu lah
but they're not the ones yang kat dalam longkang ni they're not that big dekat sini kat park connector the one that goes up to pandan
jangan bedek lah kau cakap different family different types lah
what do you mean mana ada clan
macam apa clan
eh kau jangan tipu lah macam mana boleh gini
eh kau macam eh kau jangan bedek lah I mean sorry this is not
like on the ground macam they go and macam nak nak pergi cari
ah okay like like the people who go sungei buloh cari burung cari burung ah okay okay okay
but they all look the same apa macam mana nak ada divide
so the one yang that I say kat sini
during the circuit breaker kan so I read about the one yang
so do they macam pindah from one place to another or when you say dia orang macam this otter clan kallang clan do they just live there atau macam
they come kat sini to look for the
bukit batok clan what what I honestly don't understand macam mana ni
lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana of course you have to look for orang lain kan
lepas tu sekarang macam mana where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so macam do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and dia orang macam what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
macam during the circuit breaker macam okay so that one whole family keluar pergi serangoon road nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa eh when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just macam duduk kat situ aje
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes kat sini in the drain
how did the otters from macam botanic gardens pergi
kat sini like bukit batok because there is a whole we we see a lot in bukit batok at the park connector in the longkang
like do they get tagged by apanya nama dia ACRES
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about macam on social media pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk all the otters knew there was once kat clementi uh near sixth avenue that big longkang
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the apa longkang besar
um but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it macam a new development that they came from somewhere
eh kau jangan bawa telephone kau masuk toilet boleh nanti orang dengar
kau can you please not macam gini this lucah can you please close the door
so ya that's what I'm saying because dulu I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya lah wildlife ya lah of course aware but takkan lah what I'm saying is takkan lah dulu honestly I mean I grew up in kampung we did not hear about all these otters during kampung dulu kampung banyak benda of course we had the monyet we actually had the monyet uh then
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in kampung but we had the big longkang-longkang
so takkan lah I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the macam the public's consciousness
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged macam apa tu namanya microchipped
do they no I mean when you say they care for them bukan macam it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at macam you can't walk the otter
in singapore do they have them macam untuk ular-ular
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore kan I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at macam just hiding away and going into the longkang
but how do you macam if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the longkang then it just disappears
oh I I remember dulu dekat the the kat mana tu I don't know what lah it was in the news was it a python
so what happens when ACRES comes when apa the the snake now it has the
kucing the kucing is in the perut
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else kan tak kan macam redhill kat bawah block tak kan you you can't just leave it there
kenapa you nak pergi sana
kenapa you think that it's a macam
macam fishy fishy stuff you know
it's cold and you uh tak tahan sejuk you know tak tahan sejuk
so you are you are telling me that kita kena shop before kita pergi korea
I the the thing is that I want to go there sebab I've been there
it's a place whereby I rasa macam
tempat ini bagus untuk bawa partner ah you know
I don't know kalau if there
they have mukshidonna there tapi
I'm not sure if you can apa
sebab kalau you nak shopping dekat sana
bawa benda bring light pack light lah you know
confirm berat
I wanna go there when it's winter tapi
I'm just afraid that kalau
you know lah kita tak tahan sejuk
I tak tahan but you know
I tak I I tak pernah experience snow you know so
mana balik singapore demam if kalau dekat sana dah sejuk obviously you
tak shiok
tak shiok lah siapa nak nak nak fall sick in on holiday seh
but I think you'll like it there lah sebab apa eh
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you pakai lah brand brand itu semua sebab
macam etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream dengan face masks very cheap there
but banyak banyak
dekat sana lebih murah lah compared to you sini ah
we concentrate on korea dulu ah apa cakap australia
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like macam
a road trip tau you know like macam you know melbourne eh like from sydney we drive down to other places
macam we get to see the apa itu
scenery twelve apostle's yang dia orang tengok itu semua
another five years I rasa sebab nak kira-kira plan dua tahun
I dengar husband dia tengah ambil
provided provided if dia masih single lah kalau dia nak kahwin might
by then dah ada anak [kan]
like for me korea I've been there so I bring you to the places that I've been there or maybe to new places that kita yang dapat tahu
I want to try actually but then I don't think it's right lah macam tak
tak boleh ah it's not halal what it's live you cannot eat that
is expensive tapi kalau if you are there you tak buat
kira macam wasted lah you dah dekat sana you dah dah all the way sampai korea abeh you tak
not just crab ah can buy lobster or ketam what
it's it's best to just splurge ah sebab dah dekat sana apa
how to play ini huh
but then I think korea tak ada korean theme park tak ada haunted house lah
I try to find macam
kalau saturday macam pergi sentosa
I will bring you somewhere ah dekat sentosa
no lah not beach lah pakai just wear casual pakai casual jer
resort world tutup kan
check apa ini
nak kena fikir plan B juga seh
last I pergi
two thousand fourteen seh yang
sakit lah
lepas pergi sea aquarium jalan dekat vivo
then beli-beli barang yang tak perlu
I don't realise ini melissa what
is it comfy tak
but I don't like the pattern dia macam pattern wak wak pergi masjid punya kind of slipper
I I saw some of my friends pakai gini ah tapi dia macam wak wak pakai so I don't like
I support no I support the idea of you nak jual
itu mask daripada you nak beli and shortlist semua benda
kalau you buy the mask I will pay for you
tak akan you
makan is because makanan dia they are selling at thirty dollars
no that's why I say you must group the order let's say macam three for eleven dollars
mahal tau you tahu kenapa tak
kalau you tengok
you tengok services of uh delivery services eh like
so berapa
but I think for the start you just buy fifty dulu ah
macam very
macam loud loud colours macam orang might think twice ah nak beli unless it's an occasion ah macam
I nikah pakai itu apa
table dah empat
your mum dah masak
okay jangan berbual dekat sini
but ya lah I have that urge to makan mamak but then again
but adam road mana got
adam road like macam boring ah
yes ada spring leaf
but depends what what time we are going there sebab
eh that time dekat rumah orang
landed property that time we go itu apa spring leaf is it
you bring me there malam-malam lah landed property
there's this kedai apa thohirah eh
you remember tak
yang macam kedai mamak atas ah
dey you lupa eh
dekat landed property
bukan beauty world eh not the beauty world one
tak tahu ah dekat around surrounding landed property ah
dia ada satu kedai mamak terselit but it's the macam spring leaf type ah I think it's spring leaf eh is it
I tak tahu you bawa kereta you bring me I tahu
but I I ingat mahal tempat dia tempat dia mahal
level mahal eh kedai mamak mahal [eh]
landed property I tak tahu dekat mana you bring me there

aside from jalan kayu yang ada kedai mamak

I don't want I never give him before tau dia cakap this is for his fur lah you know
dia bagi then I cakap dengan dia tak apa aku kau kau kirakan nanti aku aku bayar
some amount for the vitamin ini semua ah
because I told him I told him that I kasih dia yang
yang treats itu jer dia cakap oh treats itu untuk
nak train dia orang bukan untuk
treats itu is like to make them obey you
ah macam kucing kan suka benda itu [kan] then they will like come to you
dia jangan forget about me sudah eh that's my worst fear seh
then gini dia tampar
of course ah dia rasa
there's one video that shows that uh satu okay there's two video ah after dengan before ah there's this two cat before video
ada dua kucing then
so yang cat itu the other cat is he keeps looking for dia punya partner
macam you can see that body language dia he's like macam he feels sad ah
dia macam roaming around the house looking for the person
sebab that rumah dah used to have people
in the house what ada bunyi
lampu dia tak dapat retrieve surat
lampu dia tak dapat retrieve surat
owner should have apa
fall off sebab because of he's stressed yeah
then some more dia we never sterilize him what

actually bapa I kasih dia extra tau
nine hundred tak termasuk
uh doesn't include uh comel's punya makan ini semua nine hundred is for him only
makanan dia tak mahal makanan dia like maybe fifty sixty
a'ah that's why I say I can afford to jaga kucing dekat but not in singapore singapore you know one big pack right it costs like sixty seventy dollars you know
come on lah let's say okay let's say dia beli pack besar itu
malaysia baru letak
uh dua puluh lima ringgit paling murah
kalau you nak
you can choose lah the lower end atau the mid the mid range atau yang mahal punya brand
vitamin dia I think dalam tiga puluh lebih ada lah
not treats ah it's more like macam food lah food based ah
I tak tahu how he feed him lah
dia memang dia tahu I suruh beri dia ayam
kan I tanya dia kau ada ayam sebab kucing aku tak makan ikan
oh sebab I think
my mum kasih dia ayam goreng

I makan ikan kita makan dekat bawah ikan dia tak dia tak datang
he only knows his food lah dia tak akan kacau orang lain
tapi hari itu durian dia nak I punya
I ingat I bawa balik durian

oh kucing dia tame ah
so it's like macam
but that that rumah rental is like this fabric this fabric it's like fabric
sarung ya
kalau gelak-gelak continue ini lah
okay akak lah share dulu
sixty percent banyak juga itu sixty percent
mm mm ini sebab semua orang dekat rumah kan
rasanya eh bukan
sudahnya sudah tak ingat tapi kalau biasa kalau sebut goal untuk setiap tahun kan
tak lah masih hiburan macam tahun-tahun lepas tak berjaya
maintain a'ah tapi
ya lah sebab kan ada masalah spine so
macam mana pun kena turunkan berat badan tapi itu lah masalah sampai sekarang tak boleh turun-turun
a'ah so itu tak tercapai lah kan
kalau segi err financial tercapai lah
sebab target dua puluh dua puluh nak simpan err lima belas K
lepas itu dari segi kerja kan nak kerja
maksudnya yang kerja yang kerja baru lah kan environment semua
dapat lah sebab sekarang sudah kerja dengan
walaupun untuk masa sekarang contract kan tapi at least sudah bertukar lah
something new lah okay dari segi
err ibadat pun rasa macam teruk banding dengan dulu kan dulu kan waktu student kan dia macam
affect result lah macam tak tapi sekarang macam makin teruk kan padahal makin tua makin ingat tuhan kan tapi
mm ya lah banyak doa doa nak rebut jodoh jer asyik jodoh jer kan tapi
ya lah benda itu tak seiring dengan yang sepatutnya ah itu
macam nak kahwin lah nak kahwin
tapi tak tak ada rezeki untuk kahwin so kita bawa kepada tahun ini lah dua puluh dua puluh satu lagi apa ah
um dari segi apa lagi ah dari segi
hubungan dengan keluarga tu makin rapat sikit lah sebab
err since kan memang ada dekat rumah
so memang kita orang kita orang satu family semua dekat-dekat
maksudnya kita orang banyak masa bersama macam itu lah
sebab sebelum ini memang ida daripada metrik memang jauh daripada family ida saja yang jauh
a'ah so sekarang macam oh banyak lah masa dengan dia orang so macam lebih memahami lah lebih lebih menerima
itu bukan dia pasal dua puluh dua puluh satu eh
decision yang membawa kepada itu
mm tak cukup sepuluh ini
oh macam ida cakap tadi ah dari segi financial ah itu memang kita sudah nampak kan memang
hundred percent achieve kan lepas tu yang kedua oh satu lagi ida
dengan business ah
err a'ah dengan business err lagi satu
err dua puluh dua puluh
err apa ini tahun yang sangat menguntungkan lah ida bagi ida dalam bidang Shaklee sebab
monthly ida dapat maintain income empat angka
ah macam seribu minimum seribu tiga ah
macam itu sebab kita kat rumah kan eh so kita banyak masa dengan phone so kita nak focus ah dengan business online
so apa lagi ah achieved a'ah lepas itu
mm dapat kerja macam cakap saya tadi apa lagi ah
mm okay dapat publish dua paper
okay empat
a'ah empat lepas itu um
lagi ah
apa lagi ah ya allah teruk ah
okay oh saya
oh sebab ida pun terkejut macam wah banyaknya
ida sudah ida ida berjaya call ida ida berjaya membantu orang dari segi emosi lah kan
seramai seribu lebih kurang ah seribu empat ratus orang
ah ah ya sepanjang orang yang berada di di pusat kuarantin kan
a'ah lagi apa lagi ah
oh sebab tahun dua puluh dua puluh kan sekarang kita sudah ada
seorang yang ida bantu untuk dia
a'ah so ida macam bagi dia ida berjaya lah bagi dia semangat untuk siapkan
dia at least dia sudah nampak
at least dia sudah ada chapter one till five
walaupun belum nak pass
okay so sudah cukup kan tak cukup lagi eh
okay lagi satu kan um ida sudah ya lah kita anak kan kita rasa macam
kita nak bantu parents kan kita nak bagi duit setiap bulan
okay err sebelum ini dua puluh dua puluh itu ida dah ida maintain
err ida berjaya maintain setiap bulan tanpa miss
ida bagi dekat dia orang uh tiga angka seorang ah macam tu
so ida macam okay so hopefully dua puluh dua dua puluh satu ini
ida berjaya maintain lah bagi mungkin boleh increase
um macam itu ah sebab sebelum ini kan tak ada duit
pendapatan oh okay okay bagus
tak ada lah kot can
oh dia tak yakin ah
because apa
macam rude dia itu bagus ke
project tak dapat jalan
terlalu painful tak percaya ya
saya um dengan bahasa yang sopannya saya putus cinta
then yang lagi yang lagi painful adalah
err kan so so memang saya tak dapat nak buat apa-apa tak akan lah saya nak
suruh dia putuskan hubungan kan so saya terpaksa terima lah
the most lah kan lepas itu second
second err waktu first
eh itu first COVID ini datang saya rasa macam oh sangat struggle
sebab sebelum ini you tak pernah duduk rumah tanpa buat apa-apa
so then tak pernah duduk rumah selama itu
kan biasa berjauhan dua-dua buat kerja so saya rasa benda itu sangat
sangat menyakitkan lah untuk untuk that okay
yang okay saya dalam hidup kan
so adalah yang rapat kan dua tiga orang
then yang paling menyakitkan tahun ini adalah
a'ah tahun okay dua puluh dua puluh kan
yang dua puluh dua puluh ya like bila kita sudah tak ada kawan kita ada kawan rapat saja at
of course lah kita punya expectation itu
tinggi kan sebab ya lah kita tak ada siapa-siapa so
err untuk tahun dua puluh dua puluh oh saya baru tahu dia kawan
so dia kawan adalah untuk untuk err kawan untuk waktu susah
ah waktu dia susah ha waktu dia susah lepas tu
err saya pantang kalau orang menipu ha saya memang pantang
so ada satu hari itu dia cakap dia sudah balik semenanjung
tapi waktu itu kebetulan saya ada dekat airport
so memang terang-terang dia dia itu ada dekat airport okay dia bagi tahu dia sudah balik dua hari lepas
okay kebetulan dua hari kemudian itu saya pergi airport
so saya nampak dia dekat airport so maksudnya dua hari sebelum itu dia belum balik
dia masih ada dekat sini tapi dia cakap dia sudah balik huh
so memang terang-terang itu kak itu dia okay
so saya rasa kepercayaan saya tertipu lah kenapa dia kenapa dia nak menipu
bagi tahu saja lah a'ah
so saya rasa kalau benda itu
benda itu dia balik eh eh salah
tak payah sebut tempat eh
ya lah benda yang besar macam itu dia boleh tipu uh ya lah dia nak balik daripada
daripada sini naik flight kan dia boleh tipu lagi lah benda lain
kan yang kecil-kecil saya rasa macam
susah lah untuk terima okay lain tak ada kot okay tiga saja
yang saya rasa betul adalah saya buat keputusan untuk saya stay di sini
untuk masih ah berada di sini jauh daripada keluarga walaupun saya cakap tadi
saya punya relationship dengan keluarga sudah makin bagus kan tapi saya masih tetap
familiar untuk di sini berada jauh daripada keluarga jauh daripada
itu lah
kita pun struggle
uh apa soalan itu tadi about decision kan
first ya lah bila saya pilih kat sini then err waktu hari itu saya dapat kerja saya dapat tawaran juga dekat terengganu tahu
a'ah sebenarnya
yang pilihkan itu salah apa lagi ah
okay lagi apa ah
tak ada sudah kot
kan tak ada sudah kot
apa ah
sama saja lah
ya lah someone special pun tak ada lagi
mungkin tinggal house mate lah house mate
dua jenis saja lah
siapa ah
mungkin saya punya mentor dalam business lah kot
okay the business Shaklee kan saya punya mentor
a'ah itu dari segi financial lah sebab dia
err dia manage untuk dapat income err
six figures setiap bulan
a'ah which is seratus ribu lebih ah setiap bulan so dia memang million earner lah
itu dari segi financial lah
okay dari segi
oh kalau macam dari segi ibadah kan benda yang baik macam
neelofah lah kot sebab saya sekarang baru saya follow dia dia punya telegram
a'ah so dia banyak share kan dia banyak ya lah dia dia
dia macam dulu ya lah yang kita yang kita nampak artist kan social tapi
dia punya ilmu macam makin lama makin ah improve dia punya sharing
pasal hadis lah pasal benda yang baik-baik itu rasa macam ya allah bagusnya macam itu
so satu lagi oh seorang lagi ini lah saya punya sahabat lah lelaki
err yang saya panggil dia bapa so sometimes dia macam
err sangat memberi inspirasi lah untuk settle scandal itu macam bersemangat
err oh expect sebab dia counsellor kan maksudnya dia dia punya mentor saya juga lah
so kadang okay dia banyak bagi saya support lah inspirasi
yang tak tahu masa eh ini
a'ah tak semestinya positive kan
untuk dua puluh dua puluh ini ramai lah
sebab dia macam ada dua fasa tau
yang satu keluarga lah sepanjang kan berapa enam bulan kan
so dengan family so dengan dengan parents lah dengan parents
dengan anak buah dengan parents dengan mak ayah anak buah dengan kakak
dengan house mate lah ah itu lah
oh okay ya apa-apa nak duduk call
oh dia orang memang influence ah
kalau kalau macam family tak ada lah influence sangat kan
itu macam biasa saja lah okay kadang ya lah kadang kita yang sendiri minta
dia orang suggest apa-apa kan so tak ada lah cerita-cerita mengarut sangat kan
so cuma kita consider lah kan
tapi yang paling adalah bapa lah itu dari dari segi semua lah
pasal saya punya kerjaya saya punya financial
lepas tu ah pasal kehidupan lah
ya so mostly yang semua nasihat semua ida ikut eh ida ikut saya ikut
okay sebab saya ini bukan yang jenis orang yang baca buku
menyalahkan a'ah
ada satu buku ah buku ada satu buku ini ida pernah baca tajuk dia walking tau
ya lah ida tak ingat sangat isi dia tapi ida ingat ah buku itu
buku warna hijau kan dia nipis saja buku itu buku itu banyak cerita pasal ini lah
pasal kegagalan lah so macam mana dia bangun untuk terus berjalan
aku kena cari balik yang ada tak so apa lagi ah
okay ada satu buku ini buku cinta tahu
bukan dia macam buku romantic lah ida cakap tajuk dia I love you
buku itu tebal sangat ah buku orang putih juga
um I tajuk dia I love you so buku ini
um oh dia dia macam flashback balik uh uh penulis dia perempuan lah
dia flashback balik apa yang berlaku sepanjang dia bersama dengan kekasih dia
a'ah so err saat kekasih dia sudah mati kan
lepas itu dia tapi perit dia dia dia sudah tua lah so dia memang sudah spend
err so dia dia flashback balik daripada zaman dulu macam mana dia kenal macam itu lah
so kadang dia dia macam
okay before before lelaki itu meninggal lelaki itu sakit tau so before itu dia sudah
okay dia isteri dia dia memang err sangat dependent pada suami uh kekasih dia
ah so bila ya lah orang putih biasa lah kan tak kahwin so
dia sebelum oh dia sakit dia sakit lepas itu dia makin critical so
dia macam nak ajar uh perempuan itu untuk berdikari
so err sepanjang sebulan lebih dia banyak menulis
so macam okay dia dia akan tulis dan dia akan simpan note note
dia dia tak tulis dalam buku tapi dia buat note macam sticky notes dia tampal dekat situ macam dekat
ah mana-mana lah dia suruh do eh dia tinggal notes ah
lepas itu lah bila suami dia meninggal so dia nak buat eh
bila kekasih dia meninggal so bila dia nak buat itu dia akan jumpa notes itu

then bila I salam ya I salam nenek abeh I cium dia but obviously nenek is a bit uncomfortable with it then she like elak-elak
you know when you salam her also she's like that what ya
ya she will just immediately retract it back which is damn weird so I macam mm okay lah whatever then I told nenek
oops tersalah nak cium mama alah cium jer lah nenek sekali

ya because I was busy at home if I'm at mama's house I'm usually like talking to nenek and mama
I cannot believe we have to gossip for a good end ah one hour but it's okay these are all juicy details so at least people will actually be entertained when they dengar and dia macam wah actually this couple quite interesting we have to vet this we have dude come on this is not a chore

no the news is like juicy gossip news so one of it was about first news was about the err adik ipar pakai motor dia motor dia hilang
so rupanya dia ingatkan adik ipar dia curi which is true lah dia curi lah as in without the permission lepas tu accident
ya but anyway adik ipar dia meninggal bro
oh about the banjir oh then pramugara buka kedai it was quite fun ah actually when we were watching it
kan macam so juicy
besok thursday eh
you rasa apa jadi
pasal there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
lily give birth with seluar
then I thought ushu will kahwin the
ya so complicated and technically he already lafaz cerai
when he said that no he put a syarat he said that if you go and see your father
I will ceraikan you remember
he pull back the cerai is it that's what
because talak will jatuh as long as your syarat is tunai technically dia punya syarat dah tertunai tau pasal dia cakap macam gitu he said kalau what did he say ah something like kalau
you jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau
apa aku cerai apa aku eh macam mana eh
no lah cuma I tahu kalau macam benda gini you kena consult ustaz because ni fasakh
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the talak dah jatuh then you have to just reconcile lah and say aku nikah dengan you know you have to lafaz it back eh no need to lafaz it back but you have to do it with a saksi something like that ah meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why yang that time ija ibu dengan ayah he lafaz it right then they already back together what because mubin kept on pestering them back as long as the talak dah jatuh they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered cerai and they have to immediately consult
ustaz or as in like ah
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to angkat nikah back again
arwah mak long and pak long is cerai cerai dude
kan he already cerai her kan twenty sixteen kan kita kahwin kan ada satu gambar mak long tak ada
ingat tak then mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita and then suddenly pak long say ah okay okay kita then he asked mak long to walk away then I was just there like wah that's mean
kawan I satu mengandung then she complained kat twitter dia cakap yang every time kalau part dia share good news dengan family dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian eh
meaning like like kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak so dia selalu ada anak apa so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
uh doa-doa kakak kau ah yang mengandung you know
no uh ya tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah
tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek then nenek is like saying you know
obviously he's gonna nenek still staying with mama
ya lah he's gonna buy it from pak busu
pak busu bought it at hundred thousandish cheap ah so unfair ah
I pun tak tahu why ya
dia nak hantar anak dia yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year kan anak dia so two years ya so
tu yang tadi one of the parents say
alah dia sihat for the next few years jer dah happy
apa you nak cakap tadi
kan I dah lupa
ni ah nanti lepas ni I treat you to
dalgona kalau tak tidur
I layan ah
no I layan you ah tak tidur
a'ah seh I want to watch more than family seh dah dua hari
dude you lagi into the drama than I am seh cantik eh dia tapi macam flawless
kamal adli macam very like
that's true ah and then meletop I think that was what they talking about like they wanted
ya lah dua ribu dua puluh we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
kan tu lah masalahnya
semua resolution pun dah tak tercapai semuanya
err of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye lah cakap pasal redo back everything sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight lah memang nak nak turunkan berat badan lah harap harapnya macam tu tahun target eh
this year target nya lebih kurang dalam maybe fifteen ya
serious ah sihat ke kalau macam tu
oh I cannot do the skipping sebab dengan spine issue lah so macam kalau skipping nanti patah pula tulang belakang so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
tu lah
ya achievable so I would say that kalau fifteen maksudnya dalam sebulan kena target at least two lah
tapi tapi sebenarnya one half pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu lah lebih kurang
ya so that's another thing lah pasal vegetarian kan macam ya before this sebab baru adapt to vegetarian so banyak makan processed food lah
actually adapt tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat macam tu kan sebenarnya tak boleh so I was thinking of this year kalau boleh nak jadi vegetarian and grow my own food like tanam sayur ataupun tanam
tanam sayur lah basically kita orang dah tanam benda lain kan macam tu lah anyway
ya how about you how about you what is what is your resolution untuk tahun ni
for business apa lah apa apa the idea business yang dah ada buat masa ni
I see surprise delivery menarik
I see so the surprise part lah yang betul-betul make meaningful
I see so macam mana sebelum delivery ni dia akan ada macam set set dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh customise ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu
okay faham
so basically ni macam err macam bukan professional dia macam lebih kurang special customisation lah
okay tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam uh food based ke ataupun
oh okay lah okay maksudnya dah ada customer ah
oh wow ya ya ya ya sebab ya lah sekarang ni orang pun suka eh macam boleh pergi surprise delivery lepas tu boleh hantar eh boleh share dekat Insta kan macam tu lah
I see interesting it's interesting so apa lah nama the surprise delivery service ni apa nama dia
oh wow okay kotak riang so kotak riang basically like macam gift uh box of happiness lah box of happiness
okay okay okay betul betul new year resolution lah
so what do you have for now ada tak benda-benda yang ya it's still give you some happiness in the world tapi healthy lah
I see tapi sugar free how is that achievable even
menarik menarik so err healthy diet healthy food
basically ya lah macam kita pun tengok kan dengan COVID punya issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat kan ah so ya penting lah very very important lah untuk
tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah when you get rich I will be the first person yang you have to belanja lah kan aduhai
oh resolution lain apart from losing weight I would say that okay lah dia macam satu we have to look at the whole system lah kan I started with trying to eat
healthily kan I want to err I want to lose weight so I have to live live err I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just kita nak kurangkan berat badan is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet kan most of the thing yang you beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak tau
especially sayur lah macam tu kan jadi macam I was thinking of and kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam supermarket
kan so we didn't know pun macam kita opt untuk healthily tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya lah mm kita tahu economically macam mana
macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya sekarang ni ramai juga kan orang monetise daripada YouTube kan and then ya betul betul and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
betul betul okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya macam
orang kata tanam jer lah tapi sebenarnya nak tanam pun ada cara kan ya ya ya
ya interesting hmm okay boleh boleh masuk dalam resolutions seterusnya okay
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so cakap pasal healthy and rich kan kalau lah you nak sum up lah the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word lah apa you punya apa one word yang will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
wow oh okay alright alright maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni the the timeline the the stories not good yang you need the plot twist
untuk diri sendiri eh
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person macam it ya maybe with better networking kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh bring it forward kan ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself lah I would say that two thousand twenty dengan COVID dan sebagainya it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
tak jadi apa-apa pun so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the kind to the world lah like environmentally more friendly lah
okay apa lagi takkan tu jer apa lagi share lah resolution
mmhmm what what kind of me time like pergi bowling macam tu
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill yang you dah ada and then you want to enhance ataupun like new skill
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like jadi ya jadi pemain guitar oh my god
ah okay ya masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama I didn't really update
but but somehow piano like ini dua benda yang berbeza tau mostly guitar punya song it's like metal you know very hard one piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it juga makin besar makin matang you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
I see so with before this kak long pernah juga ada idea macam nak enroll class tau and of course I want to also look into yang macam elegant elegant ni lah kan cuma kenapa bukan piano sebab piano requires some set up lah then tak dapat berlatih kat rumah kan macam tu so I was thinking of beli ukulele ke violin something like that lah so macam at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you kan kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak wind punya apa ni punya instruments you need a whole band baru dia akan menjadi or you main trumpet sorang-sorang macam ni lah dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward tu clarinet that's clarinet so it will
ah Squidward kan so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it lah macam tu
interesting okay lah basically kan macam kita boleh tengok kan sometime our education system
focus on more maths science tapi kan art art is very important human very connected to any beautiful things be it the beautiful things tu dalam bentuk visual ataupun audio lah macam music kan because somehow that makes us
err be more empathy kan dan buat kita more human lah and in your own case kan macam memang buat hard science buat maths kan err
at the end you will turn to robot lah if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you macam tu kan okay so piano so that's the skill yang basically dream lah belum belum start ah do you have any skill yang just you want to enhance lah yang you dah ada dah ada base base[lah
ataupun something lah selain daripada skill err musical skill ada skill lain tak
but mandarin is kinda hard though because tak silap mandarin kan dia ada macam empat
empat macam apa eh apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi something you know
ya that's the thing sebab basically ya bila kita boleh connect to to a person dengan dia punya mother tongue it will be lebih ni lah kan
ya ya lagipun kita pun multi racial I think it's best untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga kan betul betul interesting interesting
so okay buat masa sekarang how many language you know like even it's amateur pun tak faham how many I will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea daripada mana because you watch oh my god alright alright
so many language cakap pasal korea I watch a very very good good drama I'm not sure you have watched it or not tapi dia berkaitan dengan business lah since you pun nak buat business kan
ya cerita tu menarik tau because dia menunjukkan macam mana yes
so orang selalu tengok kan orang business ni at at the end of the success tau like the only the tip of the iceberg lah when ya and then macam kita pun jealous lah bila dia lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
even though macam belum kaya lagi but there every single day I woke up
even though I would say that sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself benda yang paling belajar is you need a good mentor
macam bila you bila you dah kaya ramai jer orang yang akan datang kan berpusu-pusu tapi basically kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul care ataupun just nak ride on us macam tu kan
ya that's the thing so cakap pasal tak kaya tapi means a lot sebab
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself adalah untuk selesaikan social issues like
ikut lah issue nya about environmental ke apa kan so because I do believe that in the in the in the keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan
kita perlukan orang buat business untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work lah kita pun tahu politician have so many other things kan tapi I would say that business kita boleh provide like kita boleh provide ya macam cakap lah kerja untuk orang kan kita boleh provide service diorang macam in your case you nak buat surprise delivery kan you boleh make people happy and so I would say that
instead of ya lah I used to work juga dulu kan dengan boss boss bukannya senang kan kita salah pun
kita salah memang confirm salah kita betul pun kita salah kan jadi macam ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age lah untuk
try error jatuh explore ya explore
jangan jangan berhenti terlalu cepat sometimes you didn't know macam awak tengok kan business business yang dah berjaya
that take years then even just take even one to two years lah yang one to two years ni bukannya entrepreneur dia grant-preneur sebab dia dapat duit daripada grant kan macam tu lah
tapi basically kan err orang perlukan at least six seven years untuk dia betul-betul ada strong base kan so if you stop too early
macam let's say kita nak makan durian kan even though we already see the buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita ambik pokok durian kan kita sibuk nak makan durian nak makan durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit kan it's not going to taste good even though you nampak hari-hari tapi you kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri
tapi the the biggest thing ialah perseverance untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening kan tapi
what kenapa apa what what what was
oh so itu adalah interesting part I would say that
he is a good actor tau so basically err sebenarnya kan bagus jer cerita start up ni walaupun dia letak satu lead actor yang teruk gila tapi basically dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang
lead actor pun dah terlalu superficial tau macam terlalu hebat so sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda
so walaupun awak tak tengok character nam do san tu sangat-sangat loser kan tapi basically that's how people at twenties macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu
compare to someone yang dah macam han ji pyeong yang dah thirties tau
so tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang production ni pun tak sangka dia akan backfire macam ni
sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada synopsis kan ada seorang mentor yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat han ji pyeong tapi because he is a good actor himself yang membuatkan
kita move dengan perasaan dia sampai kita sedangkan character tu tanpa tanpa interpretation daripada dia kan mungkin akan jadi character yang sangat annoying
harsh lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi because err the actor himself kan put so many emotions on the face
aiya many conflicts err conflicting emotions yang kita tahu yang he is not bad he is just
err mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati lah tapi when I think back and if I am mad at nam do san I would say that I'm mad at younger me juga
nonton suka hati kita lah kita nak suka siapa kan that is our own right tapi I would say it's a good reflection lah it's a good reflection
three years pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus that's the thing
sebab yang lain ada character development tau the other two friends tapi yang tu macam stay like just like that
ya just just better sikit lah ada coat sendiri tak payah pinjam that's the only improvement made kan kan tu lah aduh
okay ada lagi ke resolution untuk tahun ni anything eh untuk tahun ni
eh small thing seh yang buat benda jadi great and big ya
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya lah macam zaman study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute kadang-kadang boleh push you
like push you lah macam in the very last minute kan you boleh focus and sometimes your creative juice like macam tu kan tapi masalahnya in real life kan when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as err persekitaran lah environment macam tiba-tiba COVID dan sebagainya kan so macam
procrastination akan backfire you compare to someone belajar yang it's just you and your assignment lah macam tu kan
maybe because you are a person yang work under pressure
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you kena you kena combine kerja you dengan team mate lain like just imagine if the team mate buat macam tu to you kan at the last day baru dia nak submit dia punya
drag yourself ya betul betul betul procrastination
and somehow sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa lah procrastination ni pun
sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya social media juga kan macam in my own case lah I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video kan tiba-tiba another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so itu yang menarik then tu lah tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu kan ada tengok satu documentary tau dekat
documentary dekat Netflix ah cerita pasal social network tau macam mana sebenarnya since since kita guna all this services for free kan macam Facebook and all those thing kan basically we are
pelik ah sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah customer kan tapi kita tak bayar so tu maksudnya kita bukan customer maksudnya kita adalah
data err their their modal macam tu kan so
so dia dah baca tau kita punya behaviour dia dah baca kita punya interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so macam dia tahu macam mana nak keep us hook kita tengok one lepas satu-satu kan lagi satu aduh lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar
macam fikir fikir contoh kata oh rasa nak beli katil ah tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us lah kan our microphone is always on kita tak pernah pun default untuk tutup kan somehow
ya tapi maksudnya ya maksudnya kalau lah basically okay kalau diorang dengar diorang just feed us dengan ads okay lah tetap okay juga lah sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli kan but how about if bad people
so tu lah macam bila kita bila kita gunakan service ni for free kan for free
so kita basically menjual diri kita to them lah like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me sebab tu penting kita baca like agreements and all term and condition
macam tu lah like term and condition if you agree tick siapa pun nak baca tick kan kat situ that that's the thing
tapi takpe lah basically the basically the idea is walaupun kita tahu yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku at least kita tahu dia ambil so at least kita boleh jaga-jaga lah more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things kan macam tu
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now macam dulu kan like ten years back kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa that is something like ridiculously happened tau macam
kan kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita uh cik boleh tak saya tengok
err saya nak tengok apa periuk err dapur macam mana ada hood ke tak ada hood uh ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of of other person kan because that person boleh buat live dekat dia punya
bilik kan macam tu
ya ya even oh my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched dia siap tunjuk the secret room
and basically kan senangnya sekarang ni with the technology ada the semua kan dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik your plan house plan tau
hanya dengan gambar sekarang pun technology yang ada with with pictures you take pictures you can even like kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then macam nak masuk pun senang
yes and somehow this wealthy people pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan post so orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya rule dalam kita post social media ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh post pasal vacation after the vacation
yes sebab basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then curi lah apa saja
itu lah dunia sekarang different lah people
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing tau macam orang dulu kan dia communication nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu jer lah masa untuk interact tau so you really have to all out kan tapi people nowadays kan dia neglect
organik punya communication tapi dia boleh share every single thing about dia punya life kan tapi bila orang judge dia marah pula
orang tak like tak tak tak bagi reactions pun dia marah kan so
so okay cakap pasal tu that's there's one more lah one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution lah twenty twenty one oh my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day tau macam
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone tau so I was like macam I want to segment lah macam okay pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically kadang-kadang check tu actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then macam then all the video sometimes is err ridiculous err like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness kan so macam
so I want to segment lah macam okay dalam masa tiga jam ni I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it macam tu lah that's the idea
macam quota ah
oh you can ignore lah dia tak macam parental parental control yang terus off oh okay okay
just just to remind you lah bukan lah macam guru discipline something like that kan
tapi ada apps tau untuk buat benda tu which is very interesting I just download it lah macam nama dia forest tau so macam bila you start the apps kan you kena set lah you nak you nak buat kerja berapa lama
okay so dia ada beza tau tiga puluh minit dia punya shrub jer kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok tau kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah tau
so basically kan dia untuk bantu you untuk err focus so you buka app you set tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja kan so you tak boleh buka apps lain you kena tutup dengan apps tu sahaja
kalau lah tiga puluh minit you access your phone pokok tu akan mati tau tapi kalau kalau you kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan notify you okay pokok tu dah hidup and basically everyday you have a patch of forest untuk dibangunkan
yes very interesting so macam ah so macam basically kan dia bagi kita award macam dia bagi reward lah reward macam
okay so kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian
tak so depress
a'ah maksudnya
betul sebab manusia ni sukakan acknowledgement tapi takkan kita nak suruh ya yes
takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam kan it's just like boss datang okay congratulations four hours kan tak logic ah kan
that's very intriguing seh tu satu benda forest ada satu lagi tau interesting juga nama dia sleepy town so apa yang kita buat adalah err kita set lah satu hari kita nak tidur dalam enam jam kan so bila nak tidur kita buka apps tu dan tutup phone dengan apps tu on on running lah okay
so kalau you bangun dalam masa you dapat tidur tujuh jam ataupun you pasal you tak access phone dah lepas you dah set the alarm kan you akan bina the town
sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping lah so you will enjoy it when you so dia lebih daripada quality life lah so macam
interesting I ya lah saja jer nak tengok apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes I already sleep tau tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok phone sebab nak tengok sekejap jer end up kan
mula-mula jer yes end up Netflix tiba-tiba kan tiba-tiba so basically dia memang dia memang ada design untuk bagi orang hook
and tapi kita kena take back the power lah we have to unhook all that
ya yang peliknya dia bukan macam puppy tau yang macam memang sentiasa entertain anyone dia diva and then macam
make macam sangat-sangat annoying ah macam if if I need you rub me rub me now and when I don't like it I will just leave you macam tu kan
tu lah orang cakap kan macam bila kita bela kucing kita yang jadi servant to the cat
I think because they are cute tapi elegant
they they keep their eh I know tak lah macam cara dia tidur you know then oh tapi tak juga
tapi tapi ya cats can be very then sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam
ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang instead of bela anak kan maybe sebab bela binatang lebih bagus lah kot dari bela anak kan sebab bela anak ni
yeah maybe sometimes diorang investment so
macam tu lah
oh my god zombie apocalypse tapi agaknya okay lah ya zombie apocalypse tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa
I don't know I I have seen the video people cakap the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know lah tapi I would say apocalypse akan berlaku so be it zombie or not but still ah kata lah kalau that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers tau macam menarik ah orang yang boleh buat bunkers kat bawah rumah kan macam tu because you want to save save your family lah at least and sebab
tak payah tak payah zombie lah apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada food ration
and then at least ada survival skill kan let's say lah kalau berlaku
disasters kan actually zombie apocalypse akan leads kepada disaster ah dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah ah kan dan sebagainya kan so um kita kena ada survival skill
let's say kalau macam mana kita nak um menyorok kat mana kan ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab ya lah so far nak cakap pasal zombie ni kita tak tahu zombie tu macam mana
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see kan can only err listen ah macam tu kan so tak tahu cuma I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared lah kan
let's say kalau zombie semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang kan so kita kena
ah duduk dalam air kan betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air at least kita kena basic macam rafting ke apa macam tu kan
ya it's not zombie ah we call it bunk out bag dia macam
err bag tu ada cukup lah untuk something happened ada macam first aid macam ada dry food and then macam err your details pasal you punya your blood semua kan so macam kalau orang jumpa you terbaring ke apa you ni tapi kita panggil bunk out bag lah macam tu ya but kalau kalau kita cakap zombie kit tu orang akan rasa oh it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie kan but actually err disclaimer sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja jer lah it don't have to be zombie let's say lah kalau ada orang masuk rumah you yes war we don't we never know kan macam even though kita rasa everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year yang buatkan apa pun kita punya resolution tak tercapai tu kan so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so mmhmm
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it lah so macam tak tahu lah kalau macam overseas kan orang akan macam ada kan non disclosure kan macam tu tapi macam
I would say that berapa berapa probability dan possibility dia ah then macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya contractor tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana kan so macam boleh berlaku tapi I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous lah sebab maybe ah kan macam for now I would say that if we pun orang akan rasa oh this for safety
but for people yang macam influential kan let's say say it's um
ya kalau dalam movie kalau macam mafia ni kalau orang tu buat bunker untuk dia dia tembak jer lepas tu kan ah of course lah we cannot do that kan
cakap pasal rumah it's very interesting kan how ya people try to customise house kan macam buat secret room macam buat bunker and now people sekarang macam buat apa catio untuk kucing lah eh macam buat hub ya
cat is like social media ah hook you kan macam tu
and make them you know that's the thing err we call it like cat nourishment ah macam cats used to live in the wild tapi kita yang bring in the home kan so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is kejar rama-rama
things like that kan so that is tapi kalau ada rumah the first thing I want to have is swimming pool lah
seriously you want to hi and things waktu swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least bukan semua baka lah maybe some some breed can lah macam I would say bengal ke apa yang yang very wild one kan tapi basically kalau perasan semua kucing berenang most of them adalah yang short hair
ya instead of long hair ah macam tu sebab so kalau long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then tak dapat macam wiggle wiggle badan dia how dogs do it kan
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place untuk macam
buat yoga with all the sun you know because somehow kan kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then kita most of the time stay at home working at home and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D tau but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight kan so I was thinking kalau ada rumah kan in the middle of the house I want to make sure the dia punya dinding tu
um made from glass no no made from glass so dia dia dia
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight macam tu
like buat like igloo style so macam dok macam macam ni lah kubah macam tu
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive lah kan macam during this trying time kan macam ya every new year pun kita buat resolution kan pastu kita buat plans and everything because we want to look forward in life lah
macam and most of dreamers pun orang rasa macam crazy people in the beginning kan macam
macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik wright kan the the the wright brothers kan
macam when they want to fly things siapa jer yang setuju
tapi now that is diorang punya determination tu yang membuat we can cross country kan kita boleh experience things on the other side of the world
betul I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected lah dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat heavily affected
sebab ya lah diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak operate kan
oh tak boleh langsung ya then most people yang kerja dalam industry tu diorang adalah macam skillful people tapi in one area tau so diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain
ya that's interesting like paramedics pun boleh kan macam tu like basic basic ah menarik menarik so ya lah macam
because senang kan bila orang kena lay off ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena lay off sekarang sangat
dan somehow apart from dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan industry revolution industry kan bila everything's automated semua benda pakai robot pasal dia akan take away our jobs kan tiba-tiba kita berlaku economic punya macam ni yang yang merudum kan so
sebab itu lah kita buat business kot kan boleh lah bantu orang maybe provide more jobs to people kan sebab the economy have to run lah
ya because somehow dengan ramai orang kena laid off employer pun ada banyak sangat pilihan so the competition is very very high
macam tu kan
and cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada business kan lah
I would say that kesan besar kepada education system juga lah kan macam kids nowadays I would say sometimes bagus juga sebab orang dah mula adopt online learning sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan interactions
dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam universities kan some universities are err fully err fully on online platform kan
tapi bila kita dekat university kita bukannya hanya belajar theory dan kita punya subject tapi life lesson macam
kita belajar communicate kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi kan so all that adalah very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some sometime boleh juga bagi tapi I don't know how much the impact will be towards the character building
ya betul betul ya
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose kan tapi friends adalah orang yang you boleh choose ya kan so macam
you boleh choose and and boleh align minat dan sebagainya kan compare to ni then ya lah macam same eh macam peer kan macam same age peer sangat sangat penting untuk kita associate untuk kita faham
dan sebagainya so
ya akan jadi ada impact yang besar lah kepada characters building macam tu
ya just imagine before this pun graduates susah nak dapat kerja because
it's a very competitive market kan and now kita ada so many
err talented people kena laid off and compete together with them
ya macam dah lah nak compete each other pun dah hard enough and then kena compete lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun experience it's not going to be easy
tapi new economy pun akan terbuka lah macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi influencer kan sebab ya like influencer pun boleh give money
dah lama kan
cuma bahaya dengan being influencer ni sometimes they are not being human tau macam
and they ya and diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu social status yang sometimes unachievable kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar kan untuk bagi nampak abs nampak kurus sometimes it's just about angle
then people yang see that they didn't know pun itu adalah angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that sedangkan all that is just an illusion is a it is just an different angle kan camera trick that's the thing sometimes
dah lah tu lah jadi lebih mencabar lah kat kita punya youth kalau keadaan macam ni ya lah lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
ya even big brands pun sekarang dah start to work with influencers instead of artists yang memang buat art tau berkarya
okay lah somehow artist people diorang charge memang terlalu mahal kan and influencers dia ada dia ada bigger fan base
ya faham
dan artist dan actress ni dia terpaksa produce something dulu kan baru orang boleh look up to them kan compared to influencer ni
pergi makan pun orang suka kan pergi jogging pun orang suka kan so macam cuma tu lah kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh set unrealistic thing ah
so fuh banyak juga kita borak ni kan daripada start dengan resolution cerita pasal zombie apocalypse dan sebagainya so ya hopefully takpe lah yang penting kita start sekarang buat sekarang macam
ya boleh
untuk family ah untuk family err I would say that more collaborations macam
ya lah before this I would say that I live on my own lah pun duduk macam jauh kan so macam
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal kan tapi I want this family to be more collaborative like masak sama-sama
buat kerja sama-sama and even though macam ya lah adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one kan even though of course lah macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah kan tapi basically ah but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
kadang-kadang macam ya lah kita pun kena bergerak sebagai family
betul how about you apa yang you uh foresee for as a family punya movement
aduhai okay lah
ya ya ya hopefully lah macam and it don't have to be far pun but at least places that we can
okay jom rasanya
boleh lah kan kita start put in the planner ataupun buat vision board kan letak dekat dalam semua lawa-lawa kan and satu benda lagi it's good tau actually bila kita tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us lah
ya because when we say it kan tak ada lah nanti at the end takkan lah nanti at the end of the year nanti macam eh apa jadi dengan macam tu kan so macam
so dia orang like um
dia orang want to dia orang exit already tapi dia orang nak masuk balik so when they want to masuk balik and then like the security guard stop them lah
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but dia orang like um
they insisted coming in lah and then lepas tu they block the way and then this security guard was like um he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched lah lepas tu dia
lepas tu dia punya couple tak happy lah habis tu dia orang um so like the security guard
lepas tu dia cakap oh like I nak pergi beli uh I nak pergi ambil allen key
ah dia nak pergi ambil allen key lah daripada dia punya service counter lepas tu um
after they take the like they want to take the allen key lepas tu dia cakap eh err please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's dia orang punya pasal lah
err when when they left I ask this security guard lah like you know um like tak kisah pasal dia orang lah sebab dia orang um they they were trying to be difficult lah because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so lepas tu another security guard datang lepas tu dia cakap oh err this couple lah they have a problem lah they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark lah why why
why um why do you err err how did he touch in the first place lepas tu
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
lepas tu there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
eh tak boleh cakap nama dia
tak boleh cakap nama store
tapi like you are not supposed to eat there lah because
takut you expose yourself to
ya lah lepas tu dia argued dia cakap oh my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
lepas tu we're like no
jadi dia cakap lor you know like um
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down kat rumah and then like melepak tengok tengok youtube macam my bapa so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
oh like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like pahala I'm like sometimes kan you buat kerja bukan pasal pahala you nak buat kerja pasal you nak care for the person you know
lepas tu you tengah cleaning buntut lagi
you nangis
ya lah tapi you nangis ke tak
macam you kasih birth to anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu kind of thing
wow nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa tau
you tahu kenapa tak pasal I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so kalau you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
tapi like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things macam even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like oh I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop lah or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like memang like I think it's just human nature lah like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
tu memang dah macam amanah lah pasal dia sedekah gaji itu kan
mm alhamdulillah banyak rezeki
you macam apa tu um in debts lah
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like kalau is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like um
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
tapi at the same time meh pasal dia punya selfish thoughts macam begitu he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like bila dia dah meninggal like you have to live your life and his ah if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to jaga dia bila masa you nak you nak belajar
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
correct because I mean I understand lah kalau you ada family kan tapi tak close dengan family tu macam like saudara saudara tak tak rapat kan
tapi like um in terms of helping right ya lah like that lah but like like you just have to help your family lah you know
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
lepas tu like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point kan they will like going to get married soon they'll like eh nanti bila kita kahwin uh
kau orang suka tolong-tolong kan nanti kita err kita kahwin kau orang tolong ah this kind of things it's like
I don't think that's how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
ah even when there is a wedding they tak datang on time dia orang datang lambat even the people that they're supposedly close to ah like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin pun datang lambat so I feel like ni apa punya attitude ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin and they're going to breed this kind of
job but err my step mum ada lah tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak then I'm like ya cukup cukup cukup
tapi like I told you before right like my father memang apa macam babi like you know like he fucking like um tengok
tengok youtube every single day pukul
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to mengaji then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that ustazah he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I ustazah say lah like like you know like
err perlahan-perlahan lah baca lah kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau err perlu err ulang lah lagi tapi I cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main video saya tak boleh concentrate lepas tu ustazah macam awkward lah macam oh okay
for me right my my bapa is
macam pemalas jer gila babi tau
like satu dia like dah lama tak kerja and he's just err waiting for government to give him money
and then like um err what do you call that like dia tengok youtube videos every single day pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh on kuat-kuat until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
um electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar
dia tak nak kerja then um ya then I just keep quiet lah like it's your problem what I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever lah you know
err he got his heartbroken and dia dia nak console lah kawan dia lah
lepas tu kawan dia punya crush
err slept with eh will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me lah I like dia tu bukan you punya girlfriend couple dia punya crush sahaja you you nak sad sad lepas tu you nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam
you nak um act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
do you know what my father say he say um oh jadi kalau kalau adik kalau um pergi keluar dengan dia eh nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja coke ke apa ke
lepas tu macam mana you tak darah up kan so I darah up I cakap
kalau nak kalau nak ah jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap
err dia cakap dia macam nak weekend excuse lah macam dia joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
lepas tu what the
ya I mean like fuck man like dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak my father lah dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia lah pemalas
put clothes in the the washing machine and then err gantung which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like kerja um kemas rumah masak lipat baju makingkan dia kopi
I mean mm tapi kalau you old school kan you kerja apa
jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi tau and then I even have like I'm working with a guy um this pakcik he's about seventy plus seventy two
dia masih kerja I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty lah this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to macam kasih dia duit you know what you mean lepas tu I tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab I tengok dia unproductive I rasa macam beban tau like
oh kakak you know err we were talking about how when you die right and then um um
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the bumi right
my step mum cakap dia tak nak jumpa my bapa
ya lah so in bumi you ada mark like husband and wife right tapi in syurga you nak you you still want to be together or not
ah my mum say tak nak myself say
I can see sometimes he's caring but ah as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that macam became geram became macam kau dah lah pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau also nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa
lagipun right half of our lives he never raise us and huh correct dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak expect kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke correct
I mean we don't think like that lah tapi my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya so for me right usually kalau I nak kasih I kasih my step mum lebih macam say
he also likes to count people's money mm macam dia cakap oh like your sister mm dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua like berapa ribu lah
lepas tu he like to compare oh kalau your sister kerja dekat singapore the versus your err brother-in-law who's who kerja dekat malaysia dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih I duit macam gitu
like itu yang kasih you marah because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident lah but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right jadi um my step mum yang yang he was refusing to give
because he like calculative say oh you from the kampung you indonesian lah blah blah blah balik kau punya kampung blah blah blah blah blah blah kalau aku tak kahwin kau
like you punya life tak better lah blah blah blah blah
macam gitu sampai sekarang tau dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran kan I tak suka
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you tak nak you nak duit delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother pun macam I rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam my bapa tau like dia selalu dia cakap mm
lepas tu me and my eldest sister we're like kau boleh born dalam poor family tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya problem
allah dah kasih kau banyak avenue untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak blame orang lain
and like err play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged eh and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that jadi I feel like wah kenapa eh like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
tak tak tak I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
so macam I don't know man it's like
tapi sector macam mana
I tak boleh I teach drama and english before
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like oh I'm just contend with sederhana which I cannot relate to
poyo siol
yang you yang you yang you what um apa tu err this this answer thing is it like um it's like a notes for the exam lah
but I would say it's because of err bumiputera but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay mm there's a difference
it's cheap what you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people lah like I tell you before right macam kalau you nak beli benda sana kalau you tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana
I keluarkan lima puluh ringgit I bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk shampoo is tak memadai it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
dia tu yang yang itu lah yang err text you yang tanya is you
ah kau memang dasar orang melayu
kau yang babi eh nak orang putih padahal kau hitam babi
sawo matang oh okay
mm kan you punya suara kan macam abang-abang pun
macam apa number one candidate untuk orang kahwin lah
ah you tak bilang
eh tu tak fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people
ah nanti you you tunjuk I ada gambar
tapi you tapi you
pergi keluar dengan kawan right like another guy right
kita jadi in ah kita jadi in pasal kita use triggered jadi budak kecil
ah tiga minute lah
tapi um I feel that kalau you excel very real like you will be like top top one top five percent maybe they can offer you like uh there are some companies would like sought you out you know then like um give you accommodation and all that and then get you to stay there to work for them
tapi um
okay today good day for you semua okay
location penting but
provided let's say there's no more COVID there's no kan macam we can still go down and like there's a lot of eateries museum
hey okay firstly it is not a sports mall a sports mall is actually dekat novena which is to velocity
right secondly it is a mall for all ages and all people from all walks of life so kalau let's say you're a foodie there's lot of places
to go to let's say you are very hip and you like there's a place for you too and let's say you are you are someone yang macam suka
macam gini ah
I am stating the facts of the funan mall and I am I like that mall I mean you dah pernah pergi dia punya rooftop right and the views from there thanks to me who brought you what do you say about that
aiya ya my one of my friend pun tried to go up there dengan kawan dia juga then macam eh okay
but actually kalau view from the top of parliament is actually lawa juga cuma I think only special people or special circumstances allows you to use the drone macam gitu ke
but wah kalau
your drone kena shoot down seh kalau you fly
mm betul juga
I just read this article um one of the big hotel chains also tak ingat apa nama hotel itu ah so they are offering
ya tak ingat
do you think mothership articles are like legit and kita boleh percaya
hmm macam
what I feel is that the mothership feels like SGAG kind tapi they are more seniors I tak pasti
is this going to be a funny answer ataupun serious answer
okay I'll make a guess mungkin SGAG
well as compared to my point of view macam I follow both SGAG and mothership on their social media so
wow so old fashion macam zaman-zaman dulu bapa bapa
tapi checkers macam
wait dam
oh dam lah okay okay
cause sampai sekarang kan I don't know the difference between dam dengan chess wait chess is the one dengan the horses things right
oh okay dam yang bulat itu yes okay my grandfather pun main dam
ya sometimes I katak bawah tempurung
so uh your grandfather your ada ada the dam
checker board yang dam itu
your family ada
a bit yes macam dulu-dulu pernah lah like you know someone taught me I think my grandparents or
come on this time of night you want to play this kind of games diam please
where were we oh tadi cakap pasal dam
dam is the one yang macam
um there's waves actually alhamdulillah
I tanya pasal apa I tanya pasal dam okay okay
oh jadi yang kotak putih itu is like supposed to be like non-existent
so let's say ada dua player right so I'm player one you're player two so I
put my pieces on the black boxes tapi you put the pieces on the white
okay faham faham
you cannot move back tapi boleh move forward
ya betul itu
nanti you shiok sendiri
come on lah maybe I just I perempuan seh
do you know last I think I dengar pasal mister softee is like
sekarang slurpee jer lah masih ada
or certain um outlets sahaja
eh jangan gitu lah
kita boleh cakap english dengan melayu jer tau okay
oh my god talking about mister softee now I feel like eating ice cream macam mana ini walao
cerita apa ah
ah boleh lah sikit penat
ya lah ngantuk lah cause sometimes you know
oh ya we were talking about the online thing then your online classes yang photography videography itu how is it going
oh no macam mana itu
exactly exactly betul itu
anyway machine ini dah dah
spoiled and karat yes
honestly I don't even know what is singer oil and apa benda itu and what is the usage and function of it

that building that land is is been there for a while lah macam you know
dia dah um refurbish and upgrade is it
um when I was in school macam doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening macam at that point of time we don't feel it lah obviously cause we too young
to experience it tapi
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so macam more comfortable
ya do they still find it macam alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore macam cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me kan kalau
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself pula on my own
with my parents et cetera macam it feels very alien
I pergi tempat lain gitu it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless macam
no other places in singapore make you feel janggal like out of place except sembawang
macam you make your own decisions and stuffs
levels like what period in time of your life macam you
five years five right lima
no dark past I'm digging out from you you're safe okay tak zilch
also I think ya I think pun like for me I was in poly what so macam we were like what eighteen nineteen right
tapi kan if we were in sec four we were sixteen
you secondary school cuma
no mana boleh hey hello

perk up the spirits perk up the spirits tau jangan macam gini lah
but it ya we didn't kita tak close pun anyways so macam
acquaintance too young to learn the word acquaintance back then tapi that's the fact
actually I didn't have a lot of good memories dekat

you literally just nak leave singapore just for the sake of it after all this
rehat and relax at the R&R

I asked around lah I said how to go for audition right untuk apa ni how to start theatre how to do theatre
eh no no I didn't go audition I attend the workshop first it was a free workshop on sunday kat sub station so then lepas tu ya lah every week I go attend workshop I do I learn about acting
and then apa tu uh one day like uh my first appearance on stage was as a human prop
somehow they get somebody cause kita free kan they get us to just lie there
like in the middle of the show lah before intermission one of the character cakap what the character say macam oh who is this you know then after that reveal lah so like wah a dead body
until the end everybody dah balik
but ya lah because cannot cannot move what so my kaki semut semut you know
but then kaki semut semut you cannot move right so you need to learn macam your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise yang how hard it was until um they got a review lah somebody wrote a review then cakap
complain lah they complain banyak banyak about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
cakap about the best potrayal was the portrayal
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing bila I think got this one uh kakak melayu
orang rupanya so she was like she was surprised yang she so she was shocked lah to realise actually I was a real person lah so okay
um mula mula so not wrapped ah macam dorang ada cover dengan kain gitu ah
ah no no no no no as in so dia macam apa tu
my there will be a set kan kat belakang tu ada macam ada the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me lah ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that lah so I
so my leg actually boleh lah my leg can move but then err just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
um then no we were like training what we wanted macam training then after that apa tu um second show I was
stage managing I was helping and then after that um the actor problem lah tak tak selalu tak datang lah apa tu hangover lah blah blah blah then after that the director cakap
there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just apa tu um can you just
and then my director macam wah I never knew you can act eh so then she text me then say okay then next time um can you take over his role lah because he's very problematic
but simpan tak
actually itu ah what is influencer
ya actually it's true ah that time where I so geram you know pasal apa tu I got I was trying to promote one of the my programs lah when I was doing coordinating work right I was coordinating apa tu um
her Facebook posts one Facebook post and one Instagram post ya and itu pun bukannya dia macam uh she write any oh no
she actually she wrote something but dia punya her posts were so funny because
the after that post is very hard to track whether apa tu yang the
your your press conference eh no press kit no bukan apa
apa lah
your post bukan they put on theirs right
is it like some of the comments dorang cakap apa
mm mm habis
tak tidur ah kau
tu pun kirakan macam apa tau macam branding kan
eh apa tu number
company apa nak buat uh
what have you thought about apa tu your branding about your selling point eh apa ni bising bising

perlahan-lahan sikit boleh tak ai okay okay okay tak apa um
kecoh lah okay patut boleh quiet tapi dorang semua
company okay you wanted to sell apa tu nak jual buka kedai
can jangan lupa nak kena code switch sikit eh nak kena code switch melayu okay
bagus lah bagus lah so ah it's
selling marketing tu yang paling the difficult at the moment actually nak buat
one person said to me lah nak apa tu kalau nak
nak buat business senang
cuma nak sustain tu ya nak sustain
apa yang orang nak orang pun semua macam very fickle
hmm what do you mean tak faham
orang yang bayar ya
dia punya dia punya sense orbit lah the fashion sense
not bad so siapa yang jual I mean siapa yang buat
where you manufacture you jahit sendiri
pandai mana kau dapat suruh contact contact sebegini
kena ajar juga eh sometimes okay
but from dari kecil from growing up you really wanted to do this ah
apa lah tak apa
engkau memang yes
apa apa yang cons dia
mati cepat in in what sense
apa car crash eh apa uh plane crash
apa apa juga pun kalau dah ajal like what you say lah
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay lah is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a um apa doktor badut dorang panggil um
no lah I think growing up I very you cannot decide lah nowadays also I also think about it kita we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
power ranger then I was like okay lah boleh lah power ranger but you know
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist pasal my gigi berterabuh
my gigi I think fall down and then uh I all of my front teeth semua macam
hitam tau like pasal I think it it was chipped and then after that ada ada darah stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
I think it was because I was sick then I realise ugh you know what if only I can become a doctor and then um I just got the idea from a lot people lah one thing I wanted to become scientist also pasal that time pergi madrasah then after that my ustazah cakap apa
err kalau ada lalat tu kan lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul
kepak dia tu kan satu one side kepak dia ada uh
what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other punya kepak tu ada
dia punya antidote penawar dia the medicines I want to say who ah I I'm curious ah
which side of the of the kepak of the lalat tu yang mana satu toxic yang mana satu what
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I kena punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
so dia cakap macam eh macam cool eh korang apa ni what you do performance and I enjoy that lah but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
pasal to get into medicine here at that time ah for me you need to get straight four A's
geram seh but anyway ya
so ya lah and err I remember my teacher you know mister yaz telling me to like eh bila ya lah where are you going to
just drop one subject lah just drop one subject because they were they care so much about apa ni dia punya school punya standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible lah so ya but then in the end I just decided to
this person tak boleh ajar ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say eh you are actually quite good ah uh
ya tapi tu tu show ada banyak problem seh
but the problem also not not not related to me lah pasal dia punya management lah they don't know how to sell the show they making lots of money even now you know a lot of people uh some of the
macam last time also I was pakai fikir apa tu alah nak buat like I always have this embarrassment tau kalau everytime kita buat show kan
how much to sell the tickets for then when you sell ticket alamak macam too much lah too expensive lah like I don't think people will want or like cannot afford cannot afford because we will we care about
the uh apa tu
bila kita calculate the budget
cannot it doesn't make sense we are losing in the end in the end we are not even err we are actually give it like say as if it's charity because we where we pay for other stuff we have to pay macam
you'll get loss lah rugi ah
okay noted tiga puluh minit oh wow
cannot decide ah kalau makanan makanan nak kena lit ah
dia teh tarik is always my actually I'm addicted to teh tarik it cannot kalau tak ada tak ada the teh tarik cannot
like even kalau
kat india okay lah not bad ah that time I was in bangalore
dorang kan ada dorang punya apa tu yang masala chai so and things like that so okay lah itu kelakar because
kecil kecil so I always like tak cukup I have to keep on buying and buying and buying later so in the end I came I said oh I saw they have this bigger cup for other drinks ah terus cakap can I have
boleh because dia dia tak ada the pricing tau for that thing so they just like anyhow give me a price so I said I don't mind then the next day I said even that not enough I brought my own water bottle I want your masala chai in my water bottle
chai just means tea that's why when we play scene when you when you say chai tea eh siapa tu
oh kita pause
kejap as we pick up some delivery
okay sambung balik
banyak distraction lah delivery lah
kau punya phone jangan mati eh dia okay ah
apa aku cakap oh ya okay lah so I think kalau makanan what favourite food I will eat
okay lah kalau drink teh tarik kalau makanan I don't know
I like nasi ambeng but I don't think I can eat nasi ambeng hari hari
buat selama-lamanya mm oh maybe okay lah kalau okay kalau nak fikirkan right I think
if I were to really strategise it something yang healthy
I don't know maybe protein shake ah not protein shake lah the one the one yang ada all the all the meals like
it's for survival dia macam okay you remember you watch matrix you know the yang dorang makan benda apa benda tu
then the guy was saying like um they were in the they were in a vessel uh but then after that they will makan some like some bubur or like porridge ke apa benda
dia cakap oh this is all this is everything that you need for your health that thing ah
um nasi ambeng maybe uh I don't know
for lunch nasi ambeng ah maybe something else
okay let's see what other prompts dorang kasi
promosi oh promosi beli satu percuma satu apakah yang paling teruk okay
ya lah maksudnya kalau macam
eh kau kan dulu kecil kecil ada belajar tu
hmm apa benda tak elok
dia ada batin batin ada dia kan ada kat masjid en-naeem kan
like that you bilang you bilang ibu ah
tengok ah
I also not so sure pasal to me dia macam nampak macam dancing
haven't melayu semua melayu silat
apa tak explain sikit
buka bunga apa open open flower open flower
so it's about really respect lah adat adat adat
okay then kalau martial arts what martial arts you want to learn
apa eh
the flying the flying arm bar I remember dia ajar macam mana nak buat flying arm bar
ni masih uni ah I think because
doing merepek-merepek stuff
because I did I do film school right so he study apa tu
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps ah then I okay then aku more to learn lah then he show me a flying arm bar
ya ya ya so macam mana I got the video ah choreo but I remember it was uh
like ya ya so you you hook on to the tangan and then after that one of the kaki will
ya gitu sekali banyak kali ah that move actually they look a lot dekat apa tu what a lot of the fightings sequences lah that kind of hollywood
pasal okay so now eh do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know uh I was baca lah pasal okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you ah kalau macam all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend ah think of uh somebody you jumpa every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person tanya okay ayisha uh can I uh macam stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
eh oh okay gitu jer eh
kalau an asker
they know dorang tahu yang apa tu if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
two weeks macam
not as lama lah but they will say like how how could this person even
how dare they ask me like that question asal dia tak fikir pasal so there's a lot of like issues that come with it pasal
you either macam
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks dia macam kurang ajar lah very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
got the hull invert um because they think like ada
but for so that's a point on guesser lah so I realised kita
there's a yes or no um people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why ah apa motive kau eh what is it for faham tak
um macam for example lah
uh oh aku perasan apa yang you leave your
that that apa tu yang
if it is a western country I think boleh lah
but they don't understand apa tu yang
uh dorang tak faham
impian eh
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk apa ni
it's okay sekiranya anda harus menyerah segala-galanya bagi mengejar impian anda apakah yang akan anda risikokan malay>kau ni melayu dia

beratur like satu jam dua jam ah but this one
for their own ubat ah they cannot what cannot wait you know you see that's the difference ah
you know now COVID nineteen right so macam banyak
ya I don't want to find like some kerja itu semua
can freelance but I also can like you know I can kerja like under a creative studio or
what should I do because when it's COVID nineteen semua benda macam
semakin menurun so I've been thinking about internship
because I'm I do macam you know the video ambil ambil video kat kat video ah I do like
poster poster buat buat poster but for their events
but it's just that my designs macam I my direction
not how to say ah macam
tak ya bagus bagus design sangat it's just
lesser design elements so macam tak berapa
I were to be versatile or what I think I need to like macam gain experience
closer closer to what I'm what I want to do lah you know what I mean like magazine editorial ke apa ke you know
ya ya but like mm it's a bit hard especially COVID nineteen lah like what I'm saying macam dah dah ada ni penyakit semua it's like it's hard to even go out it's hard to
that are related to my career it's more to like macam survive ah like tak ada duit you know like you know like now like
err I feel quite sad lah like sekarang zaman sekarang our our like generation like
survival ya so you just take whatever lah ambil jer like what else
masak masak kan ah ah masak masak so like even now your I feel like your industry also kena affected mah
what what we the future future contain cause like I feel like COVID nineteen kan kan dia teach you how to humble down and like
around you at the moment so like live the moment you know ya macam kalau you plan your jauh pun then your plan not
go to plan then like you will feel upset something then macam nak give up gitu kan so
I just hope for the best but not too much don't expect too much that kind of thing but like I feel like if we do out best in in anything I think boleh lah boleh lah we can make it lah
ya budak budak sekarang like okay I would say like now there's a lot of like
there's a lot of new things maybe like new food or what that kind of thing like for example bazaar you know this ramadhan can't go like mosque or what
yes it's also affected kan so macam a lot of
and like how to say I feel so macam deprived gitu macam tak ada orang nak cakap it's not that I
aku selalu actually middle actually aku ambivert ah
aku actually ambivert but basically I choose if I want to
like but now I prefer to be alone ah but it's just the people that I macam nak
siapa siapa yang I'm close to I want to just just meet them like okay I have a few other friends with it I think like I'm sure you
ya so macam ya now I'm introverted and I'm not mad about it but it's just that
since we're in our house macam kita kat duduk kat rumah kan it's more like oh sometimes we are so blinded macam
more changes to more ya progress to like macam make singapore more
like the quality semua ke apa kan like more err out there
macam kau yes correct correct
macam tak like tak ramai sangat yang
setuju um I don't know what I'm talking ah but like they don't agree
ingrained already it's like oh eh um aku dah apa I'm already like brought up this way from my
parents I need to be this way that kind of thing so they're a bit stubborn macam
degil sangat lah you know what again but I really hope that
they start to macam open up sikit and then more or less
what rakyat you know caring you know like I hope singapura macam
I don't know economic macam image you know like how macam singapore nak
that like banyak banyak gaps a lot of gaps
so aku lapar sial aku lapar sial like
you know I'm lapar I don't know what to eat also
but it was not bad and I found out that it's actually halal because the the is new
there's no halal sign so I asked actually halal it's just that it's processing the
now you just kau dah apa kau dah shift aku punya ah mindset sekarang to pasta
ya I don't know uh macam dah lama sangat
that one is like kita punya own timing punya break
I'm not a person who'd bangun pagi oh my god
I want to because is it yang mcgriddles tu dah dah
sedap seh I feel it's very nice eh but I'm like
sorry McDonald's kenapa kau selalu bagi mcgriddles macam sikit sikit jer
ya macam betul seriously sia
but uh everytime after makan breakfast I will tend to have diarrhoea sakit perut
the mcgriddles punya I think the heavy one is the egg one
ya ada
boleh boleh ah boleh ah boleh ah tak lah kat secondary secondary
actually I can recall almost banyak ah
I don't know ah chill eh kejap let me think let me think
okay lepas tu
my I join err apa ni floorball
ya macam C division itu semua B division
other orang yang macam dah tahu main floorball
to macam beli stick itu semua ah so I made my own stick
ya I did ah I used macam sapu kau tahu penyapu dia punya yang wood tu ya
but I use a normal you know kiddy ball macam eh kiddy ball
macam budak budak yang kids suka main tu yang bouncy ball
ah I use that as a floorball ball lah then the thing I use use use I play aku practise lah
aku practise practise practise and you know the grip is not nice
floorball stick is softer the grip so ya my hand bengkak
ah I swear aku tak boleh shoot sial aku tak boleh shoot
it will never be a high shot macam shot or low shot gitu so I was so frustrated because the rest could do it
because okay basically kan floorball is macam yang banyak perempuan lawa lawa semua
because they never ajak us ke apa they just let us one side
okay okay tu bagus ah actually
floorball macam collective it's a collective you're in the floorball then you means you're floorball members ah so
then macam okay ah apa set ah then I then I go interview then I like
confirm malam I stay at bedok like jauh kan I was like
that's how I that ah then lah itu lah that's how I ended up in
tapi tak ya I think it's becoming popular because I think we're good at floorball
because I go to I go watch macam tengok tournament itu semua kan some of my friends are in the national team
I don't know like you minah like that eh I don't know why ah I damn scared of you sia
I know okay one thing for sure kau punya idea bagus gila like no joke and some
but that ni but I feel like cause kita tak banyak orang ah tak ah dah tak tak banyak manpower pun ni
points that kind of thing right cause got the apa apa
oh ya okay I feel like itu macam saja macam myth saja it's just to like oh just make you exercise
got music one ah ada music
kau kau join chinese dance is specifically chinese dance saja
bukan ada mix tak
vibing habis sekarang kau tak menari kau tak nak menari kau tak
so sekarang kau macam dance yang K-pop ke apa with your friend ah
eh we should kita mesti dance seh next time
ya but then because I don't know I I'm not good at following macam movement tahu
but kalau free style it's it's no boundaries up to me
but if you had a chance to like like you know like now people do the urban dance get kind of thing maybe like that kind macam gempak pun apa
oh the slow kind ah yang ni macam yang macam you know the ones that the choreography is like
ah kalau hip hop ke gitu okay ah you like you like you
it's that one takes time to appreciate it tak apa tak apa
rugged ah type macam rugged ah
oh tak kisah sangat ah
a bit err just macam sikit ah
then sekarang kau kau nak plan plan pergi university tak
macam mana nak cakap gigs gitu
I need to macam start from the bottom media and not
ya ya ya that's true that's true kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus macam
kau boleh buat banyak benda kau boleh adapt adapt adapt adapt adapt
then kau belajar belajar sekali
but like but that's the thing though I think macam singapore kan dia orang they have like this emphasis on macam
kau mesti bagus at everything but like let's say
architecture okay then you major but nanti they say oh no you have to have good record
now that I think of it last time kan we always macam
oh aku nak jadi orang kaya then when you rethink about it now macam maybe I don't want to be a rich person
under under under under under us lagi you know like this so it's like
ah mata merah
apa bersefahaman eh why is does that sound like a paper kind of
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
oh cannot lah that one is too gila okay maybe I start first
if I got three hajat the first one would be I want to talk to my kucing
cause because I just like like every time I always like talk to my kucing and then I I become like a gila person and I like berbual merepek I legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if I if I can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
but macam fun lah
alamak if macam tu then
but I want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
like kalau I'm given a chance to travel back right I want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya I tak nak apa tu I don't want to travel to the future
cause I takut that if I see macam what my future is
macam I risau lah that my what my actions will
oh ya that's true but okay example lah if if in the future I see that I become doctor and then abeh I I don't know I
okay no no no change change change okay in the future I see that I'm something that I don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then I'll be like oh okay okay ah try to like then I'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like I don't know then it will affect my like what I'm doing right now lah and then macam tak ada thrill if I know that in the end I'll become doctor then
then I'll be demotivated to study cause I know my future like okay lah later I become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
tapi fun lah
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that oh kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup lah tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then I fikir also like betul lah
but if I tidur
sikit sangat also I also ngantuk
ya ya I understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
oh I faham
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh I think I think
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes lah okay not my ayah my ibu
ya I a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah lah
and cut down on the gula-gula
oh wait no maggi goreng
no ada indomie and maggi eh mi sedaap
actually I last time legit suka eh ibumie
ya sedap but then
I don't know why everyone say indomie so I like oh oh okay okay sama sama lah indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
it's like lain sikit
mi sedaap they legit like tak lokek their bawang
but their bawang a bit macam
weird lah cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's I don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
kan maybe it's like bawang but
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
oh I tadi I eat uh briyani
okay lah tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
daging I don't like
what the wait they jual where
I I want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
I feel like pelan-pelan I will I will adapt to it
and like what you know during the time I go up to to to aqil to ask for the gambar
and then imagine I I tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me I'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
actually takde power yang
yang I don't know
is ada hikmahnya that
um ada udang sebalik ini semua
tak pernah eh
I legit tak pernah dengar
apa eh let me think
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik lah if you don't already have it
what is the one okay wait I read in malay also okay sabar sabar eh
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
alasan that is paling like is okay
I can think of one alasan that is very remeh
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah eh tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham kan ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek lah
kan kan macam nak sepak jer kan
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
wah that one I tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
apakah genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent um drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
I think I faham a bit
is it macam
okay it's not really genre lah but okay as you know lah I suka like anime like recently like I watch a lot of anime
like why I like anime is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! I don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu lah but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya lah like anime
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham lah it's like
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the anime their their plot macam very exciting and very fun lah cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
kan macam
eh just ask me I can tolong ask rina also
I added I follow your adik and she legit so funny
oh my god my adik also you know my adik is like like very young
and he type macam legit like budak zaman sekarang like you know you know how you type macam oo whoa whoa
and the thing is he's a lelaki you know so when like sometimes I I tengok they way he type or he hantar me message and I legit sometimes macam a bit disgusted
ya and and his macam ejaan is lain you know like you know when you um eja like no is N O he eja like N U U U U U so it's nuuuuu
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat lah kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
if duit is percuma then
I want mm I want bubble tea to be percuma
then I can rasa I can rasa all the different flavours
because sekarang I just keep buying the brown sugar fresh milk
you know I baru beli the sandals right
and then tadi I keluar lah I went ikea and apa tu it was like a bit scary cause I don't know I don't know why like when I pakai the sandals it feels like like high heels or something
ya ya and I takut it will cabut so I was like I was like trying to macam walk slowly and it looks a bit weird my mother was like eh jalan betul-betul lah
don't know cause apa tu sebelum tu I had uh one pair of rubi shoes and it actually like lasted quite lama lah
ya cause kadang-kadang it's only until forty
that's a bit kesian
oh oh my god I benci when when like they always look at me like I want to curi something
if it's just what like how I'm acting I think I was acting macam biasa jer
tapi legit menyampah
maybe they kena force to do it
actually kan if they if they tak cakap welcome then that means they just diri kat situ and stare at you so maybe that's why they welcome welcome
oh I did I did okay apa ah I actually just bought like baju
and seluar and kasut ah cause like tak ada banyak benda that I need and I
I'm actually cause I look at my wardrobe and like I got so many baju that I don't really pakai all the time
and it's like I simpan it's just cause I simpan cause I sayang you know I don't want to I don't want to buang
then I keep macam telling myself dah tak apa lah next time can use but
I don't actually pakai it lah so so I like
chose some baju that I want to give away and I'm giving away to rina cause she
she tanya lah ya and then but from eleven eleven ah what
I bought two jeans one white one black then I also beli ah two blouse ya one white and then is another blouse and then I also bought skincare which is apa tu ya
ya ya correct and the kasut lah
the hitam one the kasut is actually very nice
I actually nak pergi typo cause I want to buy some stuff from typo

eh I I tak faham why I always so penat
like I sleep for apa like dua belas jam also I still can be so penat
wait you bangun pukul berapa
so actually I bangun pukul I bangun pukul lapan and then I
uh I tried to do stuff until pukul dua belas then pukul dua belas I went out mm I went out to ikea
macam chemical

ya actually macam takde apa-apa nak buat kat situ
tapi tadi I went there right and there was only like families
macam takde takde orang pergi dating ke takde budak-budak
mmhmm kan eh we also going skating right I a bit takut cause I tak tahu macam mana nak skate and then
okay dulu lah when I was like kecil like very young long time ago I I use the skates like the the that skates lah the fat one the wheels are very fat right
ya and then I jatuh you know and then I didn't skate anymore
no no no it's the roller blade the apa tu the roda is tajam right but then the skate the skating the indoor skating that we're going is the roda is like roundish and fat
so I a bit takut to go skating
I just tarik all of you down
I I think the the apa tu yang the round wheels right is harder to balance
ya cause like example ah you diri and then if you diri too straight then you can jatuh eh
ya you can jatuh backwards or if you sandar right you can jatuh also that's how I jatuh last time
oh my god I don't even kemas my bilik
I want to beli you know the like the mirror that is like panjang
but I also want to install you know kipas on the wall cause my kipas now is kat lantai
like cause I need to tarik my kipas everywhere cause
I'm panas then sometimes tertrip on the wire over the wire ya and my kipas also tak kuat sangat
cause now our window grille kan like we need to pasang the the mesh if not like our kucing can escape
ya so we want buy the grille that is like tak besar sangat so the kucing can like no need cannot escape lah
and we no need to pasang the mesh cause now like we all the windows got the mesh
ya no no no it's only the top and then the mesh like tangkap all the bulu
ya so we malas to bersihkan so we just change the window
eh when we keluar on the nineteen we should go to fatburgers
fatburgers ya is a apa tu sign
I think huda want to makan fatburger
no but apparently it's sedap
kat ang mo kio ada I think
oh ya kan kan tapi COVID so tak banyak ah
ya ya that time also I go then like a bit kosong and it was ya I think it was a weekend also cause usually banyak orang sampai tak boleh jalan or something ya but it was kosong ah
apa eh jap
you have one child but you have another one percuma oh
huh that's that's a bit gila
actually twins twins a bit fun when you grow up how many anak you want to have
your apa tu parents very cute
I mean they still muda
my my ibu and ayah they kahwin when they were twenty eight
ya and it's actually my my ibu still schooling cause she
she join like madrasah lambat lah and then she want to like continue islamic studies
so like like she like she never even kerja after she kahwin eh after she kahwin pula she never kerja after she like belajar
so after she belajar which is like she finish twenty eight then my ayah already macam apa simpan duit for how many years already so he sponsor everything
he sponsor the majlis the honeymoon all and then they kahwin at twenty eight but then they ambil like four years to get like my abang
so like they got my abang at thirty two
and you know they tunang for how long
they tunang for six years
dekat huh ya usually orang tunang apa dua tahun
eh I want to kahwin someone baik someone baik someone kacak someone
kalau boleh lah tapi tak boleh kan takpe
can ask nabilah nabilah got buat tu before
you want to berhenti here
how cause I very like macam my friends also like I buka ah
continue ah your story curi how how did he get away with that
the audacity adik curi daripada bapa
macam mana you dapat though
I think some kedai like some shop they will ask some shops tak kesah that one best kalau like if your muka then they like ya ambil lah wah
how I cannot I don't know like I got like macam masih you know ya
like I go I my I sprained my ankle then got like headline fracture then I kind of cannot play sports now then like I feel very insecure like you know because the thing is right macam pasal body like when you are like bigger in size but then you you play sports or what but then when you play sports what did I say oh ya then I stop ah cause I fracture then like the thing is like you know when you are bigger in size
and then but then like when you tak buat apa-apa then like they will just keep on attacking you the same you know like just now we talked about all the aunties seventy year old is like what the hell dude but then you like when you have something macam like if you dance dance is also a sport right or play other sports they will like not say or like you can will just skip one or thirty you wanted to say you know like just now we talk about
say something back but then ya makcik makcik sekarang tak tahu like ya they not it's like bukan tegur it's like menyindir then I'm like wow oh really ah your parents like that
especially in front of other relatives tu aku sakit hati betul oh my god correct not even secretly that is oh my god ya
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them nak kereta I mean like ya oh sorry I don't know what I mean I don't understand like
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry ah I quite shocked ah but alhamdulillah at least he got there I mean macam token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just risau then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior macam tukar macam sergeant kau then kalau nak buat benda like he can macam threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can macam move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you nampak the news baru keluar like ah this chinese man
dia freaking like molest budak kecil perempuan and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is macam kalau nak cakap pasal sexual cases like harassment kat singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of para muslim say that like alah but then like maki alah also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism macam dia tak nak apa-apa religion at all kat dalam dia orang country or tak nak individualism kat dalam country dia orang also dia orang tak nak ah tudung semua tak nak which I don't understand because other people from other religion macam nuns tu semua
because they tutup also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya dia kata dia tak suka hijab cause we look scary
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot lah macam aku boleh err macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant dia orang tak kesah but the thing is even if you tak kesah or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need oh really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
ya I think cause of our agama also cause you know nabi muhammad he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot agama and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world kita dalam bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so selesa and comfortable dalam singapore then when you like tak kesah
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and apa lagi like just perangai dia orang ah I'm wanna believe is adolescence but macam bodoh apa like kalau kau tengok balik they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of mak minah scares me ya scare me like dulu dulu is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion ah tapi sekarang macam I see them like throwing maki ah mak kau
mak kau ya is just uncomfortable lah to tengok like the younger generation
is very sedih ya macam kalau cause the thing is um like the older generation tak nak pergi I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we kalau kau tengok the younger generation aku macam err like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
apa dia buat ni ah
honestly I don't even think you are a minah you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they fikir just because then they feel macam
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something ah is not even tegur is like sindir like asal kau I'm like um sorry sally like like you know like asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau I'm like um I'm trying my best you know like the way they tegur is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to jaga hati or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you ungkitkan balik I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context macam apa ni bodoh like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit ah a bit sometimes they a bit too proud ah of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up macam dulu aku kecil-kecil how ah I don't know lah
wow congratulations wow masuk jannah esok but I've met some people that dia orang err like hafal al quran all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I tersinggung sikit sebab I tak boleh hafal but like you know there's no need to
I come after you eh aku baru habis khatam tau kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam like wow and usually is like not saying what ah but is the madrasah kids pun macam gitu ya and then they
eh I don't know cakap bahasa arab aku macam okay thanks oh my god ya oh my god ya is it like sometimes aku like just fikir and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by cemburu or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like macam it just like sakit hati the way they talk to us is like that
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you khatam like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang not even about quran or what like just in life general macam
dia lari empat round you you baru lari dua round then you just say oh I finished eight rounds macam gitu you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang vlogging vlogging tu kan okay
I only have one girl friend that ada lesen motor and she bawa scooter ya comel bodoh and is very is the lah like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that ah
okay sorry I didn't know it's comel at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like hujan a bit difficult though ya mm ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the besar one just like five K starting price
wow dah fikir jauh sister
mm ah inshallah actually study like last month you know COVID COVID the thirty five guest should have went for it lagi murah really I have like some friends and cousins actually only a friend and two cousins
kahwin during so they only invite dua puluh lima orang then the others like online it was like cheap not cheap ah but like compared to what the malays you know malay weddings are so expensive sis you dah save you wanted to get married twenty two
kalau ada jodoh then it will happen
but wow I'm betul-betul cannot believe that you like dah plan I'm like wow cause like bila cakap online like you're eighteen I'm like cool she's still a student too I'm like she's still around that eighteen age wow
wait you ambil berapa course kat mana how much is it ah I heard private course like expensive what did you sit for like apa you belajar
same same industry also um how you cari course like this oh
but I think like your course and dia punya timing betul-betul chun like cause of the pandemic betul-betul cari like orang apa ni like healthcare people ya they cari ya ya so that was the timing was nice but the pandemic no lah
tak nak try hospital like oh okay okay
oh that's a bit leceh
untuk kahwin okay okay sorry sorry
is he oh no not reservist right oh okay okay sorry sorry I mean how old is your that one oh okay okay kat tekong
yeah oh okay is that a lot I have friends that habis satu kotak like one kotak per day like how what the fuck oh wow isn't it like mahal because I have friends also they pokgai pun masih nak beli rokok
ya then kalau tak pinjam I don't understand the
pinjaming the satu batang satu batang thing it's so funny like halfway through class satu batang K minggu depan okay
cause like my family is don't smoke like my parents tak smoke langsung then when I masuk poly then I'm like to me culture shock cause um none of my friends like close friends smoke but poly oh my god everybody whenever you turn somebody is smoking and like
wow aku macam quite shock nampak dia orang as kelakar to me but like to them is a norm but dah biasa is so cute like minggu depan aku bagi kau balik like wow
comel that's legit selling seh I never see the photo legit wow smart smart no ah no lah
oh my god then they tell the anak-anak look down look down lower your gaze tutup mata scary seh oh man ya
I know some girl friends will be like chill sister I do not want your mat tahir
anak siapa tu astaga
same like like rilek-rilek ya ya macam sendu ours apa sia minah-minah ni
then like they refunded to me aku malas nak register balik and then now online registration got registration fee like online fee I think it's like three dollars or four dollars aku macam I don't want lah I gemar cara
but private mahal ya motorbike but actually I learn how to I don't think is illegal cause my family has like houses like in indonesia then we also have family there then sometimes we just ride the motor there like they teach us lah so technically
I can bawa already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who takde lesen then they just bawa motor they just bawa as long as you tak kena tangkap
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends lah like you know they just bawa takde lesen as long as you tak tangkap is okay takut risky
no but you can beli motor tak lesen
can like my friend no err family member that can pay you see my friend um jual his motor to this kid he haven't even get his license
then he dah dah letak nama dia bayar dah dah ambil dah budak tu I don't know if he has his license already lah but at first when he beli takde I don't know how he gonna learn also cause of like circuit breaker last time but at least he is learning now
but ya but don't lah don't it's illegal illegal don't do illegal things you smoke like cold or hot ya I can smell it why honestly bila my friends cakap pasal ni aku tak but they said got the feeling the feeling
they said hot sakit berat berat is it what you say heavier ah
but you know one brand like gudang garam that one like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like bawa ke sekolah and then they spread ah ya like I don't know how they supply dapat like that day budak ni bawa tu macam
you know when they jual it then that thing you know then dia kasi kasi orang I don't know if they beli or what ah but I'm just like very curious macam mana korang dapat ni semua especially when they are underage and then beli
I mean eh that's a huge flex eh you want to like minum bandung I want to drink bandung in bandung like wow I mean if
you had the money like takde feeling there ah makan french fries kat singapore
you want like just keep quiet right and then tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang why is it quiet ah
kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba like ah budak ni tak nak kasi duit mm mm inshallah
kasi surprised kasi us another surprise
tapi feel like banyak though on the other side apa sia budak-budak ni
I mean who doesn't duit tu siapa tak nak though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche semua nak buat like orang cina-cina you know like the youtubers siapa ni I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel lah in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast melayu like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start ah then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know err malay podcast usually talk about agama like a lot of it
I pusing so no lah eh I only ever seen like those ya but that one is like tiga puluh sen like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that one you pass around your friends
lighter kau ada lighter tak lighter aku dah habis ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but aku tak dengar banyak macam success story for melayu that's like wow you know
mm I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya untuk anjing ah I mean that's for them ah that's a niche for them but like aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya community diam jer
kan kan aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan though
no I think like when we send it to them then dia orang akan dengar and I think cause cause the video they show dalam form like changing changing the code switching that one I think they akan belajar to like analyse the way we cakap
interesting ah macam I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit lah how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like campur is usually one one like ya around me lah is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the bahasa ibunda I'm like bro
ya betul betul
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore hijab
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered bak kwa before I'm like 我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren no bak kwa for me no oink oink for me sweetie
but like the err chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if kalau tu bukan apa ni reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
not that not that crunchy right compared to but still very nice especially the kentang the whipped potato
okay lah tak tak sedap sangat ah to my taste
okay lah both I think preference wise I tak choosy ah both
sedap very crunchy very nice I think it depends on your mood hari tu kalau you rasa your taste
ah okay lah christmas eve lah christmas christmas dah nak dekat seh nak boleh order dia punya christmas bundle I'm looking for turkey ataupun lamb shank
the halal lamb shank sedap seh but then now I don't see ah lamb shank
I only see the meat loaf and lamb rack I want the shank macam
oh that's very nice apa
ah dia punya cake not bad I'm looking forward for the christmas for the thanksgiving
sayang seh I don't think so there's christmas
tak boleh buat gathering pe because of this COVID nineteen
thanksgiving nampaknya kena postpone ah
iya lah lepas tu tak boleh
buat gathering seh ramai-ramai
restricted ah nak buat gathering chalet tak boleh
mask we can collected tak tahu eh kat vending machine nearest vending machine nearer to our home
oh like that then good lah at least we got the new masks to use seh mask kita semua dah macam very ah lunyai
you shouldn't be washing in washing machine hand wash and and dry because you keep washing the same I mean the mask kita dapat
then tu lah dah teruk dia punya mask okay lah if it's we got a new one then not that bad ya by the way ah dah school holiday kan

mm fabric paint mahal ke
lebih banyak save kalau nak beli tapi kalau kalau unless if you thought of doing colouring masks tu nak jual to your friend ke you can promote dekat mana then worth buying the fabric mask ah you can give it a try then you can do your art to show off dekat kau punya mask tu pelitup muka kau

like that time ada thing but then in the end she managed to go also pe
ya lah ngok
serious ah asal
ah selalu gitu oh my god girl you want me to get started on christina and ulfa eh no salah nama christina and insha
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them ada boyfriend kan however the thing with insha is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird sebab macam it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
and like macam okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like macam you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay insha did to christina so on like
she she said that macam kalau in terms of apa
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina tapi ya that's not how it is
dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar together they did a double date lepas tu azhari didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why azhari didn't pay for it but then akif paid for it like christina punya boyfriend he paid for insha punya cable car ride

dah dah okay
okay sini sini
mana kau punya web WhatsApp
ah aku belum synchronise
uh twenty nine but I tak terjun botol punya orang sebab I I don't know because that time I rasa macam I terjun botol when you actually uh proposed to me right I rasa macam like the happiest girl on earth lor then macam
macam semak because the thing is that um it's not very often for me to get um
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like macam those people who idiots people lah but then uh
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old wah sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi ha ya so
I rasa macam I think this the right time for us to get married
but remember that time we kena kena tipu
the for our kad jemputan
to your mother also lah from actually stopped me also mak mak stopped me
I actually oh the next one the problem was uh the kalau the tak nak nyanyi eh tak nak show up we got the best tau he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
huh ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer lah then that caterer also say um I don't know lah he's like that lah the perangai macam apa lah gitu so I was like macam ah merepek seh perangai
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude macam siak so macam uh eventually I
call I I try to find kat facebook tengok ada tak siapa-siapa so I found
then that kan so all the lagu semua lah ada lagu melayu semua all mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus uh baju semua awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
the whatever kan semua tak show up tak apa tapi caterer kalau tak show up wah
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that makanan apa kan ha orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa maggi mee
ya macam lah
ya I mean um he he dia very professional lah professional dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu and dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun for ah because the reason is that my mum is under religious punya school studies so kalau
so kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti my mum was like eh don't open like all these kind of song ah
ha so macam he understand like throughout truly lah everything semua dia faham semua so the was good
uh eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer datang we got our photoshoot photographs semua
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes kita punya video tak dapat balik so orang lain um tunjukkan video kat facebook after like what
two weeks kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
yes correct then the things that bila I that's when I found out that macam
um actually I don't really care lah that's it's correct lah macam sedih kita tak dapat video tapi at that same time I say
video could be just a story then tapi I nak cerita I dengan you like forever punya cerita video so I say okay
I want to get my own video tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat because my computer very slow
ya I know banyak tapi video um computer slow the things that all nak kena tunggu the computer baru datang baru boleh buat
ya the cuaca was nice because dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun so it was just that perfect moment
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding um because that wedding kan um I like my wedding betul but
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom punya wedding right is like terbaik ah pada I um shout to shah ibrahim he make it like macam it's like a hotel
tapi still macam tak hotel juga parking is the perfect place to park the car because apa ni kat mana eh
kan tanjong katong complex yes so that place was macam tanjong katong complex where dia punya
um what is called ya mm ya dia punya parking is open space it's there's lot of parking kalau tak ada parking pun you can still park at wisma you can still park at
hooga eh salah group punya side banyak tempat untuk you nak park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then dia punya makanan and then when I ask my friend because um I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there semua cakap makan and everything is just cost like less eh
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like macam that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like macam if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice lah cuma one thing about bad about that place it's not bad lah I say macam
not that fantastic about that place is just that dia punya tempat nak tukar baju and everything mm
ah yes because the things that macam okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as apa kita tahu kan mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali
ya around two to three right uh some ours was three ya ours was three eh no the sanding was two and then the nikah was one but nikah was a day before
so macam kita kita macam wah get married and then ah one thing about ya that one is just that ah
and then dapat hotel semua my friend actually uh because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process lah like macam because wedding malay weddings like kelam-kabut nak mampus leh bukan bukan uh macam jauh ah ah macam
bila you dah you nak tukar baju kan lepas tu you nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding
sekali macam you nak kena naik kereta go to the hotel just to tukar baju and then go back there so macam ah traffic and then campur you nak kena make up semua and then nak kena pakai baju semua so eventually that one ah take process up to two to three hours eh
the hours eh maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to alah dah cukup datang
tak lah tak juga pasal kalau nak buat photoshoot tak ada time mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi kan ha semua orang nak ambil gambar that time semua ha selit sikit
sikit ah sikit jer tapi that's the only macam if for orange ballroom ah but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary kita buat wedding lagi
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum punya dia akan suka okay about malay wedding eh
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or terpaksa like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one makcik when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like eh you got child ni you got child some more ah
walao I was like macam eh nak eh kelakar lah makcik ni
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually dia orang cuma ingat yang my mum cuma ada my brother and sister my kakak lah
cause my brother my kakak is the only people who are like macam
terserlah I me and my adik kita orang macam relax ah kita orang relax chill lepak bro tak buat apa-apa semua kita relax tak macam
my sister and my brother ha kita memang low profile relax ah relax like like you juga kan you pun relax tak buat apa-apa juga macam
ya lah tapi that time uh
we did say to uh my sister did say back because my sister was there I wasn't there kalau I was there macam over
so confirm I dah gaduh dengan dia lah tapi dah tak uh tapi K what if K takpe next question uh just asking you what is the luckiest or like macam you rasa macam
um thank god that time one one thing is the cuaca kan cuaca cuaca was like perfect ah okay then another thing apa yang you suka pasal that wedding
the other guy I mean my friend punya
I feel like macam that is the most the best thing ah of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about tak boleh makan or can makan also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know ah maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually ah menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi
mm tak ha dah kahwin pun ha tapi um
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do lah tapi macam
macam kalau tak then I I I I still okay so takpe okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin I dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana I dapat tahu macam mana you punya cara you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my makcik cakap auntie lisa lah she told me that
orang ketiga ke apa alhamdulillah I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no orang ketiga
it's almost six years already um we are not uh blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with uh being with you lah okay so um tapi kan I nak tanya you what was on your mind
okay uh bila you dah kahwin okay once you dah habis
all the nikah right and then um all the sanding semua dah habis kan and then outside then um kat dalam bilik dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur kan
but what was on your mind eh dalam otak you tu apa you fikir macam it was for me like I fikir macam eh aku dah kahwin lah seh
aku dah aku dah I'm like all these responsibilities macam fuh dah jatuh kat kat I lah then I rasa macam eh I dah kahwin eh like like really I dah kahwin eh I tak sangka I dah kahwin and then ah so I was like macam okay takpe lek even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there lepas tu macam oh wait wait wait kau dah kahwin
okay so that was like uh that but it wasn't a big thing yet ah ah but for you what what's on your mind bila
you bila all this dah habis kan and the sanding part semua dah habis what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya then like because the thing is that uh okay regarding about the call right dia macam mana tau
because the thing is that kalau you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home ke tak
ah not because um curang ke apa lah ha but it's more to like macam um like you pukul berapa nak balik I mean like worried tau worried uh you you also did because the thing is that
bila I dah jadi isteri
where are you tu semua and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like macam kalau malam alone not that good lah kan cause it's like macam
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good lah thank god we've got a good neighbourhood ah but no people like any tom dick or harry ke apa ke you call dia orang nak strike strike malam apa betul tak
ha so I tak suka lah kan
then um so another thing is like respect lah also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you ah bila eh you ni bila nak balik ni semua then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya tapi there's the I mean mostly you like about that lah ah but one thing about him like you tak kasih I you kasih I bebas
kebebasan also so I rasa macam happy lah ha so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind lah like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out lah yang kita ni ada banyak kesamaan in terms of like movies
ya and then like macam movie macam
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like macam harry potter you don't like tapi um lord of the ring you like and then
err so macam okay lah give and take ah stuff like that uh then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
jap at that time you belum apa at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
meticulous lah macam semua benda I mesti macam make sure that everything eh mesti macam
goes well lah uh because I punya orang tak macam itu tau I punya orang tak macam eh tak jadi pergi sini ah pasal ah due to this and that and this and that I rasa macam I rasa risau ha but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day eh kita macam eh on that time we actually had fun eh ha better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu macam tak plan apa and lepas tu kita terus like uh okay just dive ah
kita pergi cameron and port dickson
duit ada so I macam okay I terjun jer ah ha so it was macam it was fun lah it was fun kita pergi honeymoon tu semua and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then uh travel then
uh then he he can drive well ha naik atas semua and then because that one also is my first time I went out to um holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone ke pergi dengan kawan ke or pergi
dengan boyfriend apa tak pernah my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets semua kan orang lain dah siapkan dah
tapi kan ah but one thing is just like it's just fun lah tapi it's it's one thing like I feel like macam wah dah dah start into responsibility end up okay dah tahu macam mana nak book hotel tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis stop tak asyik book hotel jer nak pergi holiday jer
actually ada banyak juga for bandung but ada tapi kita tak tak venture ke sana lah
I regret tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin but then again I rasa this is still the right time because the thing is that
ah macam kita tak boleh buat macam uh and then um but then again after I dah berapa tahun yang I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people punya kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I rasa kan the time I I
I macam suka ikut-ikut orang ah macam oh dia ni ada bag dior I pun nak bag ah yang I nak pun nak I I pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat cafe ni semua but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding lah our wedding supposed to be like macam our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that dia orang suka um
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and hey you jangan cakap you pun tak ada flaws gitu eh ha tapi macam like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example kan macam kalau dulu you tahu kalau before kahwin kan uh kalau kalau tak kalau you kahwin you can play endless car ke apa kan freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but um
after marriage maybe you find like macam oh nak kena layan dia ni lah nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets ah
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding oh macam sekarang ha macam for me kan I tak regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but uh macam being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married ah ah but one thing about you you don't you don't let macam ah give me to kongkong you know macam like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that kan ha tapi you kasih I freedom of what to do like for example even this uh recording screen ke apa ke
some people will find it macam the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give ha so macam it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really macam into it lah
ha cakap nanti berselerak lah apa lah
ya kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah lah kan so so eventually macam not all guys can actually accept this ah so actually one thing I I happy lah I dapat kahwin dengan you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it macam funny ah because that time I wasn't planning mah to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking eh this guy okay or not ha
I I tak boleh seh kalau you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
ha if you do have another girl outside or what then um that was one of my biggest fear lah I have I don't have like small small fear but then macam that one I think that if that happen terus cut ah
ah and also pukul lah but then I there wasn't any hit or anything ah I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything lah uh so um okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
uh like for example anything ah that you think like ada ke apa biggest fear lah
some in-laws lah kalau there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me macam I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum ke apa and then your mum don't like me akan cakap eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni sia eh sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni ha dah lah gemuk tak lawa tu semua but then it's like
not like that ah your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually um uh apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua so we were like
featuring guest lah kalau you nak uh
six years and then macam kalau you want to have another what what what is your no request lah what is your future plans for the next four years before we step into that ten year punya anniversary ya
ha to join us apa semua tu so I wish that kita our financial also is doing good and everything and then um healthier family and also um slimmer but until now also dah five years also still not slim so
ya lah takde lah just just saying only
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
a maritime in logistics I think there they have actually two course so they have a maritime law and actually and maritime logistic so I'm think I'm having interest in the logistics so macam and I feel that lagi senang ah
ya but it's a more of a countryside punya tempat mm so okay lah there's no distractions I think
actually is a really a good job because like dekat that time intern tempat intern aku bourbon
kau tahu tak admin earn berapa
ya no because I think you see industry mana lah like I feel like kalau kau should search in
maritime punya admin cause they don't go they don't go on board
they just duduk office and just um
friend is admin dekat maritime that time dekat bourbon so she earn two point five but then after after the is ready is one point nine ya correct
under law punya admin
two points seven cause she got a lot of experience no no need you just admin macam registration orang nak masuk
those work that people don't want to do macam filing and stuff
pasal sia
I have still have time to march ah to think about it to I mean to go bank also to minta loan study loon and stuff
like a news so macam like my previous intern might cause I'm still keeping contact them one of the managers kena buang sia
retrenched macam because the economy was busted sia
but ya because aku like from a project I've been working with him so he's the one who actually ya guide me but now they retrench him macam wah

dia macam the oriental express um
what was it eh situ apa ah sebelum the knives out okay jap before that I just wanted to say about the knives out lah okay
it's kinda okay even though err aku tidur lepas tu but I can somehow see that it's a good movie because it actually sedikit banyak macam the oriental express
it's about uh a person being murdered orang kena bunuh and then macam there's a lot but whereas in the oriental express there were twelve people were being suspect and twelve of them were all the murderers that's why the other that's why it was being stabbed twelve times lah kan
but then in this case dalam the oriental err apa the knives out err dia pasal about err dia punya apa this guy umur dia lapan puluh lima tahun eh dia baru sambut dia punya birthday yang lapan puluh lima tahun lepas tu lah dia kena um dia orang assume dia kena bunuh lah
so after that aku tak tahu apa jadi
but you told me that there was satu orang there's a one suspect right ada satu orang kena suspect so ya
this kind of err story apa err story that story line is is good lah I like ah kind of like ya I'm gonna watch it again later
semalam penat babe
um before that what did we watch eh sebelum tu apa kita tengok
you can't have more than one spell ya because aku rasa because one of them err jatuh hati dengan um dia punya apa classmate dia ya
kawan sekolah dia so dia actually dah buat because there's a bully eh actually this guy is a bully so
ya what they did was um dia orang semua spell a cast on him to turn him into good guy and eventually he did lah tapi sayang ya lepas tu yang the one that fall in love with him actually had another err spell cast on him so lepas tu tahu tahu besok dia dah mati
not so super natural sangat juga it still err ya it's true lah
mm tadi apa lagi kita tengok kita tengok oh the nun we watched the nun
aku rasa cerita conjuring is the best horror movie lah
it's it's kind of err thrilling for me memang ah aku pun penakut tapi
lagi pun tengah COVID kan so macam apa lagi cerita kau pergi tengok

and then when and then when it came to a part whereby she started to horn and then you said that okay this is where you will begin okay then I'm like okay I thought he's gonna be like macam stalk her all the way just focusing on her but no she he actually went way beyond and
apa err attacking the family members and all the stuff
wah that's tu seram eh tu kalau kat singapore aku rasa just err
orang tumbuk-menumbuk punya eh
daripada kena road rage
so lepas tu it falls on a saturday and then his wife was supposed to follow him but then the wife actually got invite invitation to err the wife actually is a bake caterer lah
um she was invited to do catering for her event and she's an artist photographer lah begitu so she owns that a big err art gallery eh so lepas tu
err bila dia kata I ah can't follow he she can't follow him to the reunion for this saturday
and then lepas tu uh the guy actually got um connected back with dia punya ex-girlfriend ex-girlfriend back in the college and then the ex-girlfriend also texted him saying that um my husband is not coming then
err I think this guy tak nak ada any connection ah so he just you know
okay I just say this guy A lah eh I forgot the name so this guy A dah pergi dekat reunion dia so he saw his ex-girlfriend
and then it came to a point where the girl the ex-girlfriend actually keep on macam harassing him in a way like kasi uh gambar yang dia tengah pakai sexy lah yang dia tengah apa err ah seducing in a way so two months later
err what what was there sekali dia nampak apa gambar-gambar dia macam nampak gambar familiar kat gallery dia gambar-gambar dia is
all the pictures of him having sex with the ex tapi gambar tak tunjuk
so the picture dia punya face wasn't shown lah so he suspects suspected dia like that maybe this his girlfriend of his is err you know revenging him back tapi tak tahu pasal apa
sampai masanya the woman at the err wife get to know that you know um
so lepas tu dah habis he err the wife somehow got kidnapped

so err aku takut ah aku tak marah lah kalau aku marah dia sekali dia bawa the gang ah mana tahu dia faham bahasa aku so
so bila so that time bila aku tengah jalan-jalan then there's this one ang moh ada this orang putih mat salleh lah dia
I think she was trying to play with the monkey but the rangers suruh kita dah kita masuk kita semua orang masuk dia dah cakap don't try to be funny lah kalau ada
uh grab your banana grab banana lah kalau dia um you know you don't like macam main-main dengan dia lah so aku rasa this orang putih main-main dengan dia so he actually wanted to bite her ears
aku rasa dia angry ah or aggressive ah because dia main-main the rangers tu dah kata jangan main-main so so he actually wanted to bite the ears ah so dah macam just
not really that deep bite lah sort of one bite so the ah the caucasian girl was at shock ah dia pekik and in the ranger was like I think they had this macam
kayu ke apa aku tak tahu ah I don't know what's that lah so he just like macam whack it so that the monkey will go away
aku tak tahu ah that is that is because they are rangers they know their monkeys aiyo
ah tahu tak apa ah nanti dia panggil dia punya gang lagi ah tak payah lah terima kasih sudah
aku rather deal with one monkey than a lot of monkeys
okay maybe ostrich farm is one another one is yang dekat mana eh
I mean they they don't really macam
they don't really macam
um ya malaysia ostrich aku rasa I felt regretful that we didn't get to feed the kangaroo when we were in australia
I have holidays in november and december right so you know I always have this macam
so aku just want to ask like do you prefer to work at home or do you prefer to go to your physical workplace
so ya that's that's that's our life lah eh kita hopefully things get better hopefully things um
okay lah I don't like that you know we take things we take life for granted we thought that you know you could travel as much as we can we could go out as much as we can you know but when this kind of thing happen we will like macam
alamak tak boleh buat tu tak boleh buat ni
we can't get to travel as much we can't um and then when we now we used to have like gathering kita ada gathering we used to like just book chalet and invite you know like what twenty thirty forty people and then birthday celebration
we will invite people over but now is like macam
orang lagi banyak yang hush hush you know coming in to celebrate birthday and all those stuff
aku rasa vendor pun kesian juga lah it's like you know all these err thing macam numbers restricted numbers and all those stuff that is coming from the government right so when pengantin dah buat bayaran for certain for certain pax eh
and then the pengantin okay lah kalau aku pun aku pun rasa macam I just wasted my money you know like few thousand dollars and then now the numbers is like that so and then vendors pun
kesian juga lah like macam aku dia also want to earn a living you see so there was a point whereby there's err apa err miscommunication between the pengantin and vendor like asking for refund and all those stuff like even vendor also didn't know that this thing will happen
and it wasn't even in the contract so some of them that I heard is like blaming the vendor you know of not giving me back tak highlight dengan duit lah you know and those stuff but
aku rasa it's it has it has to be um
communicate both face sekali lah
like pengantin pun tak expect numbers will drop vendor pun tak expect numbers will drop so you know it's only fair that vendor err apa err maybe gantikan dengan something or the pengantin kurangkan something so that you know both will be happy about it lah
ya pasar basah ya
mengeteh lah kopi lah so

I think I eat like what dinner pukul lapan I didn't eat breakfast my breakfast is coffee
then after that aku lupa nak makan
eh jemput minum so my breakfast is just coffee so laki aku cakap you have to look after your health is not that I do not want to look after my health is really tak ada masa ya
dorangnya buku sekolah lah lah buku madrasah lah apa benda nak kena beli
dah sec four hairi ah secondary ah
that's the first choice ya second choice is bukit panjang actually dia punya
dia punya aggregate is ah
in between err normal academic and express he can go to express but if you want to go to an express class he have to go to the the sekolah yang
yang tak best sikit lah
like teck whye secondary which we don't kita tak nak that's the only school that is nearby us that we never choose
laki aku tak suka lah dia punya um
ah ya so the neighbourhood dia tak suka jadi dia cakap cannot other school boleh dapat normal academic pun takpe tapi tak boleh
any school lah any school that we choose tu boleh
pasal sekolah eh tak pasal kau punya kerja eh actually dia dah macam dah branch out dah

asam orh kunyit ah but tapi kunyit hidup ah jangan pakai kunyit powder
kunyit hidup aku baru buat aku aku aku blend ah ah I blend kunyit
and then I put in one one container then I blend ginger put in one container so anytime you want to drink like err ginger lemon ke apa kan mm then you just take lah
letak air panas letak lemon letak honey habis cerita
to me deep station err dia punya tu terlalu
ya because dia letak garlic juga apa right
the lemon grass no dia dia macam blend benda untuk masak kau faham ah tu yang pada aku macam tak tak best
aku ya I always mix with water then I just drink it as a shot
that one is for what buat bangun pagi jadi perut kempis
you see ah that is the old people thinking you know if you watch if you watch the err those yang health punya shows kan the health shows yang melayu punya tau
terus cakap eh this one is all
it doesn't matter minum air sejuk ke tidak it does not affect your system
so macam aku aku kan ada yang that package that time err urut kat tempat err tempat cina punya
urut ah then dia urut-urut aku dia cakap oh you shouldn't be drinking too much err cold water your inside ah sorry china kan china women so dia cakap your inside is very wet aku dah ketawa of course lah my inside very wet kan darah kalau dry I die already your inside is very wet
aku tak faham apa maksud dia very wet
but then dia nak cakap aku punya tu sejuk ke apa system aku sejuk ke aku pun tak tahu I think it ya lah I think is a problem ah because aku kadang-kadang macam minum air sejuk banyak sangat kan kaki aku sakit seh
well haus nyah
aku tengah menyusu haus tau
serious lah kalau dah artiste mesti lah better
ya you add in that one lah like those floral floral things you know like the chrysanthemum ke bunga rose ke the dried rose ah they say is good for complexion

tu ah kan cakap mak-mak ni berbual ada jer daripada satu topic branch out
kalau betul dapat is fifty dollars fifty
okay lah buat
macam laki aku buat ah that time aku tak tahu eh so one of the years birthday aku dia kasi aku ni

aku tak tahu pasal that time kita baru masing-masing masih kerja like still very new kind
experiment kena kasi darah
ah tapi dia kasi darah I think a lot ah then have to come like couple of times ah so

lama anak aku masih kecil lagi dua-dua aku masih belum ada hasif masih tak ada
eh dia takut jarum ah aku tu yang aku hairan
for all my pregnancies the man have to come to to take their blood or whatever right dia takut gila jarum kecil macam gitu pun dia takut huh the err they check blood right
mother and father punya blood or something ya ya ya hmm
even like at work if he has to do the um flu jabs right he always decline then I say why it's err it's compulsory he's like no it's it's not it's not compulsory so that's why I always reject uh huh anyway dia cakap anyway dia berbual dengan dia punya nurse um the nurse told me not all flu jabs are
what's that word no no no not murah it's free what they they already have to take it not all flu jabs are effective
because the certain flu jabs are for certain types of flu string so sometimes you can you can take the flu jab already and then the next few months you have flu which but it is cause by different string ah dia tak effective jadi dia cakap if not effective what for I take don't need to take ah
siao because to me to me pada aku you should take it because you are facing all these people all the prisoners all the visitors coming in and out test ya took twice
actually nowadays dulu aku aku dulu macam aku gung-ho ah tak takut tapi lepas tu ah
sensitive makin takut
kalah bising ah
sekarang dia dah start jalan kan jadi rumah aku berselerak ah
ye lah
I don't mind berselerak sometimes but
diri kau sendiri lah
I know lah it's good but you see ah I'm I'm dealing with different cases already macam kau aku rasa ian is very well behaved
I have all the phases that's the problem that's why I aku macam stressed because I have one boy I have one eh actually ah this conversation do we need to speak singlish or not
no need eh nevermind ah
asalkan ada dua-dua lah mixed
hairi dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay I have aira who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
hopefully soon belum seh she ask she ask me you know ibu when am I going to get my period five already primary six
dey kau sec one eh sec two ke sec one I know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes lah aku primary three
dia dia dia aku punya marker dia kalau dah start dah start kan chocolate lah ah that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya I think so dia aku punya marker every month
nanti kadang-kadang dia mood swing aku tak mood swing aku okay jer lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku are you going to get your period ah tapi after that I'll get it lah he's my marker first then after that I will get it nanti dia okay kelakar kan ya but but after that will be ah ye sejiwa lah sangat ya I think we sync already
ya so I have aira then I have hasif who is coming into primary school level and he talks so much and because he has the influences from dia punya brother and sister jadi dia punya perbualan tak macam budak primary school punya perbualan macam elly masih boleh berbual cute cute
cute lah masih cute lah juga hasif tak tau dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because I'm naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
abang why you never wait for me abang can you quickly do this kalau kalau aku ada macam abang you never clear the litter bukan aku yang suruh tau dia yang suruh
in a way lah tapi nanti abang dia complain nanti macam kadang-kadang laki aku cakap tanya aku whether I'm okay or not aku I have to tell him the truth ah I'm not okay
there's once I actually complain to him kalau aku punya kerja eh senang tau kau bangun pagi kau cium anak happy semua anak-anak tengah happy apa tanya okay okay I see you later ah then after that bila kau balik you attend your stuff already outside you go to the gym you come home it's dinner time the kids happy then it's already bedtime so you so so your time with them is like just it's only like one two hours ah it's bed time already finish then it's my time with you ah but in the middle
you you don't need to settle their breakfast you don't have to settle their lunch you don't have to settle their dinner ah then you don't see ya me instructing them eh pergi mandi lah sekarang dari pukul berapa kena solat kena ni kena gitu ni semua tolong ibu oh my god
alah camera tu camera tu for show jer bukannya pakai pun bila aku tinggalkan budak-budak sorang-sorang kat rumah
then aku penat tau aku cakap dengan dia kau balik kau nampak semua dah settle tau
except for sometimes berselerak which I will I will always like okay okay clean up clean up
pasal aku tak nak dia stressed ah kononnya macam dah dah tempat kerja is so difficult already then you come home and then you see more mess and you get fed up you know
anything ah so like because I have cats right jadi I have no choice in the morning first thing in the morning I have to do is vacuum then after that I mop
by the time tak payah tak payah tunggu satu tak sampai tunggu tiga jam lah satu dua jam jer kau nampak bulu semua bergerak
I have to do it jadi aku vacuum again
but I can't because I have a I have a err a crawling toddler you know abeh aku tak suka jadi aku kena if I shave them ah
tak lah cepat lah nanti grow balik ah ah
kena shave again aku shave sendiri lah mana ada kena bayar apa benda
shave sembarang
ah initially kita shave sembarang a'ah petak-petak lah gasak ah then after that macam initially macam kita nak eh let's let's try to to maintain dorang punya fur so we use the the the head whatever lah then in the end ah tak kuasa lah go down to zero shave aje semua terus nampak macam ah nampak macam biasa balik
aku punya ni banyak message ah macam banyak sangat itu ah messages coming to my phone
help apa
condition rumah aku
takde there's no way lah I the only way is for me to lazy parenting lah the robot I have I have it no it works the thing is aku
we were observing the robot tau kita cakap kesian robot ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena manoeuvre macam kalau aku jadi robot kan aku macam like alamak meja alamak ada child punya benda alamak mainan no and and that's how dia macam macam confused ah so the best the best thing ah when I was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy I do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
kita beli second hand aku punya benda takde lah first hand semua second hand
I called it lazy parenting lah I just order them about macam ayra sekarang dia dah pandai
belakang a'ah lah
kelabu asap ya granite
actually rumah aku dah dah takde is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all dah no ah the island I push there already because I don't I don't bake any more mah ya ya pasal aku dah tak bake jadi aku letak jer lah tolak ke tepi dulu so I have space to move around in the kitchen
then how yang tu kau tak pergi yang block two one eight tu why jauh daripada apa
I think so ya because sometimes err aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat kranji juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
rumah jannah
aku nampak rumah orang jer view apa
cause macam those rumah-rumah yang baru kan the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best that's why resale punya prices is still
pasal that time aku tanya ah naz rumah aku punya two years two years ya
ya means kalau dah naik market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
jauh ah aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus tau cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada dengan yes correct then yang kat hujung-hujung is ada tapi mahal
ya this location quite difficult that time ada yang block opposite opposite my house block two zero four dia jual dia punya
then dia jual murah because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it lah since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later gila nasib baik ya I was thinking of that ah
ya I was thinking you know like eh this is the best time you know yang let's just do it lah nanti kita boleh fikir cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my what
not not not tapping into his so okay apa
dia bayar dia punya part is lapan ratus aku punya part lima ratus
hmm but kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena increase but then again you'll be difficult lah cause if I prolong like this no job no contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser bila aku nak itu
chey sudah lah
kejap jer then lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak
tak aku aku nak need bigger space but then aku pun fikir bigger space means we probably buy more things
just be happy jer lah dengan apa dengan space yang aku ada because most of the time pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik
three is just enough in in in apa in the end pun kita plan at this moment ah because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
aira yang tu yang tak she volunteered she say nevermind hafis sleep with me
hmm because dia sorang jer apa yang she gets everything what her own her own like double girls lah ah but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far hmm that's why she don't mind that hafis sleep with her
they are all sleeping together still tilam tilam kau tu very useful bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal
so she sleep on her own tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam
ya in a way lah so gasak korang lor
tu dah start nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne
jap eh aku punya sini tak tak tak tak tak mute ke
kita berbual habis tu aku tak mute aku punya itu
ah takde pun
la ilaha illallah tak tahu lah
apa-apa ah
satu setengah ah mm mm
ya exactly cuma masalahnya is the noise from the background aje hopefully it doesn't affect so much lah exactly habis-tu pula telefon aku aku tak tahu
but that's the thing you see our aku tengah pasal bila first time aku nampak this thing kan aku macam like
tadi kita tadi kita dah macam cakap kan pasal ni aku cakap aku nak berbual dengan laki aku tapi laki aku cakap ya I don't speak malay which is true lah he no oh my god tak aku jer mixed mixed aku sorang jer yang boleh berbual dengan korang melayu fasih no problem takde masalah langsung kalau nak kasi aku apa kalau kau nak aku berbual apa tu chey berbual melayu yang yang no lah I mean like using proper malay words also I think I can try
a'ah tu lah aku pun rasa macam gitu eh cakap pasal banyak english banyak melayu kelmarin aku kena interview that was on wednesday no on tuesday
so mendaki nak interview aku so mendaki cakap dengan aku eh hasif ni kan in every of his class pasal hasif kan ambil yang mendaki nya classes which is free right ah in every of his class dia actually very outspoken pandai berbual ah you hantar dia untuk itu eh untuk preschool tak cakap ya dia pernah start daripada preschool lah start daripada play group dia cakap eh how about your other children aku cakap oh ya my eldest tu memang ah daripada nursery ah all the way sampai kindergarten oh kita tengah cari families lah yang hantar anak-anak gi ah preschool kita nak interview you boleh tak
okay jer aku aku sembarang gasak lah tak lah dia nak kasi aku voucher tak kesah lah aku tak kesah if it if it helps the community apa salahnya then dia cakap ya so kebetulan kau ingat tak yang there's one day yang aku hantar korang satu article a lot of malay families tak hantar so it's on conjunction with that kiranya dorang nak interview aku tu kan
to create awareness that how macam mana ah sekolah ah for preschool kan for preschoolers it's good to send kids err to preschool to
you know permulaan from all the different cases lah
ya ramai a lot so bila aku berbual dengan so yang datang tu is a mendaki person and then there's this person I do not know I think she is err from
yang err
maybe from the preschool punya aku tak tahu lah okay lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang interview aku tu it's from berita harian so aku tanya actually kenapa you nak interview I pasal the preschoolers ah cause is it because of this article that I read err budak-budak ah apa bangsa melayu tak itu
aku cakap ah ah tak dorang tak hantar then I say kenapa err what's the reason you tahu tak apa dia punya reason dia cakap dorang cakap is not necessary
jadi dorang hantar K one K two jer huh
aku cakap lah eh itu zaman mak bapa kita seh zaman mak bapa kita ye lah kita hantar K one K two jer ah tapi sekarang I think
the system dah berubah
if you send to the government punya the punya dorang memang tak ada childcare service apa it's only a few hours everyday lain lah kalau dorang ambil ambil yang macam ah macam aku punya is private so they have a childcare service from seven to seven
so pada aku macam like apa seh pada aku like why would you say it is not necessary pada that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan you bila you ah decided to hantar lah anak you pergi preschool
that's where then then I ask lah this interview going to be in malay or english eh abeh dia cakap in malay lah aku cakap my malay is also tak strong sangat mm kita mixed mixed boleh cakap ah boleh ah so kita berbual
the dia punya question was very legit ah like macam okay first kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi preschool secondly ah bagaimana ah bagaimana ah
mm ah apabila menghantar mereka tu kan ah did it help
did it help in what dorang punya perkembangan ah dalam pelajaran
ah development self development tu aku cakap lah pasal dorang punya motor skills dorang punya cognitive behaviour dorang punya social skill and then benda-benda yang yang preschool boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar like saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang math ke
more sight words ke phonics ke it's very difficult for me to read I don't have the takde macam dia punya layout on how to teach them
tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah kan semua dah ada
err a program for them ah senang sikit
so dorang tanya like um
then dia cakap like macam how do you feel lah bila hantar like is there any improvement aku cakap ya ada banyak lah improvement terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang very err friendly
you know he's very active dia pandai pandai berbual public speaking pun dia tak takut
which is true tak takut seh ah dia macam like ah gasak ah sembarang ah you know
so but aku macam like feel very abeh dia tanya aku lah like err is it do you think that it's because of finances
then aku cakap terus terang ni memang berat because saya ni sekarang tak bekerja jadi ah finances okay lah berat juga untuk anak-anak tapi this is for anak-anak education there has to be a way mesti ada jalan lain kalau nak cakap pasal private tak boleh
we go to a government based ah government aided sekolah and then kalau kita low income mesti the sekolah has a system for the lower income family jadi dapat further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about kalau tak nak berbual pasal finances there could another reason the other reason kenapa ah mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi preschool kerana tak ada tempat ah tak ada tempat mm in the neighbourhood tak cukup preschool ya so so I cakap okay terus terang ah untuk hafif I masuk kan nak masuk kan dia infant care
I registered him for infant care bila I masih dalam perut this is where orang semua cakap eh kiasu nya dulu pun I pun macam gitu aku cakap gitu dulu pun aku macam gitu apasal eh orang apa pregnant masih dalam perut dah dah registered now after that I dah kena I tahu kenapa kerana tak ada tempat so people have to be like
think ahead cause a lot of families right now I told her lah a lot of families right now dorang prefer hantar anak from what I know I notice prefer hantar anak pergi preschool pergi childcare daripada ada maid kat rumah because kalau kat childcare budak-budak belajar can develop you know at home ah
susah kan
take care only tapi ah
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
don't try so hard lah cukup lah
terus aku macam like lepas tu aku fikir-fikir balik aku macam like eh kesiannya kalau kita punya malay community really do not want to
oh okay okay okay aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni mystery shopper that was many years back lah then after that uh the I only did once
because uh lepas tu like there's no job and nobody call me lah I did the ah aku pernah buat yang apa yang shopping tu eh
I did the one for uh one of the retailers in singapore lah but I have to go it's a it's a one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet tau lepas tu kan
one of the important one is the customer service ah because they are rating customer service punya survey
so you actually depends ah macam when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things err they are looking out for
and then err ya but for me is I just concentrate one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet lah
tapi uh after that they never call me oh for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar tapi dia punya product is
then uh she's given one product so it actually varies macam kau buat uh mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like err basic necessity macam for your home
but uh my friend one is quite interesting dia pergi dia buat pasal uh food product ah I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think macam like uh macam maggi then with a a particular brand specific brand
lepas tu nanti uh dia kena pergi uh two or three no three or four different err supermarket
so it depends ah macam mana kau punya what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
tak lah sia upfront
so it's your own free time bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
ya it's quite fast cuma uh they will give you a deadline lah by this date kau kena submit back come back to the office and submit ah
lama seh but I think that time was not hundred ah less than that
mm assignment tapi the assignment uh dia kasih macam uh tiga
the one the ya then the questions is all similar lah cuma three different outlet kau kena pergi then macam outlet A outlet B outlet C lepas tu the questions are the same ah
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that macam berselerak ke ataupun very neat always very neat
uh eh this date this or this week right got this date this time uh apa ni surveyor coming
so it's like uh consistency lah cuma the
tapi like the working hours how
cuma it's like quite far lah I mean uh I think I feel like it's quite far tapi three times a week okay what ah
ya lah but I heard that the pay is quite good you know uh apa ni I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like macam dormitories eh the they can even pay up to macam I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend uh and my friend was saying lah macam gini like uh she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
tapi uh do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
ya lah rumah dia berapa bilik seh
mm it's so far it's still okay lah we don't have any pay cut tapi macam
macam uh like how long can we tahan like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical lah
so like uh and then plus being in the fintech kan macam don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
then uh like other products macam very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
ya lah I mean rumours have been going around lah it's better to look for something else but again in this situation macam mana nak cari seh
abeh kalau macam right now like right now I'm still okay lah I still have a job what but then
so I was like eh when I look at linkedin I was like eh ada eh orang masih nak masih nak cari ni ah
dia jaga macam uh one of the creative uh asia pacific punya director eh APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas pergi overseas punya office kan
lepas tu uh her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
basically aku tengok macam
I was like oh my gosh macam some people are just so lucky
lepas tu macam new joiner new secretary join kan lepas tu dia tak nak uh macam she she will be the mentor lah because she senior what
and then uh selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak jer lah like like just ask people to do ah ask people to do the powerpoint
uh ask people to change the apa send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay sekali it in the end bila dia punya boss tu dah tua ah
sekali just before I left uh boss dia kena macam apa macam apa tu
bukan retrench apa tu macam uh dah dah tua kan jadi uh kena
so uh they we speculated ah dia dia kata golden handshake so the boss leave right

aku dah macam eh sia ah die die sia mana aku nak carikan dia ni hotel and he is very specific luckily bukan boss ah dia macam manager level there

I don't want to fly macam certain timing apa dia sekarang aku nak kena book under the new flight apa dia mati-mati nak leave uh that night ataupun the next day morning eh
because he got meeting or whatsoever lah so he need to leave like there as soon as possible kecoh sia
ya then I was like ah okay okay let's divide and conquer you find hotel I go and find flight then he was like okay okay okay aku
tu lah masalahnya because they always keep on changing tau and then aku rasa uh yang yang lain tu aku dah book siang-siang tapi si lelaki ni
dia kasih dia bilang aku last minute dia nak flight ni nak flight tu the these are the flights he want this is ni ah
kira dia bilang aku last minute aku book kan dia separately last minute ah aku bukan book kan dia orang tiga-tiga at the same time
lepas tu aku tengok eh aku dah kecoh sia cari hotel
lepas tu aku cari flight ah lepas tu lepas tu dia call aku dia cakap did you manage to get the flight aku cakap uh not yet
abeh aku kasih dia options kan lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku ya I also can't get a hotel
uh it's too last minute and no hotels around here ah ya it's all fully book aku dah macam alamak
in the end we got lah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia like uh aku tak boleh dapat flight yang kau betul-betul nak at this exact timing yang kau nak depart this is the only best option eh
habis tu dia cakap uh apa apa apa lepas tu dia kata ah okay then uh he he we sorted out the flights ah
hotel pula then uh last minute he say he just went back to the hotel that he just check out kesian kau I feel so bad I was like
apa dia dia kata uh I just took I'm going to take a taxi now to go back to the hotel and see they have one last room
abeh aku cakap ah okay okay okay uh you take the cab and then I know lah the journey about thirty minutes eh
lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia you go and take the cab now I will call the hotel
lepas tu pergi ah
lepas tu dah dah finish after the whole episode right dia dah balik hotel dia dah dapat tau the last room and I think it's the smallest room he's and he's very particular about hotel room also
so dia cari dah lah last minute tak ada hotel tapi nak cari hotel yang according to his category
aku dah macam ambil jer lah hotel apa yang ada it's just for one more night the next day afternoon that time he's flying off already what
lepas tu dia cakap uh yang dia patah balik hotel tu sekali kita berbual-berbual uh abeh aku cakap dengan hotel tu ah boleh ah macam any room can ah because
it's just for one night ah lagipun dia selalu regular kat hotel kau
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay and then in the end they found one small studio room for him ah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
dia kata no it's okay lepas tu uh sabo sia lepas tu dia dapat dia tak dapat flight yang pagi kan pasal the next day petang dia ada meeting tau
lepas tu pagi dia tak dapat flight yang dia nak kena balik kan aku dapatkan dia petang ke malam I think
lepas tu uh bila dia dia bilang dengan boss aku kira he's under my boss what dia bilang dengan boss aku uh
lepas tu aku cakap eh sabo sia dia ni tapi boss aku tak marah boss aku ketawa jer dia cakap are you just trying to skive and not come for the meeting
dia cakap no she book me the wrong flight aku dah macam oh crazy
kan lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia lah eh then you also should check you know aku tapi aku macam okay lah let's not be let's not fight over this aku cakap dengan dia we are both at fault I booked wrongly and you didn't check
mampus kan actually initially he was like that tapi aku cakap dengan dia there's really no other flights
uh budget flight pun tak ada unless you want to reel up and go via mana entah aku cakap dengan dia macam a very long route eh in the end you reach singapore also like the same
and lepas tu macam but after that he was like okay lah tapi he took that opportunity to shoot me back ah in front of my boss dia cakap ah ya she book me on the wrong date
flight back aku dah macam tapi yang ni pun sepatutnya aku kena declare dengan finance the ya the right
aku cakap eh uh eh this is what happen dia kata in case if uh anybody question then you can just look for me ah but if nobody question just let it go
buy new ticket ah lepas tu pun dah cock-up lagi then the the makcik kaypoh the senior told me like it's okay you just have to declare again aku cakap
declare lagi hari tu dah declare cakap sorry then declare lagi mampus
tu ah
lepas tu aku cakap ah takpe lepas tu but then the finance I think the finance explained to the lah
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay lah dah
uh aku rasa something more expensive tu pasal in the end he earn what right because he get to fly on the more expensive flight and don't have to go for meeting
uh entah
one way ticket totally different airline kiranya vietnam tu forfeit ah pasal dia tak nak travel on that timing yang kat vietnam yang aku dah book tu the next day punya kan
aku cakap pergi jer lah balik jer lah besoknya dah terang-terang dah ada vietnam flight tu
vietnam apa ho chi minh
tak tapi hari tu semua dah fully booked tak ada tak ada flight
budget airline yang kita check lepas tu ada like go uh transit via whatever very far away right
irritating kan with the transit punya tu
ya lah that's why I was like like lepas tu dia pula macam he's very particular hotel leh
then flight okay dia macam apa-apa macam economy apa-apa lah dia cuma but tapi hotel must be really
tu aku cakap mampus sia that day terus sekarang aku cakap uh we let's we both learned a lesson every time I send you you check okay
dia kata but uh it's not funny aku kata it's not funny when your
kan kelakar kan tapi lepas tu bila dia balik singapore I think the next he say hey let me uh hidayah let me buy you coffee we should go for a good coffee
dia cakap ya let's just go to the one across the road no need to get so expensive
lepas tu dia macam aku cakap dengan dia so next time moving forward aku book kau please check because aku cakap dengan dia at that point of time kau tahu tak date yang aku book tu bila
aku book on friday I think five plus in the evening eh nak dekat pukul enam tau
last minute everybody like confirm confirm confirm nak ni nak tu lepas tu kita aku duduk kat office tu dengan kawan aku kat depan ni
we went through like so many booking and then takut macam duplicate booking kan macam aku dah book the book kan
lepas tu some of the people right in the kira total about eleven twelve people all travelling at one time
but all like different departure date ah different timing different flight terus aku split dengan kawan aku ni aku cakap okay kau buat dia ni punya flight aku buat dia punya flight okay
lepas tu macam overlap lepas tu uh bilik pula kau buat ah okay kau buat this hotel room aku buat ni ni ni punya okay
lepas tu macam it's so messy I was like oh my gosh
takkan aku nak buat on weekend seh so I have to do it over what I was like

pasal itu hari pasal apa eh that we we divide like that because I think some is his people some is my people lepas tu
lepas tu uh those who is travelling on saturday there is some from my list that is also travelling on saturday so aku pass kat dia
lepas tu dia anyway ya lah
lepas tu ah it's it's like that lah so it becomes like I don't just take care of my team you know macam my team got ten people right she got two for example right
then I got like maybe three people that's also travelling on the same date as her one of the people that she's in her team so macam kita passing passing eh
lepas tu hotel pula lagi satu kan kita kena book direct we don't have travel agent what
ah aku punya team luckily that guy is like like like like very good I mean he's okay with me lah
he's irritatingly macam uh macam action he's from india
tapi actually he's he's a very straightforward person and he he mean no harm lah it's just business nothing personal eh
lepas tu yang si hotel lagi satu hal
kita book direct kita takde ni kan travel agent kita book direct kan lepas tu kita pergi lah booking dot com hotels dot com apa apa yang murah-murah tu kan
lepas tu hotel the the same hotel dah full
abeh uh apa ni aku cakap dengan kawan aku tu eh then how dia ni dah full

lepas like and then another day is like uh kita tu hari buat video farewell kan
lepas tu kita go around macam uh like everybody just have to wave to the camera ah
lepas tu kawan aku tengah pegang camera tengah jalan around the office kan sekali yang si boss yang aquarius ni
kau tahu dia bukan wave tau dia tunjuk middle finger lah sia
terus kita semua macam terperanjat because he really look like a nerdy good boy macam
you ask him to do anything dia akan buat punya ah macam very like listen like very obedient small boy like that ah
sekali kawan aku tengah jalan take the camera shot in the office kan sekali pergi kat tempat dia he's supposed to wave
suddenly he uh he pull out the middle finger then we were like oh my god did what happen to the good boy like kena sampuk apa sia dia ni

aku cakap muka dia macam decent kalau dia berbual lagi macam tak pernah pekik tau his voice is always so soft spoken eh
macam very the nice nice boy like that ah
sekali when he show the middle finger I was like oh my gosh all men are the same
ah dia kira aku punya boss ah dia dia
uh marketing side chief marketing officer kelakar
but I was like muka baik macam budak-budak baik sekali padahal sama juga
tak lah singapore ah
bro you can't even masuk malaysia
buka the border
but when did it even tutup the borders is it recent no eh
but I also scared to masuk malaysia now though like now malaysia tiba-tiba banyak gila case
ya bro like in a day dorang ada macam three hundred cases tau
but it's like macam at area but still like like it's COVID man it's like the virus dia boleh spread cepat-cepat pe no matter where you are
I know like a a week ago or two weeks ago it was like oh uh one case dekat like uh what macam punya yang macam apa sunway lagoon I don't know then tiba-tiba two case seh tiba-tiba like twenty lah blah blah then tiba-tiba in a day like one hundred or two hundred I don't know something like that
basically like spike up like the cases spike up in a day banyak gila
for real so I'm kinda okay that kita tak boleh masuk but the thing is for the past few months it was close like macam asal kita tak boleh masuk tapi ni dia dah spike up balik so I don't know
dorang dah start balik apa dorang punya I don't know like dorang dah start they have to start like staying at home again
I mean I was I was stalking like malaysian punya celebrity then dorang macam yay lagi then I'm like oh really for real that was like four days ago two days ago ada orang post gambar I don't know
I know crazy right bro I literally just only thought like it was a getting better then like tiba-tiba spike up balik
first like okay like alhamdulilah ah like I finger crossed it won't happen to singapore like even though yang korea dapat apa the second wave tapi it's not as much as malaysia tau
ya but it like the cases are not like super macam uh as macam extra like macam banyak gila
ya mana ada time nak
nak stalk syafiq kyle
even though I tak suka pun I akan tengok seh super bored
no I just know that eh I only watch if I know the pelakon or if I like dia berlakon
did you even know there's like dramas like halted dia punya then I was ah before this I also like quarantine different time kat saudi kan so I was also keeping up to this malay drama dia I think episode thirteen pasal because of COVID dorang tak boleh film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
oh my god but aku pun before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama lah K drama malas gila so damn long
no but it's so annoying is like ah no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together macam
iya lah ya lah I know but like I just I cannot no but that one I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that one I like and then the other one uh was when this dude ada breast cancer or something uh ya breast cancer ah
ya cerita lama
um apa like what cerita
that's why I cakap I tak suka tengok K drama cause it's so draggy
six times I swear every time she macam ah I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because kita tak boleh keluar right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime ke or a cartoon macam disney you know those kind of thing oh my god like macam fictional punya movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like macam one hour so attached to freaking marvel punya ah like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever ah bila apa uh uh ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like dia punya macam fake anak macam you know work to spiderman lah other than that like than I was like wah
that makes me macam happy already
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like macam marvel like after ni before I masuk uh I watch end game aku tengok like the whole movie sequence before that
then aku baca just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like macam warmth and comfort knowing that macam whatever at least spiderman ada girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like macam they did like alternate these stories of like that story
I mean the purpose tak semestinya untuk for that but macam mostly people macam when you like something so much like you crave for more what macam if you kau pernah tengok spiderman kan
you know how spiderman uh uh spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right macam peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland sekarang ni is like peter parker and but tak banyak movie of peter parker and what so people make fan fiction of it then kita macam oh my god imagine ah so happy
ya it's okay tapi aku baca fan fiction just like just to make myself happy lah you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
like what korean dramas kau tengok
how about is it that intrigued macam like
tak pernah like tak classy
like everytime hor I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare what like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so macam
no but general in general like if you want to buat like if you want to macam buat the drama tau like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel kau pernah tengok hotel del luna right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot pasal religion that's why
ya cameo then he datang right
oh my god I remember aku tak think of that sia
at the end okay lah it's okay but kalau K dramas usually kalau cameo dia datang just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode jer
and also I've never heard of like macam korean drama buat second season
for real abeh maybe sebab dia macam hospital hospital
of course [lah]
now like it's way even at like this malay station ah some tiga atau sembilan they they showing hotel del luna now you know
oh my god oh my god park seo joon dekat suria
bukan eh I don't know
like dub macam orang lain cakap take over orang melayu is talking like they speaking in melayu
no but dulu-dulu when my nenek watch cerita like macam apa uh you know the channel one
so it's a korean singapore punya channel but dia cuma apa tunjuk like korean show like they dub you in malay so weird
tak suka seh it's so it's so
like so uncomfortable I don't know I don't like watching dub one even anime macam english hmm weird
but ya eww weird nya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any uh subtitle uh the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard macam buat jer lah like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person daripada this uh are actor ke apa entah dia macam oh ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like kau tahu parasite menang uh a few awards kan dekat america
so like uh I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people yang selalu macam dorang tak happy tau sebab a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people pun macam but why though pastu dorang macam cakap lah like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I tengok even I I tengok malay drama I pakai english subtitle tau
like even though I understand what droang cakap I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself
aku tak aku tak kan masuk tau aku kena dia aku kena tengok cakap apa
right I can I watched I I I scared I can see both you know I don't know how to explain is not I see both it's just like I can like if I hold my phone I just like tengok I can see both like I don't know how to explain but like I see both
tak ada ah sebab kadang-kadang okay because ada korean drama for me ah ada korean drama kan I don't know about you ah but from what I see right korean drama kan dorang ada banyak kalau you use the subtitle ah translation kan dorang banyak guna bombastic word tau
ya big word so I was like sometimes I take a few I take a few quite a long time to process tau apa yang dia tengah cakap ni tau
that's why I was like that's why that's why it took me quite awhile that's why I because that's because of that I have to like macam read it slowly ya so that's why macam kadang-kadang termiss apa dia cakap ya so I was like thinking are they actually memang
ya bombastic words atau dorang actually because of the translation then dorang guna big words
but I was like thinking macam if you watch malay drama english drama like I don't think they use very big big words
huh really macam apa seh
singapore punya oh my god malay drama tak boleh sia
paling tak aku tengok anak anak metropolitan that was long ago but I never even keep up I just
I didn't really understand the story I just know that they are like really like macam kids who like have problems that's all
anak metropolitan singapore
after that after that macam dia punya tu what
ya I don't understand seh how to use semua tak tahu
then tak boleh
huh you didn't even masuk like this year or like last year
ya I went like masuk oh my god last year I masuk banyak kali seh pakai pakai train
it was so fast no at first I was so sketchy tau aku macam oh my god mesti like lama mesti like boring and like tired tiring it wasn't even that long cepat gila five minutes jer
for real really the immigration was so fast but I don't know but I went during like macam the june holiday
five minutes I'm not kidding five minutes for my mum I I went many times right so the first time I macam I didn't count but apa but the orang cakap macam five minutes so the next time I came my aunt really taruk timer it was like four minutes and like uh fifty seconds four three ya she really put timer you know
tak tahu it was last year
but kalau woodlands shouldn't like it be like the water wasn't around the water area I don't know but I in the train but you know there's a train from singapore to right
ya it's so fast gila like that time aku pergi um dia ingat puasa lagi pergi situ pastu uh tidur kat sana tau okay pastu the next time I pergi I pergi pastu burger dekat uh pastu balik rumah balik like I didn't sleep at I only went back home because it was that fast
it doesn't even feel like five minutes it's like I was just sitting there nanti macam dah okay
cepat gila kan
even when I took the plane uh they say when I balik right from to singapore it wasn't even thirty minutes you know
but usually how long is it from from singapore to because aku tak pernah you I how many times have you been to I feel like I'm the only person yang tak pernah pergi
but it's not like macam okay ah this this this december holidays let's go like you and whenever you go to kau pergi sebab ada family business but then you macam okay we can also chill at the same time is that what you mean

oh my god that's why I heard this person from singapore dengan kawan dia like naik the motor pergi mana entah like wait
the driver okay will like damn I mean it's easy if you naik motor ah but then it's so cool to do that oh my god
I mean but but it doesn't I think people usually who go backpacking they they are going it for like the view mostly that's why they don't mind macam hotel like cheap ke apa ke at least as long as they get the view

oh alamak tak boleh jalan shortcut ni then my stupid dumb self literally walk like I really keluar I had to like cross I keluar daripada JEM really cross the road go to
do you understand kau faham tak I was thinking of how that shortcut was going to lead me to even though it's actually big box
I know I I took ah you know actually they close the shortcut then my mum macam huh really dorang tak pernah close pun pastu I was like ya ya ya they close pastu then petang we went again and then we went to westgate then I'm like wait and then my mum is like eh buka apa then I'm like gosh I hate myself
I was so confident I pergi aku jalan and then dia cakap tutup then aku jalan lagi then I'm like okay so it's really close that means I have to like walk like so far away to like from JEM to
I never I never look up you know I just masuk and like
I just need to know my ways see I'm just like not used to going out and that's why actually alone pula tu I'm still getting used to the idea I have to go out alone you know
I've never in my entire life I mean ya I mean okay cause it was saudi so I've never because of saudi I tak boleh keluar like no matter how how old or how young you are like if you are a girl usually cannot leave the house alone
they will get asked by the dajjal
protected it's haram right haram
orang yang not that yang
oh so the the ones yang ada faith and yang ada iman yang kuat they will be they will get protected
oh the real like muslim like one yang betul betul like hold faith
you will be strong enough you akan react out which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
no matter how I I think no matter how macam you you even if you pernah experience pun I feel like if it's at that time truly you can never imagine like how you will react unless you for real for real like you can believe in yourself lah like your faith
ya so macam cool seh and australia kan
is it hiroshima yang ada nuclear
is it when you masuk that macam fake rumah then it
like macam what's like apa yang macam
no but I feel like I feel like if uh aku like hopefully not if aku like if ever if there was ever a time where there was an earthquake aku rasa aku akan panic to the point I will not hide under table I will just and then like suddenly everything fall on my head then like
I feel like no matter how much I prepare for something like maybe if it's not enough like I even if I prepare for it like aku aku tak akan when I panic aku tak kan think straight at all
as long as dia boleh protect your head should be fine lah
I mean dia if you you akan obviously kena squish kena squash by the building but as long as you tak kena uh ni apa fracture your head ke apa ke should be okay that's like the most important part what
ya I feel like macam when like when like uh whenever I see macam yang apa earthquake punya macam what's that word macam dia punya aftermath like you know how they find the people in the building semua
the ones alive their their their okay but maybe their kaki yang stuck kat dia punya macam I don't know like a hard apa benda entah
I mean obviously lah earthquake semua ni it's all in god's hand like it can happen anytime whenever it wants to
this COVID jer I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back pun ada the spanish flu which was also like
macam a few decades ago I guess
ya but still macam like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history macam memang tings like this happen like even if it's not common
but it was a big thing in saudi seh in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised aku tak tahu yang SARS is a big thing in middle east
and but I don't think when it happen kat singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
dorang ada vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a macam what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory punya virus
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just orang sakit tiba-tiba
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which aku still tak boleh brain
we have to do an assignment and it was like oh what what do you what what can you write a macam essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self macam like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so gila like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird tak boleh seh
no but then I'm so impressed with the I was I was so shock when I saw like the news I was so impressed that after three months this was like the twenty seventh obviously lah macam I mean it's death like it's not good no matter how much how much or how little like it's not great but compared to other places I'm so impressed that
it's like it's like serious that you have to go to hospital but not as serious you have to go to a like major hospital gitu
like the one day two day stay that dekat hospital that kind of thing
I tak dengar seh I didn't know that
chey I tak tahu seh I thought that was like a centre research centre or something I was like why this hospital is so damn big
so kau nampak yang hospital
how many rumah dorang nak seh there are so many rumah sekarang kat singapore tak apa pun
but then like they now this now slowly right where like for my situation right now like in saudi they do this like apa saudi I don't know lah basically dorang nak kick out semua foreigners and they want to make the their own people work
that's why my dad suruh I pindah balik kat singapore cause he takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang then like I'm in the middle of school then macam tak baik tak tak nice right for me to suddenly like ditch
but I mean alhamdulilah lah maybe rezeki it's better to also
actually dia kerja sana buat apa eh
no no there's this one type I mean I think it depends like sometimes he kerja in the office and then sometimes like there's this banyak kali aku bau dia punya freaking oil like I really hated the smell bro it like petroleum punya smell like it was so in the house and I thought was going to die you know
for real bau dia kuat gila
pakai oil semua kan
bila time kerja
it's not busuk but it's like you think you so chemically eh
like you you bila you smell you macam oh my god I'm gonna die
but that one is like macam refine oil macam dah
got difference it's like raw black oil so maybe pasal tu bau dia macam weird sikit
ya duh that's the thing no the thing is about oh bila bapa aku balik I I can't even see any stain on him you know
sama lah I also
because bila food
but nugget pun chicken what
if it's one lauk for the rest of my life
apa sambal goreng pengantin with ketupat or with nasi
or sambal goreng pengantin with bergedil and nasi
and sis tak akan get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent makanan yang I crave for is
sambal goreng pengantin lah
like ya because to me like sambal goreng pengantin is
sebab you will have everything there
you got paru
ada veggie ah ada sambal kacang panjang
ada chicken
hati ayam pedal eh hati ayam ke pedal eh
limpa eh
bukan eh hati ayam kan
ah so sambal goreng pengantin is like everything that I like to eat is what macam satu dish you makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap seh
but it's considered one what tak eh
oo tak consider eh
why why macam why like that
what tapi itu lah okay lah tak apa lah sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi sis
pulut begitu jer
pulut tak ada rasa sis
pulut lah but you cannot put other lauk
ah tahu lah pulut
because pulut is one dish
the pulut is not a makanan it's not considered lah
because food is life tengok lah badan kita sis
bodoh bodoh
habis sis nak makan apa make up your mind
oo if kita boleh
choose like macam
a dish tak
ada sugar cane
but dia tak ada dia tak ada limited hours you boleh duduk dekat dalam kan
macam if you go yang kita pergi dekat yishun tu yang tu kan if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but yang dia dinner dia up to four hours around three and a half hours lah macam tu
maybe because dia macam on the wheel sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like kenapa Seoul Garden tak boleh extend dia punya duduk dekat dalam
itu lah but if like pun ramai orang masuk apa
mana Seoul Garden Seoul Garden kita duduk sebelum dua jam seh
or exactly two hours then kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu full
so maybe next time we can try lah duduk dekat dalam
for like two hours plus and tengok kena halau ke tak
we should we should apa what's the word ah bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
yang is because dia tak ada they should buat air dalam jug taruk dekat situ
macam Seoul Garden so it's easy pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang the person hantar air
lambat seh
ah lepas tu nanti orang tu get irritated
macam that time pasal naan tu
the person yang get irritated
mm lepas tu dia
macam food lah unlimited food
okay let's say let's say tak ada COVID
so if sis only have to keluarkan duit makan sis have no problem with that
so yang lain so kita bayar makan jer lah like okay lah let's say makan pun alah depends ah
feeling orang kaya because it's fully paid for
sis macam nak makan korean food jom kita fly pergi korea
habis oyster kat mana yang sedap eh was it
the only the the two places that I managed to pergi was
dengan Seoul Garden
and Seoul Garden is totally macam
mm ha macam gitu
woo sis main air satu hari
kalau both of us ah dekat situ ah
kan macam gitu lah
but bora bora is more cantik
but they say yang if they want yang siapa eh they share dia punya travel experiences to see the ah si aifiqah ke mana siapa entah dia kena tidur dekat luar seh then macam imagine it's freezing
oh ya sis terlupa pasal itu ya
oh sis pun nak pergi turkey especially yang dekat hot air balloon punya tempat tu apa cappadocia wah
err dia orang boleh naik all the time you know it's not available all the time it's like terlalu windy cannot then kalau hujan cannot
macam siapa eh that time pergi dia pergi then tak straight away dapat then they have to wait like a few days after that
but they say dekat turkey it's haunted
ya turkey punya sihir eh turkey punya black magic is very very scary
bulan puasa jin is outside only syaitan is locked
so it's like that sis the logic because adik sis pun bulan puasa kena sampuk ya
ya turkish turkish people is very scary dia orang kalau buat buat sampai mati dia orang tak fikir tau dosa dosa pahala dia orang go straight punya dia orang berani mati punya orang tau
ya and dia orang punya macam and
dia orang macam I think dia punya polis eh when it comes to orang mati pasal sihir I think it's a norm thing like I think unusual death is macam benda biasa untuk dia orang
if you watch dabbe sis watch sampai terngiang-ngiang okay
like they can even like sanggup buat mak dia sendiri
yang the latest one eh ke apa
a'ah habis perempuan tu she's aware that
husband ada affair
lepas tu dia buat macam semua kena tau if you watch eh dia macam pretend that dia tak tahu apa-apa pasal dia yang buat
I don't know it's no dia buat mak dia
mmhmm ada nanti macam dia ada macam revenge macam
apa macam tadi you say about mak apa issue ah
like family issues I don't know lah lepas tu buat sampai adik dia gila and something like that lah
the anak buat lah anak dia buat mak dia dengan adik dia
kakak dia yang jahat lepas tu kakak dia nak revenge cuba you watch again
no kakak dia pergi pergi dekat ilmu sihir tu then when the person want to help her the orang yang ilmu sihir tu orang orang yang ilmu sihir tu terus mati he met the ilmu sihir tu tau
yang tukang ubat tu yang si bomoh tu tau
don't want sis tak nak being haunted again it took me a lot of time to still forget about it you know
a'ah a'ah lepas tu kan dia buat macam husband dia ke perempuan tu bunuh kan
the girl the girl yang doctor tu jahat the girl is a doctor what
so bila sis tengok cerita tu sis macam wow like so many things then bila orang tu figure out everything kan
turn turns out macam orang tu pun mati
ke orang tu
ya the tukang ubat tu pergi jumpa yang sihir konon very popular tau
the after dia ada jumpa
like macam perempuan tu jahat
dia cakap kan perempuan tu cakap aku tak suka perempuan ni aku tak suka perempuan ni
so the girl can see tapi lelaki tu macam kau merepek ah macam itu
err macam to to the guy macam he is in between believing macam dia dia as
dia percaya in the unseen as part of faith
cannot mix with science what so he's trying to do both tau to be like nak try to make a logic of that
but ya lah pasal logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but benda unseen ni
we cannot macam
and it's not of our faith to like rukun iman we have to believe in the unseen sebab tu
I don't know lah sis ingat nak pergi
yang macam sis dengar tadi yang cakap dekat situ is cheap yang ada buffet tu halalan toyyiban
ya ke I thought like no lah they showed example if it's eighty dollars eh let's say the amount is seventy five dollars you still it's better you pay seventy dollar then five dollar you pay cash ah dia begitu but that dia tak cakap kena breakdown in how many parts what dia cuma cakap cannot stack
cannot stack that is not macam tak boleh is not refundable
dia cuma cakap begitu jer apa so I think I can pay one ticket ah
it that time dia punya normal ticket is sixty plus sixty eight then express you tambah ten dollars jer seh
ten ke fifteen dollar so it's around eighty plus lah
but cat cat tak boleh bawa masuk dalam
ah dia ada nya turkey
but that time sis makan tempat dia punya yang dekat shrek punya tempat eh
ya sis nak try then dekat mana eh is makanan india
because sis pergi dua kali the first one is
like makan and everything sponsored
bedek seh
sis tak dapat pergi pun
one is at night time because masa tu is like a charity event
so sis dapat masuk malam it's from seven to eleven only
but tak ramai orang ah and the queue is not a lot so sis tak payah beratur panjang but imagine
but imagine pergi jurassic park punya tempat malam-malam sis for a minute there sis panic
yang dia punya ride yang air tu
habis kan dia naik kan
sis dah panic sis nya claustrophobic coming
yang dia duduk yang macam yang dekat roundabout circle kan begitu nanti dia warning then naik
dia macam begitu dah ternaik kan naik tinggi lepas tu dah dekat atas terus shoot begitu
ya I had fun too basah
that time yang yang kita nak try mummy sekali mak dia sampai pujuk the mother pujuk me untuk naik tapi mak tak takut kalau mak penakut ni mak rasa tak takut means it's not scary at all
mmhmm mak dia don't like to take ah roller coaster mak dia scared of roller coaster
a'ah mummy is always long queue then I asked the guy you know yang dekat situ is mummy ride scary
no lah to me if you ask me roller coaster tu lagi scary
then macam dekat sini cuma gelap sahaja lah begitu
but no but the tepi got the drying station what
eh halloween horror nights let's say if you pergi for the halloween horror night right so that means all the rides is still ada lah
then hantu-hantu tu
sis jerit tak
terkejut a'ah lah
sama lah without the express ticket lah
but I think halloween horror nights more people daripada biasa because people nak pergi haunted houses dia
sis nak pergi yang that time punya halloween horror nights yang ada kak pon tu
sebab dia orang cakap bila dia orang buat and the the no no he just gave birth
he wanted to ajak me then sis was thinking then sis macam should I go sebab I heard cerita that masa dia orang make the kak pon punya tempat they malam tengah malam bila nak dia orang nak tutup I think dia kena kacau what
kak pon hmm
oh dekat situ then
maybe she don't want to tell people because nanti orang tak nak datang
ya nothing will scare the shit out of me unless benda tu
a'ah and benda melayu because sis macam melayu
serious dia orang sabah also believe in benda-benda voodoo
oh orang asli is scary also you know
oh that time kan ada yang macam ah there's this exhibition right that macam museum kan exhibition dia buat yang macam you asked me nak pergi ke tak like benda-benda black magic
I don't know lah dia ada macam keris the keris tinggi lepas tu ah dia tangkap the toyol the toyol in the jar and everything ada kak pon paku kak pon
it was it was two years ago lah but where is I think it's at pasir ris the the apa
ya ya I remember it's there because ah I remember hafiz telling me that you want to go like it seems fun lah then I said like macam but it's scary sebab si
jian cheng pergi so I'm not wrong lah
macam dekat situ then ah dia punya bulu roma like betul-betul diri
because the keris is not a normal keris sebab keris tu is
dah fuse black magic
kan tiba
was it dia tengah driving ke apa no eh no no no no that was in aerostar bay eh
ha engkau tak kelakar eh brother
it's not funny sia you not funny lu lu cari pasal sama wa brother
in islam we believe right kalau kita mati our roh does not exist co-exist in this alam already so that means we are in another dimension tau so our dimension only macam co-exist time we sleep betul tak so like for example if kita mati kita nampak orang-orang people then if
is it the roh of the people or is it ghost or like jin in a form of people
jin or syaitan lah but is it
a really roh atau jin in a form of
ah manusia
apa sia
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn rumah tu semua is actually not because of to have rumah for them and others right
it's actually to show that ah bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita or something like that
what if like life is like that ah then the miskin like got tak ada chance seh
you just imagine eh kalau kita macam the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe orang dekat sana
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you macam too depressed and you tak boleh happy tu cakap you it's like a lot story in the news that people bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision atau
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin apa
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin lah so that's why I say macam
so even if kita kita tak ada duit pun it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do lah kita bunuh diri kita sendiri
kau bunuh people
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money what you you ah yo hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar gets into the head dia stress sangat then macam
socked in the head then terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa is it happens
but we don't know what like macam some people depression macam too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve dia punya debts then they kill
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim eh let's say lah even if you have a chance syurga then if you still have to stay in neraka like you never know how long you have to stay in neraka
and one other story is like macam like sometimes it it gets to me yang macam ah
they say the first thing that will be questioned in alam kubur or in the hereafter is solat like if
if kau the first question like solat kau tak pass yang benda lain semua tak matter already
then it gets to me lah then macam then some people say like some mazhab say ya you no need to pay balik yang
the solat that you missed ah solat just solat taubat then you just try not to do it again
but some people some mazhab say you have to pay back after every solat like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until kita mampus then I asked I asked some people lah let's say kan macam how are we going to know how many solat that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay lah let's say kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis that at times kita solat juga
repay oh maybe if tak
I I wanted to I wanted to ask lah if let's say kita because we are busy in this world kan kita kejar kejar kejar kejar sometimes we don't have time to qada kan so let's say in a sense that kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh
like let's say like aku because of the missed prayer kan
then sis taubat so maybe macam sis susah nak tidur malam then the only time that I can wake up is pukul tiga pagi onwards ah
so maybe that's the time that like macam can be it macam not ganti lah like can it help or not
kan sis macam takut tau let's say macam I want to be prepared macam sis want best of both world I want macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat so let's say macam kita dekat dunia macam ini jer macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam we are already bad dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini
ya just like the story yang yang the orang yang bunuh yang the ninety nine killer or something like that or yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu then dia repent
dia repent dia mati dia masuk syurga because the person say no he didn't belum he haven't tau taubat because allah take his niat as orang tu cakap oh engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang first the first pergi dekat first ustaz ni he went there lepas tu ustaz tu say oh kau tak akan diampunkan lah kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua something like that lah so he out of geram he killed the ustaz
dia kill the ustaz you know
ah then he went to this another ustaz then the ustaz was saying oh ah kalau kau nak berubah if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place macam tempat yang lebih baik lah so he ah kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama something like that
no this is another ustaz so he dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place dia meninggal mati so bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga
ya because niat dia because dia belum taubat lagi tau he tak tahu apa-apa because he just on his way to nak taubat to get out of the place then he already get to syurga so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the niat that matters lah
tapi dah maki lah tu
ya lah tapi maki jer lah
so if you want to maki just maki jer lah kan
moral of the story is all based on out niat what so if like allah decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins dengan kita punya doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of jannah
tapi tak minus
dah ada stated there
I hope for that ustaz also yesterday that macam he's saying lah macam we should educate our child
that be modest penting is part of islam and all but kita pun kena ajar anak kita that you know doesn't mean that dia tak pakai tudung she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child macam what islam is all about since young and it starts from asar dia cakap
ya lah macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap oh dia tak modest dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik it's not a good thing ah to me personally lah because pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan is all masing-masing
I think just now ah flying all my tudung then macam apa ni ten
lam soon singapore ke tadi
kurang ajar eh what
kita dah pernah kena judge lah that's why we don't we know how it is kalau people judge us
like sis pernah kena judge masa sis kerja dekat ah my previous workplace yang kat tai seng tu kan
ah I I apa after I started pakai balik tudung right
slowly lah I think after that dah dua tahun ah but it's still slow still new lah then masa tu ah I was judged by one of the co-workers lah dia macam
aku tak suka ah perempuan pakai tudung then I asked why lah then dia macam oh semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak jer baik but behind semua hisap rokok lah ambil laki orang lah I macam who are you to judge like macam just because satu orang buat kau nak judge aku macam itu
ya lah but it's not perempuan pakai tudung jer buat apa yang tak pakai tudung also buat what
so why are you judging just because we wear tudung wear tudung doesn't mean yang kita ni malaikat what
and then sis macam tak puas hati lah kena judge macam itu
step baik
kurang ajar sia
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are semua pun macam tak betul how
at first sis was like sis dah jadi defensive lah because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends semua tak nak friend with me
because macam alim begitu kan she don't wan't to friend with me sebab she say ah kau dah pakai tudung
then buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat
then I say to her lah tak semestinya that I wear tudung aku baik seh
I wear tudung is because I wanted
change for agama lah
like sis want to change like sampai bila nak jadi macam itu maybe if I wear tudung it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to macam jaga diri in public
like sometimes kita dekat public kita
you know like macam dulu I never wear tudung then sis pakai baju low cut and nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk tau
our intention is not macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun but nampak
so macam to me it elak fitnah
a'ah especially especially if you wear niqab
when you wear niqab right dia punya niat is to stay away from guys right to macam
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern nya days if you wear niqab instead you attract more guys
you kau tak normal apa like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
hmm a lot of guys are macam itu sekarang
masa yang si nurul tu kan then yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin kan dia pakai niqab kan
not the ex one lah the girl that she's getting to know lah yang dah kahwin
when she wear niqab dia nampak cantik lah like you will imagine her to be a cantik girl so many girls are adding her tau
memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab she is very she is wearing niqab what so she delete all her pictures yang tak ada niqab
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear niqab
but sis don't want to be macam tu but sometimes
ada apa you know in malaysia ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab
dia pakai niqab and then she's very young then macam nampak mata jer kan then she berbual very lembut very lemah lembut
ah then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like macam wah lemah lembut then muka kau cantik
then I when I was having this conversation with hafiz I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear niqab lah because the purpose of wearing niqab is to grown away daripada attention what
so if like aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku then lepas tu aku berbual begitu
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know kita dekat public eh bodoh lah like that
because sometimes when we wear tudung also our cara cakap also still the same what
err pakai pakai niqab
you nak jaga macam mana nak makan then macam like sometimes when we talk to guys like
tak tak open masuk kat masuk kat bawah lah tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah
then macam I say macam I hear perempuan pakai niqab I hear dia orang macam giggle macam gedik like I don't like
maybe because I have unresolved issue with perempuan pakai niqab
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue macam
like neelofa ah macam neelofa
so macam so
people lagi macam have a better understanding of islam
so if kau react wrongly people macam oh orang islam macam ini lah
then I've asked myself if I were to wear niqab then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes ah like macam to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like macam if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing hijab I am not wearing properly
so sis jawab apa
people will judge us name like makcik-makcik
mmhmm maybe we should maybe we should start doing that lah macam neelofa you know like
she change the misconception that macam oh pakai
purdah mesti boring but if she change ah dia tak macam sparkling macam
tak macam there's bling sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam okay lah
so if you that's why they say when you pakai benda ni you are sacrificing the things that women like most
cantik lah
then remember mak saying you know like when you want to wear niqab when you want to wear purdah
because you are attracting people like if kau dah buat macam gitu that is
oh no problem lah okay lah kau kan members aku

eh wait but the thing kan but the thing is kenapa dia nak tanya kita pasal intern bila kita dah habis intern and kita intern sama timing pe and now we schooling again
kenapa eh
is it is it supervisor dia orang lelaki or something like that
plymouth ah K that I heard jadi he can actually do it lah but the thing is the main topic sekarang is kenapa dia selalu awak ah
kenapa bukan saya saya yang single awak yang dah attached pe dia cuma message
tak tapi saya expect
okay saya tak expect apa-apa tapi kenapa dia message awak lebih daripada saya ah I think because awak lebih friendly ke awak lebih friendly looking saya garang sikit
awak kena faham eh badan awak petite biasanya siapa yang petite orang lain akan tengok as macam lebih sopan lebih lembut
percayalah saya saya tahu kita sama height tapi
saya lagi besar awak lagi sempurna okay K let's not talk about this okay tak proper kita boleh tukar topik dia K jadi nak saya bilang apa jadi pada saya dah
K kalau awak notice kan kehidupan saya tetap tenang sahaja
tak banyak complication kerana saya tak berbual sangat dengan orang lain jadi saya tidak ada banyak masalah lagi-lagi
okay ya lah tak kelakar okay jadi lepas tu I
nak message ah cakap thank you terima kasih like I usually do that for every outing like even if kita
I go out with you kan I always say macam thanks for today ke apa semua then
nak message dia nak message dia then suddenly dia nowhere to be seen tak boleh nampak profile picture dia cannot even see his contact profile or whatever
then I ingatkan oh maybe whatsapp glitch ah whatsapp glitch jadi
err tak ah kita dah nampak muka each other kita dah nampak then the thing is
my profile picture were tak catfish ah dia punya profile pic pun sama then the thing is he look so cute why why are the cute guys like this
oh dah okay ya basically every single social media platform and then tak nampak dia lagi and
that time lah eh saya just tahu dia tak suka saya tapi that's okay pasal
dah biasa kan online biasanya dia orang cakap apa ghosts ah ghosts I got ghost stick in my life
tapi tak apa lah ni kehidupan kan manusia what to do it is what it is jadi awak ada calon apa-apa lain tak untuk saya
calon apa ya
ah tapi dia bising lah
tapi tak semestinya dia lagi tua daripada saya dia apa secucuk how do how do you say that in english ah
jauhkan aku dari adik-adik ya that's true
ah okay wait how do you even know him same madrasah or school or
okay faham juga but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
bantah no no no no bantah is you shake right
kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain in a
in a macam manja-manja way of course lah mana boleh gitu kita dah ada boyfriend of course kita kena setia kan jadi macam I prefer kalau dia macam
berbual dengan saya eh you are my girlfriend seh eh janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita happy sama-sama
oh my god wait tak
ah apa ah are you serious
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story kan jadi I was also confused lah apa tengah jadi ni then err girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
and the thing is kan all this time dia baik dengan saya tau dia tak pernah tak senyum pada saya dia selalu macam senyum nanti dia hug kalau nampak saya
muka muka dua ular kepala dua err agaknya ah
dengan pelik seh story gitu yang oh lagi satu saya nak bilang ah
bukan bukan nama saya jer yang dalam story itu kawan-kawan lelaki kawan-kawan lelaki tu yang perempuan dia pun letak nama dia orang sana
lelaki itu bukan gay lelaki tu straight cuma lelaki tu
ada juga kawan perempuan takkan tak ada kawan perempuan kan ya jadi yang ex girlfriend ingatkan dia tipu perempuan tu dengan saya tapi
apa mm mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
saya tak tahu lah saya tak nak cakap apa-apa saya tak nak buka aib dia nanti saya yang kena eh kena jadi saya pun tak cakap apa-apa pasal tu ah saya just diamkan mm
err saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya eh bilang awak tak apa lah nama dia orang semua tapi ni jer lah yang saya boleh bilang awak
yang lelaki tu kawan saya saya saya dah memang tak suka lelaki tu ah
saya cuma ah nampak lelaki tu sebagai kawan baik saya macam abang-abang
tak tak tak dia hanya kawan sahaja dia nampak saya sebagai adik saya nampak dia sebagai abang itu lah kita
punya perhubungan ah kalau faham lah jadi ramai orang pun tahu kita tak suka
a'ah satu sama lain macam kita yes correct we are just platonic friends but a lot of people know that
jadi my supervisor ni melayu you my mentor pula cina lah then kan ni sebelum COVID jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama kan jadi saya yang kena pass
uh all these work to let's say kalau dia cakap kena pass err find me to another person kan err jadi I just do that lah tapi nanti
the person I pass it to semua they tell me that it's wrong I'm not supposed to do that then I have to go back you get that feeling
oh okay but the thing is yang the company itself should also update their tablets or their or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
naik turun bukit you know what let's let's grab this topic completely I want to forget about intern
but most of them still think that we are macam or they have a choice to not choose because I feel like
saya pun confused ah tengok bual-bual pasal apa ni okay tapi tapi saya faham lah saya faham awak kena ah
um okay K saya faham juga melayu kita memang hancur apa yang awak dapat grade untuk secondary ke primary school leh
saya saya dapat B three juga agaknya tapi ah
I do well bilang saya untuk retake kertas tu tapi saya tak bagi pasal uh saya memang tahu saya tak akan ada time untuk belajar untuk bahasa lain atau topic lain
tapi tapi akhirnya tetap fail
awak awak ingat tak yang that time kita tengah
nak cepat-cepat habiskan project sir farhan
then kita tak pergi class kita pergi library
then ah ya ya that one and then uh mister farhan ke miss judy yang pergi library caught all of us dekat sana
ya dia yang tangkap kita semua ah
ya I was there ah saya dekat sana then they nampak saya okay
the thing is kan yang that hari itu tangan sedang berdarah uh
tangan saya berdarah dengan saya tak nak um
lipat saya eh saya tak nak buka sleeves saya jadi ah ku tak nanti baju saya kotor kan kena darah semua
ya jadi saya lipat lah saya punya sleeves then ingat saya cuba potong tangan saya kerana saya sedih ya betul
dia dia ah lepas dia dah marah semua orang dalam library dia panggil saya untuk berbual dengan saya dia dia tanya saya saya okay ke tak lepas tu dengan saya tak tahu kenapa dia
dengan dia punya ketabahan tabah mean apa ya
oh eh okay saya tak tahu perkataan dalam melayu tetapi dia dengan confidencenya dia tanya saya awak sedih kerana awak punya agama tak kasih saya suka perempuan eh tak kasih awak suka perempuan eh
apa lah perempuan ni lepas tu saya cakap tak tak saya saya memang saya saya suka lelaki saya suka saya saya suka perempuan tapi ah ada ada limit dia lah yes

and then also like the rumah like
um we have to have heated floors ke heated jamban atau katil ke
lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil kan bila kita tidur like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about oh so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
so untuk saya untuk saya ya untuk for me right I want to bring them to
flower species and then can can exist all in one place habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada four seasons every country not ah countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since kita takde four seasons kita boleh lah kita pergi gardens by the bay kan to look at the different flowers and also different uh month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
family is it poor family happy family ah sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like wow so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like err last time it was easy to get right tapi sekarang macam like
mana eh nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda modern so macam I pun fikir lah like wah how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also macam not so complicated and then also about games
um nanti kalau like if you bring tourists over to play games kalau kita tak berbual the same bahasa pun takpe because you know you just gitu gitu gini gini then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed lah I also like reality uh so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like wow so this can happen in real life ah then like because like macam I'm quite curious lah on like
people story tapi takkan macam I nak keluar habis tanya orang eh jadi macam mana you punya life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people punya
jalan hidup without being so kaypoh about it
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like tengok dia orang macam like kitchen nightmare dia punya
ah chef of the restaurant then dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak gordon ramsay pun bantu dia punya restaurant kasi betul this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so macam err
naive and like oh or tapi uh
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so macam senang nak percaya and then tapi like when I watch this also I can feel sad lah because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and macam they cannot dapat that connection dalam real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing macam have you experienced something like that or like
for me my favourite movie banyak juga lah tapi macam ada satu jadi ada satu movie ni yang I suka
macam my kat my handphone kat tepi jadi I tengah buka my computer jadi tangan tu I took out a keyboard my kepala facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
tengok I tu tengah macam ah bekerja ni eh tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata I tu tengah tengok bollywood kat tepi tu
and like cerita bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
I think uh also the thing about watching this uh a lot of times with different people right it makes me uh find out more about err the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan ah then dia orang akan pick up different things that you didn't see
picked up in this movie so I think macam gitu it's quite cool to like tengok err with lain orang ah to see macam dia orang punya perspective tu semua ya and then like um
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like uh this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like wah damn cool leh macam macam and then like
mm I pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini so it's actually dari sana lah tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive lah it's like
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also macam quite interesting
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually bila I dengar soundtrack
sometimes when I watch movies also lepas saya tengok movie tu I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know uh how the song sound like all that ya what what
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes kerana saya seorang yang tamak
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace jadi pasal err
lebih ramai lah jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati blah blah blah and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like masuk dalam and I pakai baju and I tengok cantik ke tak eh and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park wow I don't have to queue eh
do wanna be invisible because macam quite
uh apa ni freeing lah ya freeing then err nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so kan I can beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa I kan pasal tak nampak pun ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni mahal lah satu tahun lima puluh ribu so you imagine kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu uh
err ribu puluh ribu kali tiga it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
yang tu caranya a lot of money so then and then uh I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like uh I remember uh
saudara where they had to lay antara dapat duit bursary atau budak tu move on to a better education so kalau budak tu dapat duit bursary maknanya dia kena stay in
uh not so not the best education untuk dia and then if that that budak goes on to uh a better education he might not get
uh the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education macam it helps to break poverty cycles lah
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they ah have to choose between these two and both are important right ah yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran ya oh ya another thing actually very important uh
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay kita pergi dia punya uh apa ni petrol station nak pergi toilet nak pergi toilet tak kat ah
ah petrol station dia nampak tak dia punya jamban so many different
okay so my friends and I kita selalu berbual how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies tapi kita tetap couldn't kerja because kita perlukan duit right
oh ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right macam people ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening err she has made a lot of friends eh from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya
eh awak sini berkebun eh then they ask her eh can I join or not like
for me my hobbies has always been arts lah I really like arts whether it's like macam music atau
makeup eye makeup lukis ke apa kan it's very fun and like uh I think about hobbies
see like uh what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right jadi apa you punya favourite lagu eh
apa-apa genre lah
kalau lagu melayu kan lagu melayu I ingat macam more
to bahasa indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff lah I think my bahasa indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia kan macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam memory lah dia nak simpan memory tu dia tak nak lupakan uh actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs lah and it's also by an artist that I really like uh actually last year the dia ada datang singer last year maybe last year atau dua tahun lepas dia datang singapore tapi I tak tak pergi alamak
what about like live music err pernah ada pergi tak dengan experience ke tak live music
concert yang macam paling memorable tu dengan my sister juga ah ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok coldplay oh actually an interesting thing about this was uh
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right jadi dia orang nak jual at
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable lah tapi dia punya bila part beli tiket itu pun memorable but in a sedih punya memory ya
oh ya I mm what about macam mm ni punya fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then pasal
setiap orang kan ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you uh ya do you believe in love at first sight
apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik eh
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this ciri-ciri jadi I suka orang ni lah
pelik ya
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish mm how can I don't know about dish lah but I think right for I kan you know my mesti I pilih okay antara syrup limau atau teh O ais limau
ya I think uh like teh O ice also I mean you can minum panas it stays great and then you can minum sejuk it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu lah mungkin ada tapi I tak tahu ya and oh so um
err apa ni kat airport tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan my makan tengah hari pun
sikit jer I think maybe just err what do they eat japchae ah japchae I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate japchae japchae is noodle ya ya
very big ah so I if I were to reach there I calculate lah like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the kedai tutup then mesti lapar kan so I remember I I I only bought kacang
habis tu I only ate in taiwan
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax jadi bila I nampak pokok I nampak
uh air air tenteram I tak fikir banyak I boleh dengar
I boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau jer but like there's so many different colours of green
ya like macam bunga-bunga pun
cantik very delicate
and then everybody macam just bersenam dalam dia punya taman
uh for me ah in the future future kan I uh I rasa macam my age lah like my my age right now um is fifty so that means in ten years time I'll be like sixty so sixty it is like more to finding a very uh peaceful kind of um life uh I I just want to enjoy the nature uh macam suka pergi tepi laut lah tepi laut then uh kita tengok apa pokok-pokok uh then um and having uh just a a few number of friends you know
ah you know talk about your you got kids talk about your uh your life about you punya health uh like that lah
ah betul betul betul macam kita nak apa beribadah gitu ah banyak kepada mungkin ukhrawi lah
tapi sebab tu lah nak kena ada macam apa tu orang kata uh barang-barang yang ada kena-mengena dengan sains lah okay okay okay okay okay
dia tengok time lah
martial arts ke action movie because that is really cray you know to me
uh it really like macam excite you uh you really makes you awake tau macam tak mengantuk you know at least at least eh when you watch eh your mind is not really working
uh their apa ni their actions dorang punya lawan-lawan ah martial arts jadi macam
best lah kalau dapat tengok cerita-cerita macam gitu
tapi tu tak selalu sangat lah that one's only like once in a while only but then sometimes you you
you you want to also watch uh like macam family punya kind of
ah kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan lah pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada fit body
of of course lah you have the looks you know tapi kalau your body doesn't fit
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like uh macam orang kata tu cerah lah ah macam glowing kan ah glowing so I mean it is
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about uh what to eat and what not to eat you see ah jadi dorang banyak macam ah apa tu tengok lah banyak pergi mana tu uh makan fast food kan ah you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
uh they always think yang the important is to to have a good looks you know buat expensive makeup you know and then wear ah good good clothes you know so that they will look good
younger generation need to be educate mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu lah kena banyak membaca
and then ah dorang kena tahu lah you know uh
macam mana nak apa tu ah mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
uh do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no lah I think from from ya I mean daripada awal dah kena start lah macam choose makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua
it is not really easy to say lah okay it's not easy to say because we do not know ah what are the experiences that ah you know people uh I mean orang orang orang experience
ah pengalaman orang kan cause everybody has their own experiences ada background yang berbeza
so jadi um this mental health ni
uh I mean okay lah memang makanan tu penting okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like macam they selit lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar ah that is already dah important lah you know because even then
ah secara holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that uh but I I take vegetables I take also uh I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know ah depression ke apa so I I so I rasa that um
I rasa it is how you manage lah the situation
ah how lah you manage and you did also like macam talk to people uh with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters eh macam like when youngsters eh kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri lah kita kena bercakap dengan orang ah bercakap dengan family tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang very menjayai you know
ah jadi sesama lah you tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah you kan
so kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh accept uh the first degree of stress
yang ada ah second third degree pun masih boleh terima
ah ya depends on dorang punya capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents pun tak boleh push ah cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind yang
mm nak ke mana eh mungkin zaman kanak-kanak lah
mm ye lah kanak-kanak sebab zaman kanak-kanak macam tak ada stress gitu
ah zaman kanak-kanak zaman yang kita tak fikirkan apa-apa ah tak payah nak fikir kita tahu kita makan tidur main dah ah you see I mean
mm uh macam best lah kadang bila kenangkan uh waktu kecil-kecil dulu uh when my late dad was around ah how I spent my time with my dad and then uh apa tu
mm bila kita sama-sama ah apa tu spend time balik kampung you know a lot of things and as a children you don't really think so much lah about like
ah then you woke again then you you like play again you know ah you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people punya problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people punya problems ya macam those memories are I think are the best lah
uh there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them lah but as for me my own experience um if I have a timer like what you say you know uh where where where do I want to go I nak pergi tu lah the my childhood life lah mm
so jadi um what you say you want to go to the the ages lah okay okay
I think peringkat umur lah eh I think uh that that that is the reason ah why like macam you you are still young you know
orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak uh kembangkan lagi pengetahuan
uh kan nak expand kan lagi your knowledge so jadi
you rasa sebab you perlu pergi to that ages you know to nak lebih mendalami lagi uh benda-benda yang you tak pasti benda-benda yang you tak tahu mm
apa lagi eh yang kedua ketiga apa eh okay lah yang pertama dulu lah kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap
oh okay maybe um wang lah ah I think oh I nak jadi seorang millionaire ah bukan sahaja healthy tapi my wish
kalau I ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa ah I mean not for myself but I think ah I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity ah I'm a very like macam
then bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak ah kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang so I think tu yang yang can give me the most satisfaction lah itu second wish lah second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish uh seorang jutawan ah kaya raya
ah takpe lah you dulu lah what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
since I have uh children so of course I I don't really ask ah more like of course lah as a a parent you want to see your children ah succeed in their life you want to see your children like macam
have and will be a successful because the of course that is uh memang tak terkecuali memang you nak tengok anak you berjaya
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people macam sombong gitu macam apa tu
uh tak nak dengar kata orang lain you know macam terlalu ego ke so I
err tidak ada perkara yang uh kekal dekat dunia ni so jadi uh whatever that you have whatever that cherish it lah cherish it and also share share among other people
people will like macam apa tu ah respect you lah respect you
you know ah in this life right manusia manusia ni dorang ah memang akan tengok pandang tinggi lah kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua kan
tapi kalau you berduit tapi you tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga
ah you see so the best thing is uh whatever it is ya buat yang baik lah kalau you ada duit pun tapi you sombong kan
ah so tak ada gunanya lah orang pun people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant ah you know you have a
kalau ada superpower eh kalau ada superpower I nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit
oh macam flash ah speed lah
ah macam tu macam speed gitu macam whatever that I want uh I do eh I want to do in a very fast manner
then I I I clean up the house right like macam wah habis one minute gone or two minutes wah all the house clean already semua dah bersih wah see I I I
uh I mean like then you can have apa orang kata tu relax lama-lama
ah rehat lama-lama ah but unfortunately I do not have that such power
um tapi kalau ada
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use uh apa
ah you know senang semua but okay dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu flip flip flip the pages ah sekarang tak payah sekarang ah sekarang ah you tengok jer youtube
ah you google jer okay nak cari resipi apa masak apa ah then you know from then on can you can already uh find the recipe that you want
main problem like contohnya I think for adults eh adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know ah they know when to use it you know uh they they know like macam when not to use it you know they they they have the orang kata tu tahu bila nak focus tapi kalau children memang talking budak-budak ni you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age eh
you have TikTok and dorang dah lah macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok TikTok sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat TikTok kan
ah kerja rumah semua terbengkalai then homework pun terbengkalai kan and then uh last time eh you see uh budak-budak dulu they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them eh cannot watch television ah you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them ah you see so
ah you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you suka tengok youtube you suka tengok netflix ah lagi sekarang netflix selalu dekat phone ah you see susah kan kadang-kadang
nak nak nak stop ataupun kita nak ketepikan mm handphone tu
um pun ada good and bad dia lah maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of uh you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it kan kalau were to take over humans kan then what humans going to do you know certain things boleh lah kan certain things I think um can you know take over humans tapi certain like macam profession tak boleh take over humans ah you know I think certain certain professions lah not all professions you know macam doctor you that's why boleh jadi doctor ah macam mana jadi doctor
I rasa patient tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan ah you see ataupun nurses take over nurses I I don't think so lah that's why I tell you macam certain professions uh memang tak kena lah kalau I mean take over
still need uh you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine kalau take over abeh kita ni nak kerja apa ah you know how to earn money like that
see so kalau macam humans kan lain humans kan ah humans ada limitation ah dia macam sponge kan humans dia boleh adjust
ah you see so ye lah and and to add to that and to add to your ini kan questions you tengok macam ah apa maid pembantu rumah
ah you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right ah you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe lah can but then in terms of you talking about eh taking after the old people don't know uh how to how to really like macam like you say lah human touch they lack of that
use use the app for for macam good purpose lah I think for cleaning up no problem because like like macam you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like macam uh I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like macam
uh thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up um like macam uh you do the job cleaners and all that uh simple simple job can take over lah
uh you know but other jobs that require uh you know you need deep thoughts ataupun kemahiran ah macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar kan macam doctor dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar kan so takkan you nak suruh take over kan mm you see
tengok lah tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang when you talk about technology in years to come ah macam-macam kan technology akan datang so jadi uh we'll see lah that
mana yang lebih perlu lah at which at which sector
rather than you know like sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah mental problem sekarang I think kalau ada kita nak adakan lagi um orang kata untu menggantikan uh all the professions uh orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah mental health problem
mm and and and one thing and one thing pun I think um if you nak have this right untuk menggantikan the soldiers pun not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war ah kan tak ada ramai lah human beings yang mati mm
no lah why dia tak marah lah tak tak lama pun kita tunggu like just maybe I think kita sampai about
I think two fifteen then we also understand that it was raining then I also tak kasi you the address right I forgot I didn't give you the address
no I'm sorry I tak kasi you the address
eh you ada assignment is it
then suruh jer lah dia teman you lunch ah
so now he's still marah
then jumpa lah dia accompany you belajar like go to err Starbucks or something
ya I like to go Starbucks dekat buona vista you know that Starbucks
cause tadi tadi we went to do the simulator
ah the simulator is very fast I think around macam twenty minutes gitu
ya it's it's damn stupid the simulator is damn bodoh like you ugh you should go for the simulator it's so it's such a waste of time they just wanna take your money that's all
ya but I think this sekarang two B nak kena ambil simulator kan
then oh then the apa</malay>[ah] time simulator tu they there was one part uh we were riding kononnya under the influence of alcohol
ah ya so stupid so dia nya screen dia macam
ya like fuzzy but still tiba-tiba the car on the right swerve into our lane then become our fault they say oh this is what happens when you driving under err influence of alcohol you cannot predict err accident
ya ya that's why suddenly you know the car swerve into our into our lane then I got I got a macam flashback of my accident that time yang time chinese new year
orh the parents asyik suruh kita balik like oh ah kita masakkan ni kita masakkan tu then kau balik lah makan kalau kau tak nak balik then kita tak buat kan you know that kind of thing
then you will rasa like feel bad what
I macam tak nak go home for dinner
oh my god hari-hari I makan benda sama babe kat rumah like it's always ah ada telur ada ikan ada prawn and it's like that every single
simon suka apa
my mum's today because every week week then we balik sana right so sometimes dia makan sana then I balik I tak makan
like balik bishan then I tak makan then macam I feel bad lah cause
ya then simon also kadang don't eat at my parent's but most of the time he will come home and eat at my place then he will balik and then he will eat again so that's why he become fat already
ada exam soon is it
four modules ya four modules is quite heavy though considering you ada full time job and
he he tak he's not studying right he's just working kan
oh so he expects macam the same the same thing lah
oh gitu but lain what
is baru tujuh minit seh
ya I think dalam tujuh tujuh minit gitu
mmhmm tapi kita hang out kita berbual pasal you know like tu
I mean I'll okay jer kalau nak berbual pasal you know
then sekolah is like um two point five years
anything happens and then I ada sekolah or then I also nak cari kerja what
ya I already like send out resumes and stuff tapi most tak get back
I apply for macam dental assistant like reception slash dental assistant and then there's also uh patient service associate
apa lagi I apply for reception uh
because I tak nak clashed dengan simon punya if I wanted like a shift job I dah police lah like what I wanted to do right
tapi ya like so far tak get back
ya no he's is err office hour paling lambat pun maybe around seven or kadang-kadang he on course night training then he will come home late lah but it's never
macam eat into the weekends unless uh on course or he ada duty ah then those are the times when it will eat into his weekends
ya and then plus apa
like shift job tak kesah apa like ke tak ke like you still need to go and work what
oh yes yes yes yes dia ada it's like morning but it's split into two right I remember you
I very macam um quite err
pressured lah cause like kadang-kadang the kakak will ask me
ah kau tak nak cari kerja ke as in not not directly macam kau tak nak cari kerja but more like um kau nak buat apa sekarang like oh uh kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah like you know this kind of thing then I I've I rasa macam a bit pressured lah it's not macam I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I kalau I pergi balik pun I tak nak jadi manager anymore lah it's very it was very shitty
and then sekarang pun they already increase um part-time punya pay to I think eight
ya I know right then dorang increase I lupa lah I punya pay berapa but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
sebab I can send simon to work
and then I boleh pergi kerja dari sana because he cannot ride to work mah
ya then only during this course yang they kasi him ride his bike tapi he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
err tak tahu eh he cakap nak naik bus tapi naik bus is very very far for him
ya is jauh gila
ya then cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah your
kita kat sana kita tinggal kat hall seh babe kat tilam and then for five days you wanna
like kita ada our own macam room at bishan and then macam I I don't feel comfortable lah kalau macam everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then macam no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want lah like I don't mind to macam pagi-pagi you ambil I punya bike you pergi sungei gedong then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay lah for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he punya reporting time is pukul like tujuh sometime enam setengah then pukul berapa nak keluar rumah you know
sungei gedong you tahu um kubur sana
like pusaraman
ya lim chu kang but lagi dalam
ah my house is very near to his workplace tapi takkan I nak duduk sana lima hari kan
oh my god no dia takkan kasi punya girl
she won't lah dia tak kasi punya lah dia tak kasi lah my sister is damn difficult to talk to she won't even have a conversation with me about her school
ya and then uh he cakap um nak kena tunggu dia habis tour dia baru
err he will maybe pergi nee soon camp then it will be closer to his workplace already eh I mean his house tapi
ya mandai but it's lagi lama lah lagi maybe around one year one point five years
cause dorang tak kasi ride bike right abeh macam orang regular seh ya exactly the dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi the naik motor like everyone in dia punya
uh what do they call name battalion I guess err tak boleh naik motor you can only naik public transport atau you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I belum kerja seh kita belum apply rumah belum kerja then you nak talk about having a car
a'ah I think you you you nak kena fikir about it's not just about petrol tau about like dia punya season parking berapa dia punya road tax berapa
ya that's why dia punya season parking dia punya ah apa what's that called ah road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like ah
I don't know I tak tahu apa is going on in his head that he thinks
ya macam I find tak
makes sense lah if you nak if you nak apa ni ah restrict from uh riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik bus
tak boleh because this thing is not um macam baru baru jer they say oh you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this macam they don't want to change it lah
ya it's damn kesian ah I see
then after that dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik bus jauh sia babe even I nak balik rumah I'd rather take my motorbike go home to choa chu kang apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja
dah lah satu bus jer pergi sana abeh it's also together with like the
ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
they dah lah tak cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
mm mm ya you're not really affected by macam
like the economy but I mean affected a bit lah it's not like you retrenched lah macam bonus dia tak dapat for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant kan tak dapat
err dia kena retrenched
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit macam
macam it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
tapi tak tak confirmed juga apa kalau we masih hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three
oh ya ya ya tapi
hais just I I I macam nak cancel the malay wedding honestly ah tak kesah also to like ah don't have the malay wedding
no I serious I tak kesah pun not to have the malay wedding sebab
leceh sia babe like already kahwin sia like it's no point I don't see a point in having a malay wedding anymore
but I already nikah macam tak tak perlu sia
just tak perlu lah babe serious I dah nikah abeh lepas tu um
ya I tahu I cakap that you know I have a baby next year but you know you never know when you have a baby and then kalau I let's say eh around maybe uh next month or what by december perut I dah besar babe like macam mana nak naik pelamin then kalau in that case I betul-betul pregnant by the time I nak ada a majlis
I punya perut dah besar then I nak kena tunggu I beranak dulu
I dah beranak I nak kena tunggu lagi I punya confinement nak kena settle down my my child and then bila nak ada the wedding tak perlu
I nak pergi nak suruh tolong
I pergi sengkang punya
I nak pergi lah nak appeal lah suruh dorang return I punya deposit lah sebab um dorang tak kasi I punya deposit balik
oh my god I punya I punya catering did I tell you about it
I punya catering oh my god was so freaking difficult they were so difficult with me
so at that point in time boleh ada uh majlis kan
so I punya invitation is two three hundred
so uh that time government kasi sampai two hundred and fifty so you can still have a wedding and everything
ah so I cakap dengan dorang lah ah err okay I still nak go on with the wedding ah tapi invitation two hundred fifty and I tak minta balik I punya duit cause I paid for three hundred pax right so I tak minta balik the fifty that um I paid for tapi I nak you
um macam
err so I I just say that lah then dorang cakap uh they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay boleh kita boleh err have the wedding tapi all the social distancing shit ah you settle
ya so ambil temperature semua you settle
mana boleh gitu sia babe
ya and then apa ni I paying you extra tau then after that dia cakap ah
ya dia punya contract basically saying kalau betul you punya wedding ada um COVID case ah you kena handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then dia cakap um
kita still akan cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to ah I'm still gonna give you what uh you paid for tapi everything else kau settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
tak lah I tak go on ah then after that uh they I think dorang tak rugi sebab that time kan tutup
then dorang tak boleh beli their barang from there what so they have to buy it from singapore what
and then after that I cakap dengan dorang lah I give like kata putus like that I say um
kalau sampai end of the year ah I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money sebab if you think about it eh duit yang I down dengan dorang belum pakai tau
like you all tak beli barang basah
like basically you all tak tak tak pakai ah duit tu
then the the basically you didn't spend ah my money I'm just paying for the instalment nasib baik I tak pay full ah dorang
so dorang punya dorang punya
I don't know sebab I dah bayar up until the last payment so that one is the after after wedding
because the payment pasal dah nak dah nak my wedding seh masa tu
ya I bayar I think err
cause three payments only I make three payments then the last payment is like after the majlis itself lah
ya so I dah bayar dorang
photographer yang dah bayar I still ada mak andam yang dah bayar
um for malay wedding ya that's all kompang I dah bayar as in like I already deposit lah
so I think maybe if if I tak pergi and tulis I punya deposit maybe almost eight K
ya ya exactly like no service is delivered how can you say macam they suffered losses like what losses there was nothing delivered
macam I tak touch anything I tak touch anything at all then how what what losses are you talking about when you didn't deliver anything there was no services delivered I didn't get any product

boleh lah boleh lah takleh gi dah
buat crochet jer kan tapi aku macam nak try
benda other than just macam bag pasal aku nak jual a few bags
tapi macam I want to try cardigan lah skirt
tapi aku takut because I need like macam time to try it out
macam model it out you know takut dia macam for sizes and all so
to macam
advise me on the sizing and then macam so what kind of design people is interested in
cause I don't have like banyak content cuma aku aku post apa yang aku ada dulu
tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya self bukannya orang beli then macam
sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku jer I don't know how to macam reach out to
because you know Instagram ada yang promote punya function tapi kena bayar aku tak ada duit dah lah aku tak
uh hobby punya expenses kan so ya
but tak ada duit so what's the things yang kau nak try
aku start pasal aku ada duit kan so aku the first step I did was aku beli mesin
that step I felt very macam alamak abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli ruler
but I I still have not macam masuk class atau macam any course yang will teach me
professional way ya so I think itu pun aku nak kena belajar so kalau if you want to join me
I think we can always join yang macam you know the SkillsFuture kind of thing
yang I saw at Instagram the one that you I send you that time then you were like uh but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
aku nak join the highest level the terus buat baju kurung that one you know
yang that time I was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
I think that one also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like macam after school uh part time I think we can join that
I mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents punya
ya aku pun rasa sama I think that's why I started my shop because I've been following so many macam kedai dorang semua sama like I don't know what I think I there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon ah they hyping all these kedai too much no offence
I saw one kedai dorang jual tote bag like
like basic gila tote bag dia abeh ada macam embroidery macam
macam pathetic ah to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out I'm like oh my god like I can do so much better
and some more kita kan daripada artistic punya course
ya that's why that's why um apa ni
that's why because because dekat Instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always kita selalu macam bilang you are artist you you gonna charge
punya harga mahal it's a piece of art it's a service people not tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu pe
so just charge lebih jangan jangan cause some more kalau kau charge low nanti other artist kena macam compare macam then the customer macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila
ya that one satu lah itu betul
apa ni benda-benda simple gitu
okay lah like I I guess rezeki dorang lah you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine atau machine just help you stitch atau
is it tulis letter punya atau
mm mm pasal my brother dia selalu buat commission work
so orang yang order dia punya commission work is like kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia
tapi dia pergi charge murah seh like A four
oil paint eh not oil acrylic punya paint they charge twenty dua puluh dua puluh dolar jer hello I'm
untuk dia senang lah memang untuk dia senang dia dia draw satu kali satu malam pun dah habis
so dia cakap tak akan aku nak charge mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap
benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang there's people out there yang charge benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau just macam
aku agaknya tak confident lah eh macam insecure macam aku nak jual tote bag aku berapa
macam mahal sangat kawan that kind of thinking you know
but ya so I think kita people like us kalau nak
buat benda-benda gini we should just do because we I don't think we have like necessary knowledge in macam style no offence
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing macam no offence like
like Instagram shops now locals semua macam they all have the same style
scrunchie ada banyak kedai scrunchie
pasal scrunchie senang nak buat
just uh just kain straight abeh kau tahu getah abeh jadi scrunchie ya
boleh lah
tak professional
but I like how macam sekarang punya Instagram shop is like a baru punya like a new platform to jual and you don't have to take rent right itu satu
macam kedai physical kedai ah tapi dorang pun aku follow a few kedai yang buat baju
so kau kau beli dia jahit dia tak jahit dia tak stock up
so kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu you can
baju ya I think that's very important
satu kali ni aku nak tidur abeh aku teringat eh I can't believe people throw around that that that term free size
apa kejadah tu free size
how can anybody have the same baju badan like kalau macam aku dengan kau kita bukannya
size jauh sangat tapi kau kan tinggi sikit
M S S tu pun macam okay at least you got like a few even though is like usually just S M and L
ya what about all those people yang tu macam kecil sangat atau besar sangat dorang kena dorang kena macam
apa ni grief give up sacrifice their style just for their size like very sad
which is like lagi mahal lah
ah tu pasal
lagipun sekarang macam kita our world or our like I don't know maybe people around us or my generation kan
kita more to macam a sustainable lifestyle
so banyak orang choose to beli
local atau secondhand atau thrift tapi
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand atau hand me down dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju kan kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal
itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam smaller than people so kalau banyak orang yang macam
besar sikit then macam mana dorang nak like
sustainable dorang nak macam oh macam long don't buy from fast fashion tapi actually fast fashion pun baju semua kecil lah tapi
ya that's why aku suka sangat dengan this new macam trend of kedai Instagram yang buat
custom fit is I think is very important I think kalau aku boleh jahit I think that's one of my goal macam
I like it's always at the back of my head to buka kedai baju lah actually tapi just I don't have the necessary
skill tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak seh aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai like yes
like yes the baju really is your baju it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your apa
your apa ni
and like lagipun baju yang tailor is always last longer
tahun pasal kan ada tag ada nombor tau and nombor dia belum nombor singapore yang
modern punya you know macam nine tu ya number dia lima or something like that how old is that ya
pasal pasal um
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting kan thrift is macam cheap murah
so kalau kau sustainable is when you buy something that already exists tapi macam at the same time
ah so you don't have to buat benda baru so it's not wasteful lah kirakan tapi kalau vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is mahal hundred dollars for a T-shirt for people apa seh T-shirt one hundred dollar tapi macam is
it got it got apa ni is valuable is got context ah there there's a history to it
uh uh abeh yang thrifting ni secondhand murah macam kat lucky plaza pasal is
people tak nak I feel like value a a a object is based on the
people nak ke tak nak is demand versus supply lah that's what makes the price
so ya I think kalau orang confuse I think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price kalau two dollar that's not vintage macam
oh ya lagipun
benda yang kita kena tanya ni actually kenapa baju sekarang murah
what makes it so like orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah
cause there's actually a cause behind that murah you know
until very sad that's why aku macam sekarang aku dah hundred percent
uh prevent myself daripada beli baju dari Uniqlo Cotton On
ya actually aku tak beli baju baru lah actually pasal
actually no offence tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju and baju kau semua lawa semua my size like I want to give people like I want to macam kasi kasi tapi alamak lawa pula pakai lah
abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar family aku dorang semua pakai baju kau sia
you give me I I wish orang lain pun ada this kind of macam relationship with friends atau macam macam
nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung kan dia orang kampung boleh gather baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil
dia kasi aku so aku selalu ada these people around me yang akan kasi baju but then I I don't think other people
so got a lot of people cause I some sometimes I ada orang tanya aku pasal this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get baju yang macam
bukan fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion tapi actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad tapi susah lah kan tapi ya I also don't have macam
much to say other than macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau tu jer
ye pasal kan actually kalau kau fikir fikir balik kan all this um wasteful punya life
cepat sangat is like so fast like it's sudden
macam actually kita yang boleh nampak lah the drastic changes actually dulu-dulu
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish lelaki dia nak create plastic bag pastu dia nak
dia nak he wants it to be a more sustainable uh alternative tau
dia tak nak pakai tree dia tak nak pakai paper bag pasal is from trees
abeh dia tak nak pakai macam cloth bag because it's uh to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is macam oh macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang
kita salah guna lah kita ada convenience kita buang after every use which is
crazy to me disposable how can satu benda kau buat susah-susah
terus kau buang plastic bag macam factory kena
lagi kalau kau belajar chemistry you know how all this thing is created daripada element dorang semua
kalau if you really look from the root kan kau macam oh my god I can't believe I throw that after one use you know
so going back to yang cakap pasal kedai Instagram and orang sekarang banyak buat benda
the uh it's a like bagus yang orang sekarang uh try their best untuk belajar all these skills balik buat apa ni
just buat benda-benda simple lah tapi at least dorang ada apa
ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini once you buat you akan
hargai you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
once you because we are so jauh daripada the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people kita tak
tak macam eh a'ah eh macam mana macam sayur sayur orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang
it's actually not our fault lah it's just how time has changed abeh macam tapi alhamdulilah kita dapat this
ilham this know in our head that we get to apa ni
belajar lah just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
we we can lagipun kita bukannya sustainably more aware jer I think we just more aware of everything
satu satu pending belum bayar
agaknya lah
is it lagi mahal dorang akan
macam kat mana-mana advertisement tu or what
explore page nanti ada keluar kan
explore page ada macam yang fashion
shopping all that tu kan
pasal actually ada satu dua orang tanya macam berapa gitu tapi dorang overseas then
actually I can I can ship overseas tapi dorang macam oh okay thank you pasal I I think they prefer to buy local lah obviously leceh kan
cause actually crochet kat singapore ada a few kedai crochet kat singapore you know the farah lola that one
ya that one but then it's like to me I don't really like singapore punya crochet punya
design design wise they more like for public friendly eh macam colour dorang macam
black grey tapi crochet it's still crochet but it's just like not as like my style lah
ya it's not like quirky ya pasal kat banyak seh kedai
macam banyak gila and it's all so cute and I like most of it I like inspired from from dorang ah
aku tengok dorang that's why aku nak macam I think that's a good thing about social media kau tengok alamak what am I doing so kau pun
lagipun kedai tu dia actually she used to work at kedai kain pastu pandemic kedai tu tutup
so dia selalu bawa balik kain yang dorang tak nak tau just scrap it's it's kirakan scrap tapi banyak lah
so dia bawa balik abeh dia collect over time abeh waktu pandemic ni dia jahit
dia jahit bag just simple bag it's all shoulder bag
lagipun dia dia baru graduate daripada university of textile or something like that ah
so I like her rezeki like so good lah pasal dia start baru waktu tu yang quarantine tu
abeh banyak orang beli habis tu sekarang all of her kain is dead stock
you know dead stock kain like no more like it's just orang tak nak macam she's already
her lining all recycled uh ah not recycled apa ni
cute she make it cute lah then the kain not that cute tapi she make it cute
abeh sekarang dia ada lagi satu size kau nampak
size dia panjang sikit sling dia abeh it's like big
ya alamak I think one day aku beli ah
tapi susah nak order tu dia drop terus kau kena order
pasal dia punya collection dia tak akan buat balik pe dia satu kali jer
aku pun nak buat gitu tapi kalau buat gitu then aku kena constantly come up with new things
kau tahu tak tapi kalau orang nak yang itu aku macam ah okay lah aku buatkan kau pasal I obviously I want money right
aku cuma buat aku tak tahu apa plan for my
aku pun nak buat gitu but then
aku punya followers tak banyak sekarang so
tu lah actually kau tahu farah lola kan dia punya design satu jer
cuma colour lain
so like everytime dia nak buat kan they just buat that thing and it's like how to say ah
design dia satu jer so kalau imagine
and she will drop that thing she will drop and say okay hari ni aku jual hari ni korang boleh pre-order
order that ah senang kalau kau punya design satu jer
so you can keep doing that same design so you can stock up lah kirakan aku nak made to order actually if can that's why it's a bit
so like that's why ya aku hundred percent will like
I don't know how long it can last tapi macam kalau ada kain it will be more durable
it will be more durable tapi kalau cardigan kan there's not much weight to it kau taruk kat badan kau pe tapi kalau bag kau letak botol
taruk botol tapi it will stretch ah eventually no matter how tight I make it you know
ya then macam quite fun lah because aku follow a few crochet punya kedai and they all so supportive they always share story of the design they like
then got this one kedai she daripada philippine then she say oh uh
uh reply this if you are kedai then I will promote what um the my my best the the my favourite post of you abeh since aku buat tu dia dia
post kat dia punya story abeh like a few crochet philippine punya account also quite cute ya
just happy to see orang singapore
creative so kita
ya even tengok orang pakai baju pun sedih I mean like bukan baju lawa tapi then macam err selipar pakai seluar pendek
tak boleh aku pet peeve ah
knit ke knit
kawan aku buat accounting punya course
sorry maths aku
kau interested dengan benda ni
actually aku nampak banyak job posting dekat job street about
ya I think kalau kau join kerja sekarang with that related job I think kau boleh start dari sana
like you don't have you don't really have to study like ya an alternative lah lagi kau hands on ah ya
arts arts kalau tak ada pandemic pun orang tak nak tapi the need for it lah
dorang ada tuesdays with morrie
abeh ah while the rest ada I don't know ah this city city got show I don't know what is it
I was supposed to uh kerja untuk hotel tau
you know hotels has the such a big show it's like the biggest show like selalu cakap kalau kau boleh kerja hotel kau boleh kerja apa-apa
production pasal is like four hours long like that then like the dresser is A and B you know
so kau ada shift so like oh my god aku takut lah waktu dia cakap ah you want to go hotel then I'm like yes but then I just yes cause I need job right
nasib baik tak ada tak tau nasib baik ke tak
kalau ya seram tapi kalau ya pun wah macam what an opportunity right ya
ya like hotel banyak gila cast then like all the cast is like
orh the third aku baru tengok crazy rich asians
okay lah cerita dia mm not my type lah
awkwafina pun vietnam eh ke korean
entah lah but they just take all and all kind of asian they can take in hollywood lah
okay lah I guess they we're going somewhere the representation tapi macam nampak force sikit ah
and this thing waktu tu aku dengan kakak aku adik aku macam heated heated argument
do we really want representation kalau representation gini macam hijab
macam okay kalau korang step macam diverse tapi macam there's not much
depth into that diversity just macam show off yang oh
show kita ni diverse then macam
some more like apa ni
if like if you kalau kau include orang pakai tudung like just example
kau tak payah taruk plot there something like culture what you don't have to keep like throwing to the audience like oh she's the muslim she's a she's a muslim like can you just like
talk about her like any other character macam okay macam do more about her personal punya character development whatever orh tak payah macam
cina jer cina jer ni martial arts
macam can you really you can just make a show cerita apa yang bagus
cerita ni a good place quite good ah good place
like they never even they never really macam
cause ada ni kan jamil is it is that what you call her
jameela apa nama dia the yang manny
ah nama dia jason jason ah yes
cerita tu tak payah macam force it's not force what but if if you really look at the cast macam quite diverse what
but that one tak macam oh
oh you know tak payah
cerita apa eh
it's bodoh
I saw someone I I saw a interview you know anthony padilla from smosh last time dia interview siapa perempuan tu yes
so dia ada buat porn pakai tudung abeh oh my god it's like so
macam how to say it's like very popular so it says a lot you know
oh my god sia I mean like it it's not kesian ah actually aku dengar interview dia sedih
dia buat sikit jer sia
dia cakap dia buat macam six video or whatever ah like macam ya
okay lah tu lain cerita ah
it's just perempuan dengan lelaki just different
no kalau kalau if you ever come across lelaki yang like like bothered by this
let's say he he he want to macam argue no lelaki pun but no don't even argue because
kalau kau bukan orang tu kalau kau bukan part of that
uh group you shouldn't be sort of defensive what kita bukan punya
kita bukan cakap yang kau kau pervert kau semua pervert bila masa cakap gitu
kita just cakap what's fact it's been decades since
macam tak payah cakap isn't it obvious macam adik aku sometimes gitu pasal adik aku dia
dia annoyed with modern feminism dia cakap
macam you know all this perempuan yang bogel kat street dekat lah all this but then you you shouldn't you shouldn't look at the at the
surface you shouldn't look at the surface tu apa dorang buat jer tapi you should really look at the cause the issue you know ni macam jauh sikit tapi aku nak compare pasal aku suka tupac kan
suddenly tapi banyak orang macam oh black people they are gangster cakap pun macam
pekik-pekik maki-maki each other tapi dia cakap dia there's there's one thing he say very like really got to me he say if you cannot
like the problem is dorang like how they even become like that you know

malay punya drama kahwin jer itu dorang punya conclusion eh kau tak nak kahwin nanti kau tak boleh kahwin itu jer
oh my god kahwin sia apa-apa problem kau ada kau kahwin
and kalau tak ada anak tu tak apa and like ni semua lain orang punya masalah lain tapi you should really look at the rezeki that you have
instead of we don't have I mean like memang manusia biasa kita selalu macam apa yang kita tak ada we really look

kena the hijab then later got stains all those germs mah so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always uh how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
but you make a promise what to meet her at two like I mean if you are going to be late you can always inform her lah like I'm going to be late so you can macam meet later or you can meet schedule another date ke apa then this one he make her wait
oh no wonder lah you keep messaging me want to go matchmaking cause you want to avoid that situation then I was like thinking why this girl always nak cari boyfriend lah cari husband then I'm like want to go matchmaking together I a bit segan lah
I know what you can do you can go to the mosque and find any imam and then say abang tolong saya
oh my god I feel I feel so weird right now you have so many interesting experiences with people who like you I don't have much but I think I have one story lah it was during my project so um my diploma we collaborated with like engineering students so we have to do like auditing at uh low income households kat yishun ah not really at yishun it's like canberra yishun area so um we were having a briefing and then I was like
and then he said uh can we exchange numbers cause you know for the uh final year project I was like okay lah I mean he's not like the main committee but I was like okay lah why not maybe at least can update him and stuff then after that from then right he keep messaging me on telegram on whatsapp and then during that period right uh what is that movie ah marvel is it not star wars apa movie tu yang viral
oh henry henry punya lagu
but do you still use that same email tak kan
actually I also like him actually he quite handsome remember that time you know you know but it doesn't mean that I like him okay remember that time in secondary school we were sitting like you were sitting in front of me then you sit beside justin then I was with rayson ingat tak
kau buat apa the whole day
then bila I dapat tahu yang dia akan cerai with dia punya uh isteri right
actually I don't know asal dorang break up ah eh asal dorang nak
cerai everything
at that point of time yang aku rasa macam wow he found the one
it was just berapa tahun yang lalu
and I rasa macam
kalau I Bella I pun maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
ya they got back together I think time bulan ramadan I think they got back together that which make me feel macam
don't ah jangan lah judge and everything then I was like oo okay
actually that time I terserempak dia then when I saw him right
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel kesian cause he looks very like
entah lah maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know ah dia kena tangkap pergi karaoke dengan like other girls
buat kot cause like
ya I mean no harm trying ah sebab if you tak try then you'll never know what
from ten to twelve I have like uh group consultation then from twelve onwards is um ten minute consultation with my professor then after that dah balik
no lah like I can balik but at the same time macam I got like macam this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
uh should be kat rumah lah cause sekolah like
ya no fast err there's only one halal malay stall which is ayam penyet
but it's okay lah cause like most of my classes dia online
so kalau online then I just
okay lah bila I first datang right
I feel a bit macam intimidated
asal you tak sabar I thought that
kalau you habis kerja then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
to have like a sense of security kat sana
ah cause I rasa lonely kat sekolah
macam cause most of kita nya classes online kan then dorang macam kita macam tak ada that common like bonding for us to make friends and ni ni semua
the example eh macam kau ada assignment due on week seven
dorang dah habis week
macam kanchiong habis
dorang actually kat sekarang
ah nama dia start with letter L
and dia punya kawan uh I think nama dia start letter B
you know I I nak beli baju daripada Shein you know Shein
I tak ada baju seh pergi sekolah
although I pergi sekolah dua hari jer every week
in your like situation memang susah nak save tau actually
for like kerja kan is just for you untuk
maybe one hundred you simpan
you know I rasa macam this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I rasa macam I've been a snorlax for so long
then sekarang macam
dah bangun kena kerja keras pula tu
you know I feel kan untuk present kita nak beli present untuk lelaki memang susah sebab
lelakinya present selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu because lelaki dorang macam very practical
cause eh I haven't finish cakap lah
okay then takpe kot
can buy him sabun
ya I mean if you want it easy then just baju eh then just uh perfume lah
uh I think it's okay it's just sometimes dia very busy
but at the same time I rasa dia boleh lah
takde lah I mean
that time he met Dakshah also sebab I tak free
huh I very like packed with a lot of things eh I got I struggling with school takde time ah
but it's really difficult to ajar him seh cause
parents dorang tak tahu tau yang actually macam mana nak handle budak-budak and everything
and then they just like feel yang cikgu yang akan
betul kan budak-budak punya pelajaran and stuff but
is very taxing penat seh
I ah boleh
ya I mean people always cakap alah jer pe
to secondary and secondary is like macam
I'm kind of thankful yang kita pergi a secondary school
yang not that macam
wah like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be seh
and all the mats and minahs and
the fact that they start smoking even during macam lower sec and doing a lot of other things
actually I scared seh sebab you know uh recently I nampak kat news kan macam
budak kecil right eh not budak kecil ah like just like lower secondary everything
dorang um they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase eh like it's damn
oh primary school pun
social media ah macam TikTok
and I just tak faham ah cause like I remember that time
err ada cikgu ni dia datang kat
me and then macam cakap lah like ah jangan buat malu keluarga ah jaga maruah keluarga
and then dia macam cakap ah macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua then I just feel that err they don't really understand
cause secondary school kan kita tak pernah lambat seh kita cuma lambat on the last day of school
Afif tak pernah lambat ah
dia pun lagi satu toxic nya orang dalam hidup
cause of her macam
ya I cannot seh dia seriously something wrong with her
I mean if you realize like those macam
there were like macam camne nak cakap eh
mm you know I rasa kan the best coach yang I ada right was actually my Singapore poly nya coach they were really like
and although I macam tak datang training atau I not that good kan dorang still never stop believing in me seh
and then dorang always cakap macam oh Ayra you can do this blah blah blah like that
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise kan actually tak healthy gila seh
flowers kenapa you ingat birthday I ke
I suka um
actually I suka mixed ah you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at macam
I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever nanti dorang letak dalam satu bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower yang macam yellow colour everything then you have like macam
blue colour of flowers and I and then macam ada purple sikit and then I rasa macam oh my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a macam
you know macam brown packaging gitu
oh actually kan I takut seh nak simpan flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday
ya that time bila I simpan flowers kan banyak cicak masuk bilik I seh
cicak lipas then flies
but you know ah I don't know if you pernah dengar there's this cafe called Antea Social
and then they sell like cakes ah oh my god bila I nampak I macam whoa macam sedap jer
macam nak pergi seh but confirm mahal
if I cannot like macam give birth or what right
I should be open to having anak angkat ah cause like
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel macam tak comfortable
ya I tak comfortable I think in a way because like
someone punya
kenapa would you consider
but would you nak would you simpan like cat or whatever pet
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can ah pelihara like
kucing when I dah besar but when I think about it right
I don't know seh it really depends ah whether I have time to jaga them or not
oh my god actually right last time I pergi rumah kawan I cause dia ada rabbit
and then like macam
dorang bising tau
I okay with zoo seh cause I feel yang macam
uh ya it's true ah yang dorang patut be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
oh my god adik I think you're thinking too much eh
cause like I mean it's a zoo what dorang confirm jaga punya
oh my god I nak pergi
a'ah angin
spa and like massage kat Singapore but mahal seh
ya you know I kena gigit dengan mosquito
dengue fever nya mosquito seh
berapa ah dia buat
oh my god I nak buat my gigi juga seh
I takut dentist marah I though
cause I tak jaga my teeth
I makan chocolate lah makan apa lah
eh you know kalau you tengok like advertisement everything right they always have like
uh toothpaste right like banyak gila right actually by right it's too much seh actually it's just supposed to be like macam one thin layer on your toothbrush and that is enough
then macam
tak lah tu group member lain lah you tak dengar betul eh
like like I see like ramai orang macam
they just keep it in you know and lambat laun it will be very bad for them
so you pergi yang mana satu
northpoint asal you nak gi northpoint eh
oh ya I scared you tired seh besok you kerja so maybe you just take J cube
tapi I nak bawa
cause uh I think kat rumah
mentos um you know yang the
ah I not sure but I know dia cuma ada apa eh
kita boleh like
eh I suka seh curtain you
a'ah eh tapi your aircon seram seh dia tengok macam ada dua mata tengok
eh actually kan I tempted nak pergi funan mall seh besok sebab I nak beli cookie
maybe cause I nak cookie
a'ah I boleh pakai student
tapi I I belum um
I belum send lagi
I belum buat uh student pass
tak ah tak student price ah
macam my kerja all macam eh my classes all macam habis pukul enam right
so I takde time nak pergi
ya that time I nampak my bank kan dorang minus
macam sixteen dollars per week you know
and it doesn't help cause like my way of commuting is uh to naik bus what then bus selalu ada macam they take the longer route what so that's why ah
um means ada ke tak ah
wow mahal pe
which really makes me feel like macam oh my god to work really hard
kenapa seh
some of it is very very small leh then I tak suka seh
I don't like to feel macam claustrophobic seh
a'ah seh I nampak then I was like why
ya I nak seh but like hello helicopter for what
ya I'm awake kenapa
I know kita kena buat sampai enam puluh seh
okay bagus
no I ada cakap dengan you I just
no that time I bilang you dah enam puluh
why is it ah he like macam affected cause you you cakap kenapa tak berbual melayu dengan dia
oh why that day you rabak is it or what
mesti dia macam I remember dah penat
I mean I rasa
buat orang penat and like ya
I think it's good lah yang you all just
I think out of all the people you know right like how much I love to use SIRI every like every err err everything that we want to search on google I'm always hey SIRI and dorang tak faham like dorang selalu macam give me some weird err weird like response
I macam malas nak taip okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life tapi it's like double job ah I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it tapi you you yang selalu macam
for their day to day like everything is SIRI seh because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more macam how do I say like err they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI macam everything tak boleh
kita just tak kaya lah kita tak kaya
ya so if my phone can actually macam faham what I'm saying from time to time it would be nice lah I would I would appreciate it a lot lah
ah okay okay let's think of a scenario okay maybe raya raya kita pergi rumah dorang
okay salam hey selamat hari raya selamat hari raya
oh I makcik I I yang makcik eh wah okay
okay okay you makcik you makcik
you pakcik okay okay you pakcik you pakcik okay
okay okay kita buka eh hello selamat hari raya
baik dari rumah pak ngah punya
tak okay okay jer okay oh sejuk sangat
oh okay lah so pakcik tu akan cakap err hey SIRI make it hotter
kan yes it like that always happens like what's the point lah honestly I tak tahu lah what
I hope dorang macam it's it doesn't become like one of those err you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy eh okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he err macam fell in love with the so macam because the became dia punya kawan like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels paling faham like paling understanding
something like that like so dia macam
very err macam
existential crisis kind of thing macam oh no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
it is kind of cool lah actually macam
it in this recording he said that tak tak dengar
I cuma dengar
no okay let's not let's be good citizens but anyway macam ah I think it's a good thing what he did only because like he made use make good use of the time you know of a bad situation he made it into a good one and
um like you macam lupa life before COVID mana concert err err indoor stadium ada
err you know what's weird like err I've been to concerts dekat big box and I feel ya
err err don't know but I think it's like the third or fourth level something like that and then dia macam um it's like a big
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is err like standing and I think it's weird because macam
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there tapi macam to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to jurong so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like err a bit more macam authentic singapore but
like weird lah to have a concert there cause it's like sebelah dia is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop tempat makan I guess macam what
it's like you ya you have to buat research dulu ah like you cannot straightaway
is it in the the food court or is it like macam like tempat makan on its own
oh oh like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much dekat sana is
the naan oh my god the indian food dia punya naan is I think two dollar fifty and sedap gila and like the dia punya ah butter chicken macam tak tak ah lokek super sedap
I know macam dengar you punya mulut macam berair liur macam you know
not for more than just satu occasion ya
oh okay pasal like it's every macam not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all kurtas are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
and mahal gila like kita pula dia
oh murahnya you shouldn't gotten that one
okay kedai apa because I pernah makan dekat tekka punya market and there's a certain stall yang sedap also like it's not bad
is it dekat entrance you know there's the bus stop
I menang seh
ya so I macam very competitive
and like macam you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I boleh I akan menang lah but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
mm like honestly same to me macam I'm not really surrounded with people yang
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends dorang like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature yang dorang not the most err not say friendly not the most social macam
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly betul-betul ya err before that I tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main monopoly deal also I tak tahu main
this is the thing okay the only thing I played eh a board games macam betul-betulnya board games macam meaning you are the board macam not card games or whatever first okay kita just board games was the game of life
I I think masih ada kat rumah but I have to find it
okay everyone will start at a point where okay kau nak belajar ke kau nak
ah start kerja straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions ah that will make you ponder about what to do next tapi dia macam fast forward gila ah sebab after maybe a few turns you dah graduate lah err then for those yang macam dah start kerja after a few turns towards the ending you dah ada anak you know you dah get married you dah ada anak so it's like it's very fast tapi it's quite fun err so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know macam introduced me to board games and shit oops sorry err introduced me to board games eh I wanted to ah bring that board games to
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me macam snake naik atas ke turun I don't know ah ladders boleh turun ke naik atas you know like I don't know which one is which err I don't know proper dice rules also macam err you know like if you um)(ppo get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think cuma ada satu dice satu die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends um but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
dia macam aeroplane eh ya I I ingat and I think I rasa I rasa I pernah main juga but I tak pernah
like research how to main betul-betul ya
like kita lend or macam like kita will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
it's the one yang you cannot move the thing right
whatever it is okay lah some people will think strategically dorang nak amek the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it eh all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this dah one hand and then dorang just lepaskan that's it
I think is I think as many I don't know lah but like only one person have to do that and then dia lepaskan kan so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one lah
ya which is okay tapi sometimes even the one at the top can tergoyangkan yang the other one
okay I tahu about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like macam is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
for a moment I macam
in my whole life I tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa so kenapa I cakap tu dekat you I tak tahu main chapteh no err I I think I'm pretty bad at chapteh err for people who can play what's that called yang the sepak takraw I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you pakai kaki like flick the thing up like I think sepak takraw is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play sepak takraw
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I tak tahu kalau the rules betul ke tak completely tapi basically like ah I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay congkak gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
kita ada this one corner
macam kampung-kampung eh like but okay
err with the steps as well like it was like err I don't know how to explain ah okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you tengah naik atas the ya to the to the macam what's that call like a patio luar the kampung like outside part of the house
okay ya the serambi and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets ah like shelves of games you can play so congkak was one of them
like something similar right okay lah dah tak special
so oh that one also macam macam eraser
err I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country punya flags ah
oh ya it's always like the hardest to find eh singapore err but I never had singapore punya flag
oh wow apa tu it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
um and hopefully it will happen lah but till then macam it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a macam okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
mm cause I think err macam uh in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
no like err macam I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe macam the planning lah planning maybe boleh
but macam kalau I nak buat sekarang execute everything sekarang I don't think I can yet
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you lah someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that macam kita dah discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
um tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her macam err buka her own ah no no not buka ah she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated dengan this satu sunglasses company
ah like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but err that's not my macam
a household name like okay like macam everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
such a global phenomenon macam and it's because kan like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right tapi the way she did it eh because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was macam err
macam maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain um products that are not the most friendliest to macam that kind of skin tone
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business macam like it really
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life macam I dah tak payah kerja dekat office I
dah macam my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries dah tak ada and all I can focus on is my business
but it's more of a personal thing it's not macam the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns macam to get return customers maybe that's one way of like um success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that ah
hundred K you nak tahu tak kenapa I tanya tu sebab kat instagram I wish I wish tak lah but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so kalau you boleh faham you boleh try to explain to me ah so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall eh kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the ah kourtney kardashian punya
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like err the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was um answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase kan like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people punya accounts tapi the moment the giveaway is done orang akan unfollow ah
but it's just that like kalau orang tu terlupa then maybe the account is still there
okay so lepas ni semua orang so seventy K plus like all the bags tau plus tau it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from
so it's like it's cool lah macam you menang you menang you tak menang you tak menang ah so I ask you that because I macam if I really menang what am I going to do like
it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so macam and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states ah florida or something it's not me ah they they said the results on friday I checked tak ada notification ya but ya like so um
I I think singapore quite mahal lah like
because the bags were different sizes macam there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
okay seorang wanita yang suka
oh okay bag bag beg-beg apa what's like the
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something macam my mum works at coach gitu ah then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I macam okay I got to humble down but no but basically like um I haven't heard lah ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I ni tak pernah masuk macam
sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah and very judgemental
err I don't know man I don't know dia punya price list seh like I think satu handbag eh
I tak tahu like
empat ribu probably gets you the small zip hmm probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I tak tahu I tak pernah so
just macam whether or not you'll be mm
I tak ingat sangat tapi
cause okay the only reason why I betuk-betul tahu there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the err the doctor from
no no cause macam the people who listening to this probably dorang biol like you know
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor punya salutation that's given it's not medical
I understand macam it's not something kita um
like something we want ah basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable kalau like you tak tahu the only reason I tahu is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it kalau I don't I don't know mm
apa kita tahu is just main game
ya kita nak main monopoly after this actually
sorry kita curse banyak seh
tapi I trust you lah don't worry about that oh
okay err in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that macam that is a plus point lah
err kentang the way I say it kentang goreng kentang kentang kentang okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately sebab to me macam a bit
in terms of food but we'll why because kalau dah nak keluar makan
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a tempat will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya ayam err ikan semua okay err so ya I think it's still pretty okay
just that andes andes sedap gila and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but kita actually dengar waiter cakap andes so
so macam usually if I go through anything that's not
so it like macam it reduces that err
that is not a good thing also jangan berhutang-hutang orang
tetapi err what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and macam really support you in times of need yes
macam mm there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
orh oh I'm sorry baru entah baru balik dari ni tadi baru balik dari clinic
err so far okay jer macam better better
ya it's better it's way better but sometimes I do have my chest pain macam sakit dada like sometimes dia very hard to breathe you know
but the doctor then gave me um apa inhaler
ya so inhaler okay lah pakai okay jer
when whenever I have that pain but now for now no lah takde pun
I asked my friend yang ada asthma and then I was like wait jap I actually post a status dekat Whatsapp
err ya that and then I forgot that my my close friend ada asthma then I quickly Whatsapp her and then dia cakap uh ah dia explain lah one by one and then I oof lega better but the chest pain is still there you know cuma macam tak dia masih boleh bernafas clearly lah ah
mm mm ya macam very hard ya allah serious
mm sebenarnya actually when you have prolonged cough for two weeks more than two weeks kau kena pergi clinic I mean kalau it's less than two weeks okay you have nothing to worry about lah kalau macam lebih and then macam tu kau kena pergi check
ah kira then
oh faham faham faham
kicap is good man you're missing sumpah
kenapa kejap kenapa kau tak boleh makan yogurt
yogurt is yeast ke
oh wait aku sumpah baru faham

then after that actually actually was abang lukman wanted to go to puncak to eat and then he actually told me kita cycle lah but then I say you gila ke because my bicycle is like macam
half can make it half cannot because that time ah we cycle all over and then my bicycle chain just terkeluar
then I panic ah then oh oh my god okay nasib baik abang lukman ada ah
then hari tu that day she suddenly ibu dekat luar pintu then like then after that thank god I baru habis mandi tau so I just open door
then it ibu dan ayah masuk ah and then ibu layan ayah to go for cycling then because ibu and ayah they are waiting then abang lukman just
then just say abang dengan ayah dekat luar kita pergi cycle lah tak baik macam cause we bunga ayah that time jauh pe naik
then he say oh my god K fine then we go so bila I pergi tu
um okay the thing is abang lukman belajar kan dia tidur pukul macam semalam pukul tiga empat pagi
no dia yang belajar and kakak tidur dia orang sembilan dah dah boleh bangkit and do his
I pukul sebelas pun macam macam kena langgar lori
pukul err sebelas setengah begitu
ya at first and then but then have to wait cause abang lukman berak lama
like thirty minutes later then abang lukman keluar then err we siap-siap and then we go but then I in in macam that chaos and that excitement I terlupa nak err makan breakfast
so I cycle all the way ah daripada sini terus sampai faiz and it was okay I was okay sampai dekat faiz the moment I stand up
uh darah keluar and then after I'm like oh my god terus macam kakak punya ini macam diri macam nak pengsan
then after that um habis tiba-tiba kakak punya vision macam half ah oh my god it was the worst and I thought cause macam overheated panas habis tak makan I a bit uzur
and then after that ah we balik ayah dengan ibu continue to marina bridge
lepas tu balik daripada tu um like kakak pengsan gila macam even bila dah habis makan right
when we were sitting there I am so exhausted like halfway through when dekat yang dekat faiz tu at the caldecott there's like a small
tak boleh cycle I can't like kakak macam terhuyung-hayang and I so panas so I took the air botol and then I pour my
ah macam just just basah and then and then because I cycle and then I wear serkup cause normally I cycle I no wear serkup but cause got ibu mah later ibu scold me
aiya so I wear serkup ah
it's the damn serkup
tapi tak lawa nanti macam pakcik err a'ah
habis macam bawah lawa cause I was wearing my what's that exam T shirt and the nice pant tiba-tiba atas macam kepala sotong
and then kalau masuk mall you have to open mah
your sun hat kirakan macam gila pe sebab I muka nampak apa cause like bulat
tau kalau you that macam muka macam ada mix sikit lawa ah maybe it's acceptable
but our our asian features are just you know ya we can't rock those like macam turban look
I think we have like face feature our face feature macam like for example macam we small like small face and then we have high cheekbone
have high yours and mine is the same what high cheekbones right it's only your hidung besar
so you should press it because last time you always listen to kakak aimah kakak aimah don't like
ah hidung mancung cause he say cause he say hidung tinggi nanti sombong like literally peribahasa hidung tinggi then I was like what the hell
ya so he she always penyek then you always macam hidung kata you just like okay ya ya like that
abang long shape his nose
it's like those like macam perfect macam mancung habis kat sini macam ada sikit habis macam lawa for an
ah for an asian guy so and then because I also ibu also always like you know ibu hidung mancung ah cause atuk is like indian or whatsoever
ah ya whatever so ibu got that hidung mancung mah
then ibu always say hidung hidung penyek cause follow ayah mah so serious I always like picit my hidung cause I want
um hidung mancung then after that I always thought my hidung was big
macam I don't know like macam because like orang keep on saying macam ibu keep on saying hidung besar hidung besar so
so ya lah you tahu when hidung bawang macam bawang bawang gila
bawang ah ya
macam nek onah eh bukan eh nenek
ah ya atuk jer macam handsome kan
I mean uncle zair tak tahu kalau handsome time muda
ah macam okay macam kak mira dengan amsyar
dekat nur and eh ah nur and
so then after that I tak nanti I think I met abang lukman abang lukman say I got small nose
like one of the small nose and like quite mancung for a malay lah then I was like oh I didn't know that
ya but it's still considered small tengok macam tak
apa mermaid man
but then it's like kecil then oh it's actually small and then when now when I look at the mirror
oh it's actually average looking nose it's not that bad you know like what you picture cause I last time I always thought I gemuk
exactly because ayah ayah keep on saying uh
uh gemuk gemuk jangan makan nanti gemuk faham tak so it's like macam daripada kecil you have that body yang gemuk but then padahal you tak cukup makan
ya it's not the normal beras apa
and then aku tak tahu sekarang tapi
tapi macam kakak rasa sekarang kadang-kadang macam I can do it
then bila I stayed at his parents I timbang I was forty nine
lepas tu it was just like
then I I don't know how if I have fluctuate cause kat sana makanan banyak sekarang di sini kita makanan independent so macam
on let's say makan macam sikit sikit kurang sikit
mm kat dekat rumah serangoon last time banyak gila makanan
maybe like don't have plan but maybe dia mak and ayah use car
tak happy eh tapi kan ada minimum
tapi yes mah eh bapa dia nampak demam sikit
masa tu habis masa dah tak ada so semua ni lepas tu tukar jadi babat
habis that day I I took photo and then I send to his ayah lah then I cakap makin tembam budak ni
a'ah habis apa ayam ayam ayam everything ayam kalau tak ada ayam daging
mesti pun hantu ayam because kalau kakak beli macam daging ke atau apa kalau kak masak kakak makan sikit so macam bazir so might as well I cook whatever he wants to eat which is
sahaja luckily your face don't turn into chicken
um habis but then you skin will be saggy
kentang chicken
ya aiya kau ni mahal mahal juga aiya tak tahu nenek cakap satu meal berapa tau beberapa keping ayam
adik tahu satu packet um ayam satu packet ayam berapa satu packet ayam dua paling murah is seven dollar forty five cent
dia lepas tu tanya dia berapa banyak berapa banyak pieces tu ah boleh dapat thirty six
ah separated kalau is thirty six wings chicken drumsticks dengan wing atau lapan belas set of drumstick that is how much tau
itu kalau one week adik makan six kan adik boleh tahan selama three
tapi still mahal you tahu semalam yang kan tangan dimakan tu kau tahu itu berapa
ah sebab bersih sangat mampus kan
I thing is ah I think ah ayah dan ibu even the chicken I mean ah sorry it's not that nice
macam what is the flavour
no she's good at cooking but she like masak but she don't like to taste her food
ah is abang home already
sebab because living room itu baru if you make dekat tu also so it's nicer for him whereas the bilik kan macam dah tunggang pecah if you understand
in the point of macam healing kan it's so much better to be in a clean and newer environment rather than macam old you understand
kena buat partition lah ayah kena panggil buat partition
buat lah partition
that house that house is so big it has so many potential tapi macam
ah recognise or macam ayah eh ayah ayah dah tak kuasa nak keluarkan duit untuk renovate and then ibu pula malas nak maintain so macam oh my god
macam they they put the effort to
cause ayah will start something and then he he will expect ibu to follow up with it
macam dah lapuk is so outdated already I think twenty years it was okay but now it's
why so degil one ah
ya can you imagine kalau rumah aku buat ambin dalam bilik tu nah
kadang-kadang nak buat ambin tapi nak buat yang macam japanese style
ah ya ya ya macam lawa macam just like platform it doesn't need to be a permanent just you can buy the platform is have that one then you just put your bed on top I think quite nice eh macam those
oh is it but you baring if you put your
tilam only if you put your tilam ah
the bawah is literally err
err apa ni like err literally like that tapi tak rasa
you don't feel it ah the only thing bad about that thing right they literally macam blew the papan onto the floor
so kalau macam in the future kalau nak macam shift shift but you can't shift it is like that
but I love a lot of things about japan especially macam dia orang
macam kecil macam dia orang punya design of barang macam macam kecil and it's so efficient in my opinion
so kakak cakap suka gila that time when we went to
kyoto ah then there's daiso a huge ass daiso and then beside it there was like a furniture kedai perabot
I think they literally jual macam one set macam sinki yang ni dan dia punya
cabinet atas dengan cabinet bawah dengan lampu dia dengan dia punya segala-gala lah dia punya there is literally one unit
and boleh masuk bathtub
can you imagine how amazing that is that's like this this this toilet ah macam bodoh sia
why can't they put the jamban and the sink side by side then we have a long ass
jamban just put together right oh my god
why they never think about it I don't know how they design it is so like so bodoh like even the tingkap this one ah
ni kan kalau rumah lama is dekat atas pe
this like for example kalau macam hujan but then you still want air ventilation you can open up the top windows mah then get air in
this one you open you can open the first one on top if you open the below air hujan masuk it's like so bodoh I don't know what are they thinking when designing the house
tapi ini macam bodoh macam bodoh gila
rumah juan yang dekat uh uh huh
macam lawa macam it looks like a bedroom macam ni it looks like a fucking bedroom right no fucking storeroom I don't know it's so weird
the jemuran eh
they don't even know what is inside the kotak right
ah ya but like I think if you wanna buy your furniture macam tu if ikea stuff don't buy on the kedai itself pergi carousell
jual and then jual dia harga macam murah gila babi yang itu macam apa seh dining table dua puluh aku beli dua ratus
so macam geram gila macam ini set alarm right um we bought this two hundred and forty
ah macam banyak
ya kau macam eh sakitnya hati ya allah ya
so macam tak perlu seh I mean like the thing macam almari ni seven hundred whereas we can actually bought it at
brand new lagi just have to fucking dismantle it and it is still very cheaper than buying a
itunya macam menyesal so kadang-kadang kan just buy from carousell
I mean yang paling biasa I carousell kadang-kadang dia ada kasih dengan free items eh
apa add on
tak free stuff macam orang kasih free orang nak macam just siapa-siapa nak ambil free ah macam give away
what tu apa
call of duty ini pasal apa eh
kita gaduh anyway macam mana dengan awak um

tak besar actually initially saya nak saya nak belikan briyani tau
pasal apa tau dia orang punya dia orang catering tak boleh masak sendirikan so dia orang catering
habis kita dua-dua orang masak macam dia orang punya lunch caterer tu all tu masak pukul berapa tak
pukul sepuluh malam caterer tu start masak
habis pernah satu kali tu dia orang macam dia orang gunakan psychology sia kat I
lepas I nak kena korek lima lima lima lubang
sebelum lunch
dia orang cuma sempat did I tell you the story
so that day nak kena korek lima lubang sebelum lunch
habis err dia cuma boleh korek dua dua lubang
err so then after that dah masuk waktu dah eleven forty five dia orang punya lunch kat sana pukul dua belas tau
so then dah macam eleven forty five habis tu dia orang just start packing packing tau habis tu saya cakap silent kan ah
silent kan silent kan habis lepas tu err dia orang cakap
uh okay err I cakap dia orang baik-baik ah I cakap
err can you all finish this lubang first then after that go makan lah can or not
lepas tu dia orang macam cakap lah dengan saya
err can right ya like you quickly collate lubang ah five only as in three more then after that
then you makan ah but later sister ah this one catering cooking ah night time cooking now now later spoil lah cannot eat already sister wasting money dia cakap begitu
habis instruction datang daripada jane suruh lubang sebelum lunch
habis kat sini pula the guy cakap kalau makan lambat nanti makanan rosak
aku macam alamak ini macam mana eh I tengok adilah dia cakap

K tak apa aku just aku take the fault lah tak apa tak apa
never mind you go you go you go clean clean clean barang all then just go just go pergi makan
tapi at the end of the day ada mula ada orang macam question
so macam kesian lah so I thought like
how ah you all like monthly ah dia cakap memang monthly pasal dia orang dia orang yang nak kena bayar sendiri
err company ada bayarkan
habis dah lama-lama kan I think the company also feel the pinch kan
so dia orang catering masak sendiri so as in the caterer ah
yang dia orang order ini masak daripada pukul sepuluh and then dia orang makan dua belas
pasal ah caterer dia macam
for macam banyak apa
habis tak tahan lama ah begitu macam kesian seh

A level mana ada civil

so pergi or I or I pergi
ada orang kita tahu ke do we know anyone in the
nama saya nadi
enam tahun whoa
ada contract
jadi sudah sudah tujuh eh enam tahun
dah enam tahun wow
lagi satu tahun tengok lah macam mana
ya betul betul betul
mengidam eh
pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan or the bunny chow tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba it's a whole loaf of bread
ya ya and it was recommended ramai orang suruh order
ah cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu so kita orang saja lah tanya-tanya eh apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah try ini semua
terus err
apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh try bunny chow terus ada satu customer pun suruh kita orang try bunny chow
terus kita orang try ah ya ingat tak the customer
terus wah it it was the best decision we've ever made
ya kita nak makan banyak kira you know pros and cons kena give give in ya oof
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that sebelum tu kita orang try ah McDonald's
then saja saja
saja nak try tengok country apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya ah McDonald's
tapi tak tak sedap sangat lah singapore punya standard terlalu tinggi saya rasa
a'ah I I boleh boleh rasa yang ini
ah ye ye ye ye ye
jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni plus kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada community melayu juga
uh jadi kita ingatkan
walaupun err the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
makanan mesti ada mesti ada ah sedikit ah yang sama kan
oh okay I remember ada samosa
ye ke lupa ah oh okay interesting I forgot my memory not good
dah dah dua dua tahun eh
err practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was apa eh
oh oh I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was daging and there was cheese it was
it was oh it was basically like roti john but they throw in uh fries also so ya and sayur also so it was like a whole meal with a
dengan ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch
ya dalam lima minit tiba-tiba makanan dia dah sejuk kan
a'ah tak boleh taruk tepi pun kan
mmhmm pasal ice box<malay>dia ice box dia share nanti takut orang curi kan ya
lepas tu we also didn't want to throw I remember
oh wow tu semua pahadal dah lupa seh now all the memories are like coming back
eat like they didn't have much to eat jadi apa dorang buat is apa-apa dorang boleh dapat all the ingredients bahan-bahan dorang ambil taruk dalam roti terus makan jer
sedap but it was like a it was an experience lah it was really just all at once ya
gila weren't didn't think properly lah basically
mmhmm okay juga
kita orang tak tak bersedia at all ya
terus macam kita orang tengok atas kalau kita tengok atas tengok macam puncak dia masih tak sampai-sampai ah masih jauh lagi dalam hati ke
a'ah lepas tu oh yang yang saya masih ingat is a
on the way up ada satu orang orang ni tengah lari tengah buat morning exercise dia dia tengah bersukan lari naik turun gunung
jadi kita orang fikir eh ni ni agaknya masih masih
masih okay lah agaknya akan sampai lah siapa yang lari naik turun gunung eh
jadi kita orang ah tak jauh mesti tak jauh terus ingat dia ada anjing sekali ikut dia
saya ingat saya fikir dalam hati okay mesti dekat mesti dekat jadi continue naik ke atas continue naik
ah ada tempat duduk
ah dah naik a'ah
dua jam mak ah
ah eh tapi masa dia punya dia punya apa
ah permandangan cantik lepas tu
pun it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
a'ah tu tu lah tu lah
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit
terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba ah angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari eh
a'ah memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa mountain gear tu semua ada yang stick panjang tu ah hiking stick dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja jer jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu
and we just rest and reflect apa kita orang buat tadi
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like ah tak puas cause like
cause I was really curious I actually tengok ah video signal hill macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas grass semua okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
I got I got jio one friend she she also malay okay we all melayu together
lepas tu we could have like walk down almost tour you know
ah gi jalan-jalan
uh uh I remember uh ada makan makanan macam fish and chips
that time kau rasa
like aku masih ingat like for for the trip was mostly the experience and I feel like the
the activities dengan kawan-kawan pasal ah I ingat dalam kita orang naik van lepas tu ada tiga van ada tiga van four is it ah ada empat van dalam satu van ada dalam tujuh atau sepuluh orang
gitu going through puberty
dengan ya kita orang dengan a few other singaporeans right I remember
ah dorang gaduh
ah kita orang walaupun ah
aku ingat ada berapa orang dalam van tak suka budak ni tapi walaupun kita tak suka kita masih baik kita orang tak tak ada dengki ke apa kita cuma
so we we sort of came to consensus that we kita orang akan bersama dalam berapa
trip tu berapa hari ye
ya one week kita orang came up with a consensus we will be together for one week so we should we should get along so even we don't like this boy we try to we try to you know make this
ya he also seem to enjoy it and I know he's aware that a lot of people don't like him lah jadi macam kesian sikit juga lah
okay lah dia minta gambar tak apa
hantar jer
okay to be fair budak tu kalau kita orang kalau kita punya kayak sebelah dia dia akan
dia akan tolak atau dia akan splash water ah lepas tu
ah I ingat that ah I have a fear of uh the sea
so that was not helpful whenever he tolak my my kayak
macam mana nak lukis just bukan lukis saja-saja tau macam lukis macam macam artist gitu
macam boleh dapat kerja like macam graphic design ah
okay pasal adik saya seorang artist jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang
macam uh swimming
at this bridge bridge dia is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
the um tahun lalu I went to krabi dengan kawan krabi okay
like I will be responsible for that jadi jadi I remember after that I
like dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
tak no it was it was it was already like
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes pasal dia punya air air dia clear kan
banana boat ada tu ada lah but
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is kita orang dua bukan orang kayak
and then I remember okay mula-mula there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care lah too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
there's certain places you can kayak right kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar lah but anyway gi kayak dekat
ah tahu tapi kawan-kawan I semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat marina barrage ada kat lakeside pun padahal ada
ya I I actually uh baru belajar macam mana nak float masa kat krabi because err
I suruh ya I suruh kawan saya ah ajar macam untuk sorry lah eh vishu teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
good enough okay jaga diri sendiri
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me ah nadirah jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal
kalau tak nanti ah nanti penat pengsan kau dah lah selalu pengsan kau jangan
ya bawa gula bawa apa protein bar ke apa
I'm like aww tak aku tak bawa
aku terus lupa cause naturally
on the way up cause okay naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari
dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu ah
kita orang ada bayar guide lah untuk bawa kita orang ke atas
lepas tu dorang ada ah ada tempat-tempat tidur
macam this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga kan kita orang lah dua hari naik turun naik eh naik ada
kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal time tu macam june june daerah kita orang daerah southeast asia kan monsoon season kan ah ah terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena stop apa semua and then I remember there were certain point where
ya then she did that but then I remember macam the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
ah dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang
like lima belas twenty
it's like if you there you see the statue is like besar gila so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
ya I don't know I just find it interesting lah but ya lah then I remember after the trip we basically we kita orang tour from the north
the city dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu and just get moving down down down all the way to ho chi minh kind of thing
no lah no me and vishu are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very kasar like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then ah after that err
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her lah ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them lah but agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask oh kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip bukan holiday holiday tau the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know ah like you cannot be too luxurious lah dia macam too suspicious
that kind of thing terus aku ajar naik motor cause aku boleh naik motor kan terus dia kata ah tapi ah kalau orang catch kita orang tak ada license macam mana terus aku macam
siapa nak catch kau sia
ya aku realised just okay siapa nak catch kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku lah apa-apa jadi aku ada license then I was like apa sia kau takut banyak
sana punya orang punya license pun a'ah dorangnya license pun questionable kan
lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
like eh ah oh terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang vietnam jadi dia based her own experience dari situ dia kata kakak I kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia survey seratus orang boleh lah aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia kan satu orang
dia bukan cabut dia macam okay
a'ah plan dia memang until that time jadi ah pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu chill aku dengan dia kita orang jadi good friends terus habis tu ah dia halfway through kena pergi laos
untuk internship
ah kita kena fikir
kita orang kena calculate you know kat depan tu
a'ah tu lah dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi tapi dengar jer ikut jer ya
aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu ah jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi laos untuk internship
and then lagi satu perempuan tu ah yang masalah sikit dia padahal free tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia err visitor sorry dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana lah dia dah decide yang okay
since budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi ah jadi jadi macam gitu lah
ah tak payah lama-lama lah okay lah that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya tak payah there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her lah ya
ya banyak tempat
boleh lah dalam masa depan
I nak minum hot chocolate dulu
okay so kita memang dah tak
meat products as much as we did before I mean dua ribu dua belas eh dua ribu dua puluh dah kind of okay
so how how far lang nak go in to into veganism
I rasa
tapi in a way I think we're almost
I rasa
tapi I rasa I macam ada
selfishness sebab I don't
feel the same thing bila macam guna ikan bilis just because they are smaller than a chicken or lembu
ah I rasa selfish sebab they should be equal
ya ya ya faham mukbang
a'ah in a way lah sebab
I mean orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing is our companion pet banyak orang guna sebagai ah ada anjing as pet
manja lah binatang tu can be so is that the same comparison
tapi kita start dengan err hunting and gathering food from ah natural resource macam
dia pergi memburu semua kan then baru come this era bila orang start berkebun and jumpa teknik berkebun
wah I tak ingat
jadi kalau you nak go into veganism you akan
be a vegan lah bukan vegetarian
telur I cannot leave that I mean I
I boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu but I feel like I need my protein daripada telur
tapi the challenge
ah you I tak sure tapi I
the challenge will come bila balik rumah mama
masak apa yang dia masak lah I don't think I have the strength to tolak
because it's not something yang I boleh dapat every day
I I can do that kalau pergi kedai kawan
tapi kalau balik rumah family dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan
but I myself don't have the strength to tolak apa yang dah ada tu ah
ah and sebab I tahu
so susah ah
you macam mana
apa yang spark your idea untuk
err timeline ke
yang membuat you sampai ke part yang mana you nak jadi vegan ni ada cerita dia ke
macam cringe cringey
I rasa
yang betul-betul macam the moment yang spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
and because of a lot of things eh yang you bagi tau I lah and dia macam I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan kan sebab we have abundant soy sauce we have that err we have abundant soy derived products macam tempeh tauhu
mm sedap jer
ya lah sebab kita crave
spread penyakit ke macam nyamuk you you never know which one yang gigit you yang bawa aedes
extreme lah I mean I I think dua hari lepas kot I kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi
selain delving into veganism apa you punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu
kalau ada lah
I think ada kot
I rasa I rasa I punya azam tahun ni I nak
sebab I dah lama sangat tinggalkan drawing and sekarang I rasa janggal nak buat the kind of drawing yang I pernah buat dulu
janggal gila sampai sampai macam halfway tu dah menyampah tau
tapi tapi I I tau lah kalau kalau practise every day
dia makin lama makin okay so that's one of my
lepas tu I nak
belajar italian
and probably greek as well sebab tu pun dah tinggal quite lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu
um apa lagi eh
I wish I can say yang I nak seriously
belajar music but
but quit susah lah sebab I I don't have the same passion untuk tahu what's behind the system
ah dia not not as fulfilling but
atau maybe about
nak cakap lack of audience pun tak juga ah
even dekat rumah pun
dia macam not as motivated lah untuk untuk pegang musical instruments
just in case tapi kalau dah beli then tak main
apa ah my other resolution
sebab ah before this kita depend on performance and
if we have side jobs yang
then tu macam bonus but by by the end of last year dia dah turn to the other way round
memang ah memang more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way lah because I tak selesa pun untuk keluar and perform and jumpa orang in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still nak ada event takut juga ah
kalau you punya new year resolution apa yang dah boleh tiru dah I punya
berasa macam I nak belajar japanese sebab I tengok food wars tu tapi
better untuk focus dekat
tu lah
tapi so far italian is not that hard I rasa I boleh catch up balik
ah and I suka sebab macam once you belajar italian you can kind of faham french as well dia ada kaitan ah dia dia ada kaitan
quite beneficial untuk learn that one language
sebab dia boleh branch out to bahasa-bahasa lain selain language to apa lagi you punya ni you punya azam
uh I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore cakap the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself dia dah ada everything yang dia nak
I rasa it's not
and then ending pun
you you you you decide the topic pula
apa yang akan jadi in two thousand twenty one ah
I rasa akan ada
for sure sebab in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
ah dia punya
macam musicians tak dapat buat shows
ah ya artist tak boleh buat exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start macam
to make everything better for myself lah sebenarnya especially if that's their only creative outlet
dia redundant it's very redundant
but what about live shows I think um live shows pun dah start ada search juga because um sebanyak yang start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations memang
social distancing code scanning and everything so itu pun I rasa in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
I baca dekat twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
dia orang cakap your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
macam flu or fever side effect yang teruk-teruk
so I think I pun tak walaupun I takut jarum but I don't think I akan stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
ya lah faham
I mean even sekarang masa pandemic pun I dah tak ingat what happened in june in may
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic ni akan berlangsung lama and they cannot depend on skill yang dia orang dah ada so they have to broaden their horizon
okay can you explain pasal stoicism sebab I try baca tapi I macam
apa you punya philosophy philosophical standpoint
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you memang dah
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding tak sama so
once the border buka
scandinavian countries dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama european
bukan yang yang yang tak payah stamp passport tu ah dia tak termasuk dalam schengen countries eh oh termasuk oh then why
tapi I memang curious on how they can manage to provide
what about southeast asia or asia lah in general ada tak yang you nak pergi
ke kita memang western centric
I think sebab I think the the the reason is because
um dia orang preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit macam dekat sini most of them are
tapi asia I
nak pergi tak I nak pergi indonesia but but but the parts yang kita tak pergi before ah
I think tu pun interesting and for some reason
I nak pergi thailand sangat sangat sebab I rasa macam I nak dia punya street food
tu jer kot as for now
ah india but maybe bila umur dah lima puluh nanti lah boulogne and lah
mm selain tu
eh tapi yang tesla buat
the space flight yang you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
kan they dia buat dia buat this err flight flight system baru yang mana you can travel across the world in less than three hours ke two hours a'ah
so I don't know if that is still running sebab dia nak
benda tu affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years ke
balik hari jer pun boleh
I suka that documentary
centric tapi understandable lah sebab creator dia pun from
wah I punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam what do you want
you dah cakap you stoic so I dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu
apa yang you nak change
mm I faham
tapi tu lah I think I learn more
ah dekat dekat internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually kat okay I mean form five pun I don't have
and I tak pakai
hujung form five I pakai iphone but before that I pakai
ada laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use ah but I
I lebih I I understand bila ayah yang ajar
kena ambil to TOEFL lah lagi sekali
tapi tu lah dia punya price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so dia expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until dia expire macam the last time I ambil rugi jer
then sia-sia even if you dapat offer travel while once you nak masuk dia akan minta balik your TOEFL punya sijil then you have to take again
two thousand twenty one ni
kira start of the decade kan
bukan yang two thousand twenty kan last year was the ending
a'ah kita tunggu the fireworks
kita tunggu the fireworks but nothing happen
I pun takde expectation
that that one quite fast tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah
I harap
entah lah I don't have any
poll sekarang
like dia macam
tak dia from semua benda sebab
I tak rasa
macam you tadi cakap lah ah
afterlife punya benda kita tak tahu and it's not within our control kan dan ni pun sama it's not within my control so whatever happens happens lah
apa pun yang dia orang buat I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
tu jer
entah lah
tapi I I'm quite positive about
tak hopeless sangat
it's been awhile since I rasa hopeless dengan
the whole tahun
oh kaum is a very sensitive issue
and I tak suka tengok Facebook comment
dia almost macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu you don't have any feelings at all
ah bangsa malas membaca
lepas tu tajuk everything click bait
ah I wish that kena change
yang tu kena change
but journalism yang spark head
orang yang malas membaca tu ya malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun they have to click in order to know the
ni nurse yang nurse yang yang ni infected tu dekat yang vaksin mm mm
and then kismis dan
mm tapi yang news pasal nurse tu very misleading sebab even if you take your first vaccine untuk dia sampai ke fifty percent immunity tu dia ambil dua minggu
dia kena COVID within I think hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu it's not even two full weeks yet and even kalau dah two full weeks pun not a full total immunity
second shot baru ni tapi
and lagi pun journalisms sekarang mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then jadi satu bentuk berita ah yang penting ada content ya monetisation and yang penting duit jalan K
tapi content memang tak best langsung especially because the audience dalam Twitter and dalam Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
oh dah ni
lagi satu minit there's only one minute left
ah nanti kan bila you dah settle you click right ah tick ah
okay lah macam tak rasa sangat can speak one hour macam tak
main balik ah
yang ayam punya rank
hero lama
aku main more to majors tho so
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention aku punya
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told aku actually spend
like at least for me kan aku kena baca all the builds dulu tau dengan tengok video semua before aku main
kalau rank
rank siang my chicken rank
where people think like kita semua
player baru but
aku join lah
cause like if you fight from afar then siapa yang nak fight dekat depan tiada orang
oh ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when kita lolita dengan apa ah
like lolita dengan siapa
um but aku nak try fighter juga ah
ya ya it's the freya it's the fighter and they did dia orang macam revamp freya right but because macam tiada orang like no one really hear nor really plays freya that much so
actually itu aku smash buttons jer bro aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca skill pun
aku just smash smash
tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang lah then like
hmm so the skin pretty lah but the skill not there ah itu itu I think kau main dengan aku punya freya aku think kau pun boleh menang eighteen senang gila
the rank so I think aku just
I also can like ideate do some research on freya sikit jer bukan macam full blast macam aku punya vexana semua yet if you hear my vexana right
menang menang menang all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
um tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat lah some more vexana is like slow kind
so macam easy target gitu macam macam dia orang walking ducks then kau hunt dengan rifle then it's hunting season lah bro so like
shoot shoot jer tapi aku mage so ya aku shoot shoot gini lembat gila tapi target masih kena
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun dia macam
merapek it's like one of those weak
majors but kalau kau tahu main then dia lah tapi kalau kau tak tahu main
then ramai orang panggil kau
apa ah jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
aurora is lembab
dia tahu golek golek jer
vexana burns um dia punya target semua tapi like aurora
macam step lawa jer shiny shiny macam dia setakat over then I dengar eh tak nak nanyi let it go
to jer dia tahu
fighter what is this dragon apa ini dragon rider
eh dia jadi dragon ini bukan jadi dragon rider
entah lah apa lah aku tak pernah nampak character itu ini lah what's in the league
I think kalau ada background music untuk aku punya balmond kan nanti bila dia buat yang ulti itu dengar quack
but okay lor balmond aku think
no okay why aku choose balmond kan because when my sister um she just started playing so you have new characters to play
so aku
okay at least kau sedar diri then boleh lah
kau jangan step jadi tank yu zhong ke apa dragon orang semua ingat kau nak dragon up ke dragon tales
dia macam hype sekarang
ah dia orang dia orang revamp hilda and like really give her
so korang semua recall kan this hilda sneaky dia dekat dalam bush and she's just recovering health consistently
kau tahu kau dalam bush kan then you press this one skill later your speed laju
nanti kau zoom dengan hilda dengan dia punya muscle muscle dia
itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat like kalau ada music background ah nanti dengar
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it mana ada spend ah
simpan pun buat apa ini apa saving account
were to put a real term on hilda it's like all of a sudden kan kau tengah buat kerja
then all of a sudden ada one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right ah semua kan dah ada tempat protector semua
so dah lah habis lah
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then bila mana dia habis kan then
you burn your health then macam like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then kau imagine kau dah tiada mana then kau pun burn down
dah double edged sword lah itu
lost world itu
where as hilda is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise minum protein semua
but I need to practise hilda I so so scared dia orang pun debuff hilda eh cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing hilda
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly dia orang ban macam tak make sense lah
no lah ah ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus dia orang ban siapa like basic gusion
oh cause did not admit cause dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka smash smash button abeh

wah so shiok to wake up on a monday to atas view of orchard and eat breakfast in bed in
it's it's in the middle of town but it's like the entrance is ulu but in town like like you cannot find the entrance like if you didn't tell me I wouldn't know where is it
no lah but at the rate like we are walking like ulu hotel entrance but literally in the middle of town is like
I think the only thing you cannot tahan is the toilet because of the frosted glass toilet
their customer their customer base quite like a lot what people go there and makan like I think because lucky plaza is cheap
ya the grandparents are both super cute but I think the grandma like err sit on the chair only but the thing is when you eat there right you cannot like chill chill you know like lim kopi like lunch hour people take their own time
ya ya like it's not like you're eating like super slowly but like sometimes you have the macam the luxury of eating at your own time own target but here maybe if you're not used to how their system is like the first time right the first few times we went we like oh ya cannot own time own target cannot choose your own seat cannot
no not ayam merah the there there is this minang store in lucky
ah indoor and I like because they have this sapi goreng or empal ya ya that one is nice it's not bad I brought risa there she ate like she order all the vegetables I'm like what the hell
because the husband kena heart attack what but that one heart attack in sleep so like she don't want like confirm plus chop she also kena lah
macam over the past twenty years
diabetic sana
she was eating a whole plate of tauge
tahu and all but but the bulk of it is tauge and I'm like she is eating one big plate of tauge I'm like okay healthy people
ya they're forced lah like die die die die must do what because like oh shit people know I've been gym-ing so so it's like if I don't show any result or something like quite lian</mandarin like quite embarrassing lah or like macam you know remember you made this comment about a schoolmate you said ugh she workout so much but don't really see much difference remember
wait so after we eat we're going to go to the Rolex centre cause we atas
at where oh so much for like not atas and then want to shop some more
I am eyeing that item online if I buy outside some more right habis
no if it's white I think I'll wear it only for really like macam events like like events ah
you should wear plain clothes then just wear bright coloured like err hijab so it's not so jialat it's like
jangan berangan lah please
okay you know what if if we don't get it then it's okay we can just err balik I mean like whatever I just if if we if have I will dabao and buy
rabak lah this one if if they tow away no if clams still can remove if they tow away it's gonna be another problem trying to like find the freaking bike cause it's like where is your bike why you why you ya so
chai chee like really bedok chai chee like really very err what's that called it's just really very ulu lah
so if you staycay in dekat town hall to see you
err no merepek lah but six hundred is expensive mahal
mana ada momok it's it's padang what
no it's gonna be operational in jan but leceh because it's malaysia so they're err authorities approval system is all bloody slow it's
like I think you really I don't know lah whether you need to like but then malaysia boleh so everything boleh you just need to have money
the younger ones ah macam the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still lepak lepak and like
no ada what remember during the circuit breaker the the the
the expat yang is it the group of expat pergi robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching what like kalau like kalau dorang didn't get send back home eh actually dorang tak kena hantar balik kan
exactly that's why this people expats all rich what boleh bayar
but then again right it's quite bodoh because you think about it ah kita tak boleh gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody boleh nampak
yup my cheeks are like oh my god it's like rabak
but then cannot do anything but it's okay lah the mask will cover so uh tutup jer muka and the trick is pakai nice eye makeup so the mata nice like lawa the
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because um nanti orang perasan
no orang akan perasan and orang akan rasa macam eh dia ni caring eh this person boleh dengar aku
no you cannot do this because all these mamat belok ni semua macam um
dorang is it bebal dorang bebal so
and also kalau even kalau macam um oh is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this mamat-mamat especially malaysia you must think like the typical melayu
actually I don't get it macam it's only in games mah like you can talk ah but macam why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
what is favourite buaya
bodoh lah oh my god he
what bila dia nak tidur then he play game and sayang sayang people
tak dia bini bini nanti kalau bini bangun dengar is it bini dia tahu
bodoh lah it's just like cari pasal
husbands game so much ah biar pe tak kasi attention lah tu lah ni lah
interest lor or like um like like their own free time ah you cannot just macam oh aku nak main game tapi kau kena make time for aku macam all that shit lah I don't know
while playing game how is the kid going to be concentrating bapa dia tengah main game
why cannot main game kat rumah
there's bodoh it's just like
ah ya lah dekat kita punya void deck bawah block like the the kind that government makes
dia duduk tepi road untuk main game
macam dekat park or like the estate
just to main game until really late
but then dia main kat keluar dia pakai data
apa tu err is it some flu vaccine thingy the normal one ah
it's only sakit because it's not like
ah I don't want tak nak takut
asal okay now I scared tak nak is uh is wait
no I went to the toilet what then you were telling the story then emilio also said something then I didn't really hear apa
no tapi apa tu kan is like err isn't it like penetration unless they put their whole fist inside then then
exactly so why would you bleed if it's only tangan
I think maybe they should try to lube people when they do pap smear jadi dia lube
tak nak lah give up
nanti aku takut lah like what the fuck oh my god alah now I'm like oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm gonna be like so worried
pekik or not huh
ah okay my tolerance for pain is teruk so I'm like okay now I'm like err oh my god
then I think the the thing about orang-orang yang first time kita semua bela sotong you know right
tak ambil epidural ke
oh the contraction before dia sakit
nak so macam pergi pergi appointment first time semua macam apa tu
err pregnancy first err blur blur pergi appointment husband pun blur blur
pasal awkward
ya nasib kentang pergi clinic seorang orang husband tak nak ikut
I told you what we had this conversation yesterday kan I say kan some husband check-up macam tak nak lah geli lah takut lah nak tengok lah tu lah ni lah tapi semua nak bila nak ambil semua nak
got lubang any lubang also can
everything lubang just lubang
at least the mum ikut I think it like kalau kena
you eavesdrop dengar apa jer
as in budak tu nampak dah pregnant tu tengah oh
tapi the youngest yang aku nampak
she's turning twenty one next year habis anak dia turn seven and I'm guessing tak habis school lah right
unless err defer sekolah atau pergi sekolah until like you're thirty eight thirty
no you can differ what macam skip school for ya lah macam lepas beranak she can pergi sekolah then mak dia jaga lah
fourteen what the hell kau beranak fourteen empat belas tahun empat belas tahun you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right kau beranak like oh my god kau beranak at like enam belas tahun or like maybe uh enam belas tahun onwards kau beranak is still considered teenage mum
kau beranak at empat belas it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was I was waiting for my menses
err maybe their pull out game rabak lembap atau uh atau err because oral contraceptive kena bayar condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
you bodoh lah just bodoh
eh but then again there are people on or like even the tubal ligation then tiba-tiba mengandung
no sometimes it's quite uh quite err oh ya after the menstrual cycle entah lah tak tahu
and then ya is people all this whatever lah I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like tak gagak sia
why would you why would you do that tapi kan she signed on to army so is like
empat belas tahun catch no ball with a son to look after
the sperm stay inside bodoh it's like
because when they do sex education we are asian dorang tak nak cakap oh korang tak boleh ada sex with like condom but kids are not stupid they're watching porn eh eight or nine years old
huh but all kids have phone now what you know even if they don't know how to search right you know sometimes like let's say you know like you watch show habis ada pop up
penat entah macam okay one of the reason eh sebab secondary school dengan primary school dah habis sekolah tau so macam ah dah nak masuk holiday mindset aku dah macam ah nak holiday nak holiday nak holiday abeh tapi poly masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja ah lagipun during this period ah the exams are like
nak kena apa jaga safe distancing kan so like the exams are out so most of our
so macam and most of the time kan my graded assignment semua kena buat report and for report confirm nak kena buat research banyak
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a banyak benda ah so
macam by the time dah habis sekolah macam ah dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat and nak balik rumah one hour journey macam just the thought about it dah buat aku penat and when I came home
I submit lah but it was like ah macam
half half macam macam fifty percent punya reflection journal a'ah ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya itu jer abeh like
like you saw ah macam I just macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis oi
eh but your poly days macam lagi rabak because
like creativity like err macam ah
no because three point one is more of macam internship tau and these tuesday ada briefing on the internship ah and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it macam I don't know because macam okay macam I don't know eh because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced kau macam put it in a beautiful way
tapi tapi just the thought of um having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean err ya it was at home so like but quite like mendak macam like err no err so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that yang assigned dia through
I don't know lah dia tak elaborate ah but but yeah it was mostly a research
dia datang for like one two days first two days leh then the period starts
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first kan orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like macam familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building tapi for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
macam gitu ah so like and kan dorang like most of my kawan yang year ones
dorang like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the ah school punya website
so macam
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right kan so macam dorang macam
how am I supposed to berbual with this person gitu ah
no lah I berbual english because by the time right for my batch dah banyak ada yang ambil tamil gini semua
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret masuk poly ya but
but I didn't regret masuk poly because like because certain things macam how
okay so aku macam old schools sikit computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how kental I am
ya so diam so ah so bila masuk poly tiba-tiba dah kena buat ah share document and all that then I was like apa ni apa ni I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like macam
like I don't know I don't know ah macam if I think that macam eh
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like huh apa ni like what am I supposed to do there ah so macam
no wonder kau selalu pergi library I thought it was to like to baca buku no
since I'm already eighteen right so macam some some things that actually almost all of the things kan kau kat aku
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so macam I tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things daripada mami dan abi macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda everything first hand aku selalu dapat second or third hand aku macam I was kind of jealous at that point of time tapi that
macam dengar like what's like actually what happened actually so macam okay lah not deserved lah macam
not deserve lah macam okay lah deserve lah sikit deserve lah
macam messenger facebook
oh secondary three secondary four okay so macam
okay firstly kan since ah okay so the teachers pun macam tahu ah like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates semua macam ah heck care macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni just it was that bad uh like even like teacher pun macam what
tapi for me right
why not have fun macam macam this is the last few days sebelum like macam like some macam ya macam ya
a good memory lah so like our class macam quite
rabak ah to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like macam act serabak dorang lah like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
ah so macam
I had to do most of the things that macam
like attendance ah keep track of apa
dah hantar acknowledgement slip or whatsoever ah so and most of the time even the teachers know that ah
macam tanya monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one yang akan represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
it was that bad so macam all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students ah twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
tak ada satu pun ah terpaksa ah ah
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one lah the four years lah it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like kakak was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time err I don't know leh because ah tapi like they most of the teacher point out ah like I am so different from you and abang ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what macam ya no matter what ah
aku akan avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
B three I don't want to tell you tak payah ah so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us dah macam go through many things so like and sec three sec four ada macam project macam masa tu ada this international is a apa humanitarian job ah so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising lah so like almost like everyday kita orang stay back and macam pop up macam this one booth kita orang jual air jual roti jual pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates lah so macam and had a lot of fun lah then bila secondary four okay by the time secondary four semua orang dah tahu that is going to be the last year and this is the last time untuk macam rebel ah bukan rebel ah as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow ah macam and since kita orang dah tahu is our last year kan semua orang makin rapat
and then so macam
even when macam ah the teachers like complain about us and then our class macam ah it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
macam this class macam hais this class like ah ah
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us err pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy err male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like oh my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like err on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear punya height
eh tak actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder ah so macam everytime right I will like gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek then sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi so macam uh geram ah but this kind of memories like macam ah
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days macam it's just like
A B C D E F ah so macam but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class ah
but then like for the lower class right dorang like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing kesian juga macam like everyone akan tengok ya but then but the thing I hated the most because kita orang the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because kita orang macam macam ah okay ah tak payah apex camp no I am more of a person of yang tak suka interact bukan antisocial
cuma I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend ah ni
kau hold grudge eh
so means dorang stay back longer than kau stay back ah
oh then why didn't you like cakap to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six punya kerja
but did you realise everytime during camp or macam stay over kat sekolah kan
like most of us are macam tak tidur
oh korang tidur eh
oh no because for my batch right macam everytime kalau ada macam ada qiyam or macam macam sleep kat sekolah kan
selalu like malam kan kita orang tak tidur
kita orang kita orang uh tidur dekat level three the boys tidur dekat level one but then ah toa payoh
ah okay so ah so but then kita orang dekat level three kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual ah with the girls ah kita orang berbual ah macam gossip something like that
like dekat parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand kita orang macam curious ah like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning oh one lah
then kita orang semua gather abeh tengok like
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did ah but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like tak tidur so the rest kena punishment but then right I think the male teachers like macam
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep macam tak terganggu with any check
creepy keras
and it was all girls lah but dah tak ada lelaki so ah ah oh then suddenly like two of us macam nak beli makanan and because it was during lunchtime and dah penat ah so okay lah the so it was left with me and another one friend lah kat dalam
suddenly we heard the same thing you know the macam the drain ya
of the another car park yang sebelah Mendaki sense it was the other it was the other side so like there's no car
there should be no car beside us and is at the level one so macam eh
why would I know that's why kita orang dah macam curious then so like err okay actually me and my friend were like talking so macam we heard that sound then we were like
kita orang diam kita orang like give each other a look ah then like okay ah how about we just like macam macam
ah ah kita orang rasa macam how about we err we buy drinks from the vending machine then I was like so kita orang keluar a'ah
add up bila dekat luar baru kita orang macam did you hear that
but to be honest like the chalet or the like house right macam scary like the vibe
and it was like so far from the bus stop and the bus stop pun like quite sunyi
to be honest I've never encountered this type of situation and I don't want to encounter this type of situation ever because to be honest I'm quite a scary cat juga lah
no because because to be honest compared to the both of us kau lagi rabak so I had to be the one yang okay with it so macam ah I cannot
I think it was during the lunchtime lah so macam uh so some of us like went out to
mafia game eh no eh I don't know it was one of the games so we had macam macam ah
bukan application lah it was just a website kita orang ini so kita orang enter macam this group I'm in that kira macam game pin
then the masuk no no it was not telegram it was just a website ah so macam dah gitu so they will assign the mafia or the spy gitu so for that game we had to question each other lah like okay so ah what is this place this place have like
it was the Mendaki side punya Mendaki sense punya side and was the second level and the other corner bukan the corner to parade square the other corner nak masuk hall canteen
err how about we stop this this game because no one tau because we always like eh macam I point like someone else lah it was you then the other guy was no I thought it was you no I thought it was you so we were like who is this ah ah ya that's why we showed our phone lah macam no it's not us tak ada pun tak ada like kita orang tengok kat phone kan
eh all of us are like the macam workers staff at the place tak ada orang the spy
ah no the like no we macam they would like macam is there macam enough players kira macam this is like dah macam start the game so that only the players kira macam even we didn't like say the game pin out loud so macam none of us like
tak ada orang ah boleh suspect[oh no what happen oh because the day before kita orang tengok
during the stay back punya time ah mengundang
because I don't know because like it was like with the class kan so macam the scary movie macam the horror movie macam tak affect tak affect langsung ah
but then the next day it happens so kita orang macam ya
because they have to tap to masuk right
uh like apa with
kunci or was it a lock or oh pin okay
this dengan siapa
okay cakap pasal horror stories right
okay one of my friend have sixth sense dia boleh
like dia boleh nampak a few things like things that you cannot kita orang tak boleh nampak ah
so there was this one time kat dalam class
but then I just sat beside her except because kawan rapat kan no it was in primary school it was ah level eight so the teacher was like teaching okay lah macam biasa
then suddenly my kawan macam eh why is this guy standing outside from just now then I was like
pusing ah pusing tengok then I was like there's no guy there's no one
then I was like because um I'm quite macam rapat juga ah primary six and our class is at the eight level which is the highest level and
ya it's quite macam nanti ada connected to another building and that building quite
kosong there's no one it's empty ya so I was I was turning my head then I was like I saw no one then I was like I macam dah hyperventilate macam apa ini what is happening but um I quite rapat dengan dia so I know that she can see these things lah
again lah if he is he still standing there because mungkin it's just a person like just passing by or something lah going another class or just another parent ke tengah nak tunggu their child I don't know I just thinking a lot of possibilities situation ya then
not so clear like he's like just like macam bayang
and dia pakai baju black clothes clothing don't don't don't don't then okay okay then I ask my friend lah
like imagining stuff on like on my right side of the class so macam no I was supposed to be at end of the side because that was my friend kan so macam I wanted to sit beside her lah teman for that class for that lesson
tak akan nampak that thing macam I just don't want to see that thing macam tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I don't want I don't want I don't want I just avoid looking at that
oh macam my humanity korang ah but then you don't

where are you going with your boyfriend besok
ibu abah akiff me
mirza said dia kena bangun bangun at four
four then lepas tu dia book out at ten
on a pair of like shoes you know kasut alexander something ah tak ingat
then after that like last last dia punya boyfriend dia tak tak tak tak pakai
the boyfriend punya birthday is coming soon then I suggested her like a handmade gift like you know the card
then I told her you should buy him like something small like macam airpods or something
or a watch then dia cakap okay lah eh that's a good idea then I think
five dollar jer seh dia punya template
is it raining I love the weather this past few days adik do you want to know what happened to me
and the earliest slot of is january so by the time like I sudah habis my is already
february dia punya slots
salah saya I'm just telling you
you know when she looks at the kakak she's like
because mala the rempah dia sama tapi like the ingredients you can switch it up you know what I mean
like macam this guy
his dia melayu dia
nama dia zul
a lot of the people in the like they always look down on him ah not look down lah like macam
macam cakap ee ketot then after that he cried you know oh my god
they'll be like eh kenapa kau kau nangis aku tak faham gitu
I say tapi kau rugi because
his whole tuition fee has been sponsored by MENDAKI apa
so kirakan it's like free education and you could just going to like
then dia orang punya written test also like he say is not that hard
sampai I don't know because I took a nap from five
like macam he thinks that he knows how to code
tapi now
is it like the japanese punya types of you know those big sandwiches
how many followers dia ada
feed apa
he say kasihan
adik mirza
dia tak ada kids messenger right it's only dia punya kakak right
I think you guys should've like incorporated those old school punya
lagu like um lagus that they reminisce to instead of like now
punya trends
dia mesti tak jaga betul-betul is it
tak baik dia pergi kidnap
this situation of like he thinks it's a pontianak
and they need to make some rounds lah around the ammunition punya dump area
tempat that is very keras you know
abah keep quiet I'm recording

so this guy the chinese guy dia macam action tau dia macam like okay lah
like the forested area lah dekat belakang the ammunition dump
the chinese guy keeps keeps on like he was being persistent lah like eh jom ah let's go let's go plus I playing like some songs so you don't need to hear anything
like someone err I don't know ah like macam like you know err how
pontianaks in in movies like before they appear dia orang nyanyi macam mm
encik ah he say encik I I don't want to go back ah
ya that's it but he didn't he didn't like macam
ya then dia orang pun bodoh dia orang pun bodoh still want to go there not dia orang ah like
tapi like we are living separate life like I feel like as long as we don't kacau them they don't kacau us you know what I mean
but why sometimes when I listen to ghost stories they attack without like macam any reason
like you know the puaka
beginning of december dia orang
so in the end my my friend dia belikan dia punya boyfriend dia

aku punya mind aku macam wait are they are they needing orang nak berbual
untuk event or something aku macam yes this is my opportunity
aku berhati-hati interview rupanya
oh okay lah boleh lah
I was thinking macam aku mati-mati yang macam ah aku buat macam
host and event or something macam itu tau
they need speaker for an event macam macam macam lagi oh bukan is not
hey tapi banyak seh
penat sia satu um we need to be mentally prepared satu kau punya pantat kena duduk satu jam satu itu semua lah
unless kalau they give us like you know like a questionnaire untuk kita buat or I mean like not questionnaire atau paper but I think macam they ask us a question that you have to elaborate begitu aku rasa it will be better
macam aku interview orang so macam kita kan seleksi yang better compared to us having a normal conversation and we don't have that case conversation macam kena record
oh ya kau tadi kau
aku macam aku macam
aku macam tengah contemplating a lot
aku macam a lot of thing tengah main lah fikiran otak aku
aku tahu dekat they have like satu ni where you become masyarakat kau tahu macam every
how do I say this like sometimes macam radio station or even macam company oh macam gag
yes they all do those challenges tukar inti itu
okay the kakao macam the face of apa cakap
faces of her school no macam kau buat cara cakap youtube dia orang bagi
yo senangnya kerja tu orang main game aje
the would I have belakang tapi like have to climb
fikir game apa yang best

ada each poly ada
each poly ada ada
ada extreme runner dia main silat air tu like like is like right the same thing
aku nak join but the fact dia punya
copy timing dia is
mm betul like
aku macam I want to find that is fun but kalau ada sikit macam not much commitment lah gitu
macam aku okay aku contemplated a lot of benda firstly ibadat secondly aku nak masuk um
apa begitu macam um voluntary work tapi dekat macam banyak gila voluntary work aku boleh buat
so I think volunteering work yang they work banyak ada yang buat sikit
so aku nak cari yang banyak dan sikit so right now tak takde takde satu pun yang cipta untuk aku
aku pun nak elak nak masuk islamic
macam tu content nanti banyak benda
ya islamic punya group
they ada for that
mm aku ingat macam the name is macam malay cultural group itu tapi dia have different macam cabang-cabang
so macam ideas mm
tapi aku ni dari yang islamic punya community
tapi tu best
macam dia orang masuk um buat amal ramadan
dia orang pack pack barang aku sangat suka tahu cakap tak tahu
okay nah aku macam
ajak a lot of macam fun
tapi macam aku nak banyak masuk tapi macam
macam commitment dia macam kau tahu tak aku punya course macam mana my course is a very
cause course aku is not an easy course
I I definitely say I could've mentally prepared to costly either that I might need to wake up two o'clock to do my journal to do my journalism punya apa topic
mass comm is like easy easy apa easy course untuk masuk
and dia punya content pun macam kau tengok lah if like mass comm
mm film some video dengan editing yang itu kan these are the courses yang macam indirect hiburan and at the same time dia orang macam ah burn the midnight oil lah gitu dia orang cakap
ada orang shooting sampai dua pagi
wah bayangkan
aku rasa aku ada week kalau macam tu aku chillax chillax
silakan farzana mahu tidur lah
tinggal berapa minit ni ya allah empat puluh tiga forty three more minutes
oh aku di intern kan aku rasa
I might go to macam music what's that call music punya
aku nak belajar overseas like aku nak belajar overseas aku nak belajar overseas sebab aku nak rasa ya
being independent ya because kalau kau belajar overseas kau takde you have no excuse to know not how to cook
you must know how to cook to survive because kalau kau cakap home mak aku masak aku tak nak masak
kalau kat luar I have to cook for myself
so at the same time kau belajar untuk berdikari do household rasa macam mak aku rasa
so aku macam nak experience that thing tapi macam kesian pun lah tinggal parents aku
mungkin sebab you have like sister that's why like you don't have sister will be their house buruk-buruk macam mana pun kakak kau akan tetap kat di situ tapi the fact aku ni kakak
aku macam aku rasa macam berat aje tinggalkan mak aku berat jer tinggal family aku
we should though macam
ah overseas ke
actually aku macam nak masuk malaysia tapi macam
daftar sekali korea takde korea uh
cuma feeling kita pergi australia australia kat aku rumah australia
like aku pernah pergi
sedih um
anak comfort like satu macam ni afini dah makan ke belum have you eaten lunch ke belum

aku nak sangat I'm only want the account macam paling kita tiga like the three of us
coal banyak masak you you will be the one jap afini masak

ya okay kerja rumah
kerja rumah haven't vacuum mop
um apa lagi vacuum mop lipat baju uh

jemur-jemur kain pun aku okay
what kenapa kenapa why why
ya aku rasa kita yang lagi beberapa minute only
ya right mm nine more minutes lepas tu kita dye and dusted again lagu lah
lama seh kau nak buat berapa minutes lagi
like recording conversation I mean like for me personally kalau dua orang macam
lagi lagi iffa kau masukkan iffa dalam conversation ini it's gonna be like
I don't know how to describe lah kalau macam ni macam mana nak describe
um I think like kena satu ada satu topic untuk berbual
iffa iffa will always have that satu topic untuk ya converse within dua kita orang dua
aku anggap kita macam like more toward like bual-bual kosong
oh yang lelaki tu kan
eh they gave him macam
apa conditional a warning
aku rasa itu macam ada orang ought to see
like it's me kalau benda seorang yang benda sama ya
but macam kalau if you put it in term macam macam kita as a human punya equality
macam diri kita sendiri macam tak kisah orang tu race tu apa what is his race but logically like if you murder sama macam aku seorang you have
macam it's logic for someone to kena gantung ke
macam you murder someone
logically who kena gantung this is like um like the basic macam law that we know lah but
I don't know what derives dia punya court macam kasih conditional warning see the word conditional warning
a'ah so preposterous gila pergi beijing
I saw I go nampak yang punya news nanti
like they tweeted about the story pasal this thing ah
sekarang macam malaysia dah ada lot of cases like
a spike seh dia orang punya
like tiba-tiba kesian kesian lah
tak yang macam ada yang aku nampak tak pakai mask ada yang pakai so it's like aku rasa orang tu macam tak consistent lah
um itu cluster
ya betul betul wei ya dia ni macam pasal donald trump
dia punya anak punya anak kena COVID nineteen
anak donald trump kena COVID nineteen the fourteen years old punya yes
like so sad he's in rally macam
pathetic punya situation aku gelak gila
lepas tu like
macam kesian lah dia sekarang cakap K aku I read this news
they said that donald trump declares said dah balik daripada COVID nineteen
sebab dia nak sebab dia nak masuk election macam dia nak buat campaign
four more minutes lagi empat minutes
oh tahan
cepat lah please
aku rasa kan kita akan fail kita punya first try
no I think that use moment english but I use one malay so aku tak tahu like is like the same
uh takpe lah takpe lah
it's okay at least kita cuba and get the experience
I would say aku pernah kerja sekali hari ini satu kali
towkay towkay oh ya aku nak cari kau
aku try ini like small business yang buat macam
small business um bag ke sebab aku tengah cari small business untuk collaborate for open a giveaway
like aku nak support dia orang lah
okay I don't know I mean I mean ah oh kalau kau kena kena giveaway prize apa
kalau it's you prize apa yang kau nak
sebab aku ah apa tu
aku dapat satu semua besok satu kalau besok dia just started
so macam aku nak ini di situ saya turun orang so it's like a phone case punya business
kejap okay tak apa if he were to send you a gift that is a bloody portrait
kalau betul lah eh tiba-tiba kau dengan dia together malay malay if kalau betul kau dengan dia together
dah dah dah dah that's right err
and the flirting turns into like is a conversation how I talk to all my other friends so kalau if if kalau kau tengah berbual dengan dia and kau kau macam just cakap
eh kau kelakar seh aku suka berbual dengan kau
ya exactly so why you not talking to me that is a flirt you leave the person like eh siala why she talk like that she want me flirt to her ah oo la la so that's when kalau kau dah cakap macam asal kau tak berbual dengan aku ya exactly kau tak nak berbual aku pe kau busy sangat pe I'm not that important
okay dengar dulu so after you're in a relationship that after that your partner if they say is it weird dah dah dah
no tak when you meet him
like gap lah macam he probably thinks that kau macam lagi kaya or some shit like that right
I know prior to that he keep saying macam
acting eh macam kau self-realisation padahal tak ada apa-apa habuk pun takde
no like is it like macam is it
oh my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder atau uh Okcupid
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of um naive girls because you really really go through macam
to to the tee punya macam this one really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
amin abeh amin
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say tak nak kau you won't kau tak akan break up dengan mata air kau just to lepak dengan budak syafiq ni that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say ah buat apa
because I don't like you atau you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money aku kasi uh I aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit
atau dia bagi kau knowledge dia tak bagi kau opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to lepak
would would not get mad with you meh he will get mad what pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
if syafiq keeps telling you eh lepak ah lepak ah lepak ah when the first meeting problem starts with eh I didn't before sia there's there's gonna be this part of like
I would say because dia very religious kan kau just cakap macam just playfully flirt lah macam
things that make him feel like oh she really wants my attention like eh kau tak berbual dengan aku eh dah lama tak rindu seh or something like that so
it's not haram what I mean okay it is haram because you have the intention but then
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like macam step uh apa ni eh uh like you can flirt lah but then like
faham tak it's so many red flags sorry but
I would further macam I would pursue him
faham tak so bila kau dah macam together dengan dia not not if let's say he starts to
like it's either you are a good boy atau you are manipulative
for real huh dia hantar you portrait kimak budak-budak kental pe sia confirm aku cakap dengan kau
you kena cheated also eh we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
pukiwek three years abeh kena cheated eh siala
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like macam
kawan aku legit bila aku kecil-kecil kan dia memang betul religious habis the family and very baik so
shy baik and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary lah for you to just macam socialise what
she's the type that don't even wear tudung depan uh pakcik makcik
so legit eh ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung that kind of thing atau macam
eh uh berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut so when when she go out with these kind of uh men uh
um pasal everyday they remind themselves ah oh jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk that's fucking true let's be real macam and and that's why to me
in my head is like um if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and haram is not for you
kau masih nak try try try tapi kau tak up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is um
how do I say this ah everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so macam
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu so if she she say she don't want it then kalau um
he should know better what right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch sia this is not like macam remeh-temeh girl tau it's not like macam
for me to and not because like eh aku no no no I mean my gift alhamdulillah is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man faham tak
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like macam you're going through a lot of uh problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like eh family aku my family is uh uh poor I mean uh mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah
itu aku boleh bagi ah tapi buto kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like macam
and like macam I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
uh I'm blinded that was the one yang dengan the arab guy that I was with yang macam aku betul-betul sayang but dia macam
like dalam islam pun cakap a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so cakap dengan dia gitu maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that kalau kau nak macam if you play by insecurity saying that aiya aku tahu lah aku ni buruk aku tahu lah
and then diam lah sial macam do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that kena burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like macam ya so
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry aku macam really that's that's weird
it's weird ah macam
how to say ah it's weird it's weird unless kau macam
fan mail then legit kena call fan sia fan I also want to vomit sia huh kau fanatic dia ni when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
no you should tell him straight ah eh kimak kau lame pe kau hantar perempuan gini that means before aku kau hantar perempuan apa eh macam tiba-tiba
what the fuck do you do with your free time kau scroll perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar portrait
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh steady punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka
once you date me you die already you die already all my my macam bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already what I'm abusive what back then lah you know like I don't give a like bro aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak sia muka kau pun aku boleh pecah kan sia and as a guy also
who the fuck macam owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father lah but not your partner faham tak so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like kau dah mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy masuk jail cakap once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn eh
that is weird let's see kalau kau betul-betul cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet ah
faham tak cause
ya so that's why aku cakap kau it it all takes time what people especially when you like someone bro
and you've never been he been been uh at his lowest point of uh point in his life have you ever be that kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak
you fucking tell me engkau then apa diam ah sial then you want you have a better goal lah like it's simple as that macam
uh that that that that's where I play my game faham tak of like
I pick my battle lah macam okay this guy is enough for me
tell you before leh fuck bro kimak aku punya boyfriend dulu eh perempuan hantar dia macam
eh I saw you around school you look cute aku maki sia buto siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok you buat apa dia pasal what
asal kau you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
bapa aku sia nama bapa aku sial
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you kalau
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence punya
wait but then saturday sunday kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia
okay ya then then just hang with them like macam you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
stop it like macam if you tell your if tell your oh my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before macam
oh I went out with this girl I tak pernah I tak pernah
dia gila-gila kan I tapi I tak pernah uh apa ni
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that oh this girl got got macam
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that lah but he said as like macam okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I simplicate whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
you want to fucking go out with her because she got connection because she can give you some sort of like macam um
help with ke apa lan jiao
go ahead with it or whatever kalau macam nak tanya advice about macam kerja in the future ke apa go ahead with it but I'm not
like macam is not more of like macam oh I reciprocate back
so right now you are reciprocating back if your boyfriend were to tell you in the future you ada keluar dengan dia tak you pernah keluar dengan dia tak I was fond of him lah

okay boleh
wait avengers pasal apa
captain america tak nak
what do I like oo I like comedy oh damn eh err superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so aku rasa macam group macam a bit too much gitu
macam you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
dia macam a bit awkward
um so dia
so like the way that he act macam
macam half-hearted gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu
did you just see the the the one yang uh andrew garfield acted ya ya watch all spiderman exactly I think that's why I think it relates my life I don't know
ya aku tengok kat suntec tak tak salah
tak yang movie yang err real life action nya aku tak ingat siapa yang
sedih pe rumah kita kotak-kotak dok kau serious
apa dorang jual dekat supermarket
okay so kalau kita tukar penjara kita macam norway kau rasa boleh jalan
confirm ada banyak order in their own prison cell and and the fact that like in terms of like relapse I think like people will enjoy going prison because they know compared to singapore punya let's say err four room flat
amenities tak ada
so ya I think you really have to see dia punya apa ni culture
eh siala rabak sia
aku boleh pilih ah dia punya
macam tak biasa ah
eh sial lah aku tak belanja sia aku sedih sia cause last year last year aku macam bingit sendiri dengan sendiri tau
err aku tak ada duit kalau aku kan kerja kan eh aku tak kerja aku sekolah
so aku fikir cam simpan dalam apa dia punya basket eh shopping cart dia
benda-benda yang aku nak beli takleh afford
sedih sia
err entah macam
aku rasa aku terbawa-bawa dia punya feeling for sebelas sebelas punya sale
macam it's nothing for me um macam I don't have to worry about eleven eleven because there is black friday
because at the point of time last year black friday aku beli benda so but eleven eleven tak boleh sekali masuk kot aku rasa
kau takleh ni eh macam err collaborate
apa right right right
oh benda dia jalan
anting-anting jer kecil besar
macam stud gitu ah
sembilan puluh lapan siak ah beli kat shopee lagi berbaloi
repurpose ni kan kedai ashley lah mmhmm
eh but then if you take like macam for example if you take like the buttons from a top a blouse for example Chanel buttons how would you know it's actually authentic
belum sia eh kau tahu kan yang one thousand note dah tak boleh pakai
okay bukan tak boleh pakai it's more of like it's obsolete now um so like whatever that it's like remaining out there in the world whoever has the one thousand ya so uh laki aku cakap simpan dulu atau buat investment boleh jual kat carousell berjuta-juta dolar tak aku tipu jer so I don't know
like apa ni
err apa emas
kat cash converter eh cash converter betul lah money max situ ah ah maxi cash
kau fikir aku kena aku patut beli sekarang eh kalau sembilan dolar
ye lah
apa ni ah apa
ya simpan duit dulu ah
ya sekarang tak boleh belayar pergi mana-mana kau tahu pasal yang travel bubble
ye ke no lah I think like I mean it's more like commercial travel but um
tak normal like normal nya allergies jer
sakit ah sampai nangis semua
serious dia
laki kau kena block rabak
kirakan kau dah biasa ah
oh dia pun
tapi macam siak jer
dia gardener
damn oh kirakan dia dia kenal tu market
cam dia dia buat survey tak pernah beli
oh pandai juga eh because I have no idea who wants exotic plants I never met anyone
so dia baru start ke
apa nama dia mid-life crisis eh
mm dah lama kan I mean bukan lama sangat lah
macam a few years but
I think it's a thirty thing ah you start to reflect on your life and your parents dia bukan muda lagi
asal kau fikir gitu sia
aku rasa at this point in time
comparing to like our twenties kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu
and we're in denial of it macam other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like aku cuba ah solat subuh like susah sia nak bangun alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
aku bingit sia selalu adamnya ringtone kan it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying dia punya vibration dia just semacam tau
its more mellow so bila aku bangun macam like oh bird you know its much more
compared to bodoh punya handphone
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok belajar eh so I came across this Tiktok with post err they were mentioning about like err
my kesalahan right kesalahan aku it's not
on my husband's punya shoulder
my my kesalahan is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like tegur
so like it's the same thing as wife lah so sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh part tu kesalahan aku lah
so aku macam like aku tahu kan husband aku tak bangun then aku bangun kan dia so asal kan aku kejut kan dia kalau dia solat ke tak solat
okay aku tak tahu but that's how my understanding of it lah
like time kau bertemu janji
kau fikir macam like oh ah aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then kau bingit sendiri
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara
ah kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam oh aku tak sayang dia so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me lah but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume aku aku macam in a way macam a bit
so ya sometimes dia macam hint hint hint then aku macam like what is it that you want and dia dia macam he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then macam like cannot make up his mind his decision then aku macam bingit ah
oh kau kau tolong dia ah untuk hantar barang-barang
tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang like perasaan semua then apa dia cakap
untuk kau kot the way that you say it
dia mat teruk okay
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card bila kau run away kan swipe
you you you run away now you deal with it later so nanti dia accumulate accumulate ah then one day bam oh spark fire
eh dok Tiktok aku dah obsessed tau dengan Tiktok
tapi itu tak pakai that kind of idea untuk business kau sendiri
orh itu lah inspirasi kau orh dia filter tu glove putih glove apa lagi kau nak
kau tak ada glove oven sekali
yang penting aku angguk muffin
mungkin kau punya hidung boleh ni ah boleh sense kau tahu yang mingles dia boleh sense the weather berapa degrees
err aku kena unlock phone jap eh
um nak masuk tiga puluh lima minit
okay kita harus berbual
lagi sikit lagi jap maths aku tak bagus
satu jam enam puluh minit kan betul lah maaf ye saya mengajar seni lukis okay siapa eh
months adam has been obsessed with like watching documentaries so every single night before we sleep but he finds it as an entertainment so dia tengok um macam YouTube nya video semua
abeh dia ketawa-ketawa sendiri aku bingit lah macam like sial ah sis nak tidur sia kau takmo ah abeh buka kuat-kuat pula tu bukan nak pakai earpiece
then bro ya so like err I mean it's entertaining to them because like you know trump super confident so he's like in a way find this macam like a a filler for him to before you sleeps ya so aku first macam annoyed ah but then like err it's one day one night that I actually joined him is quite funny actually cause of the trump being himself ya allah
ketawa siak
kesian dia eh
kau nampak dia punya post
abeh kau tengok kan the documentary um now I think that's one in on on netflix
oh oh I saw um I saw this on Tiktok masih masih ah eh masih Tiktok
dorang tengah compare biden bila dia tua err and captain america avengers tua dok sama dok lepas tu kan kau tahu ah captain america yang time dia muda before he became captain america err then after that compare to biden time muda sama dok
dok dia gonna be president for life dok
nanti aku tunjuk kau post dia
nanti aku tanya dia ah mana tahu dia tengah check dengan dia punya
kawan ah
err ada tapi dia dalam aku
so but tak banyak ah cause it's
aku tak tahu aku tak ingat ni semua adam punya ya cause okay aku tahu this is not a good way to do it but because my husband is a agent so aku serahkan semua kepada dia so macam like uh my mother is a bit upset ah macam like okay mean
um everything on the table what if you know what if what if right so that would be on me lah if let's say anything happens but aku sekarang macam like nak tahu benda ni semua pasal insurance investment aku macam segan sikit so bila aku nak tahu nanti aku tanya because it's just that that's why can you stop asking
dia ambil from the
tak tahu ah apa
my yang yesterday he just shared with the cousin who just invested with him and I think after a few months dah naik two thousands sia two thousands
tahu lah hor
tengah fikir life tu apa benda
lima tahun siol
eh sembarang lah ah you
asal kau rasa kau takleh takleh dapat pula kau kan designer
kau repeat english jer tapi kau tak belajar kan
syabas girl
paper two ke paper one
oh yang macam compre sekarang lain seh
a'ah dia macam like ah dia ada macam paragraph lepas tu ada macam like uh uh err apa ni bukan fill in the blanks macam just blank blank blank kat tepi tau so macam in this certain line kau cari idea dia
so macam like if the for example the word err the sentence is this is the is the whatever then error is the repeated lah the is just write there is
ya basically macam eh it's vetting kau vetting proof reading its a proof reading exercise I am so jelly they don't have summary anymore
aku tak faham sia
dia faham ah yes sir do you
entah aku nak tahu kalau macam benda-benda ni kan dia boleh berbual macam singlish berbual macam melayu
hey Alexa buka anak metropolitan
since last year tak salah okay I know this year dah memang ada
biasanya sec one sec two sec three
and apa-apa whatever small activity last one will be end of the year exam
ya so kalau kau screw up technically kau boleh screwed up the first three but then kau tak back up and kau tak belajar ke apa eh kau tak faham
but is that they want to like macam lessen dia punya
camne nak cakap eh
to the free time I won't say free time macam
dia ada kerja mana ada kerja sikit it depends on how you see it
sebagai cikgu aku rasa aku suka yang lama punya because it's much more as in its more pro for teachers rather than the kids because the kids would be more stressful ada tiga major tiga exam tiga peperiksaan ada common test ada mid year ada end of the year
aku ajar art jer
aku rasa untuk budak lah menarik because like the fact that they know that this err the first three weighted assessment is not as heavy as last one so they can learn at their own pace but some students especially the sec ones
dorang macam like
rasa macam like dorang dah like gerek ah macam like eh tak payah belajar then ni ni jer buat buat quiz jer buat group work jer ah tak payah kita relax jer ah until they reach to the end eh bila macam september sept holidays eh sial lah next week ada peperiksaan sial lah aku belum belajar eh sial lah apa sia tu aku belajar dari january tadi ah so dorang panic ah so if they would have to grasp they if they have grasp the concept
of the this topic that they have learnt in err in from january onwards right then you don't have to worry you ah but kalau dorang macam like ah aku tak kesah aku boleh belajar procrastination and it won't do
online tak online dorang tak belajar langsung
siak aku bingit siak nak ajar dorang online satu ah selalu problem apa camera
cikgu tak boleh nampak ah cher cannot see you pasal aku tak on lah bodoh its like err okay teacher cannot hear you then you unmute lah ada message cher I just woke up
kau ingat apa invitation apa so macam err
um I will have to ask I don't know why macam like aku tak tahu pasal err budak-budak ni kan dorang baru bangun ke tak biasa dengan online punya attendance taking so dorang macam lemak sikit
example eh budak-budak ni nama dia azmi
dia tak dia bukan online ah dia dia dia dia tengah tidur ke apa
okay can anyone call azmi please terus senyap
um everyone can hear me right nod nod will be nice tak ada sikit ah satu dua tiga budak aku nod okay can you call azmi senyap
then aku macam sial ah apa siak
kau tahu aku kena call azmi pe sekarang then lepas tu aku type dia punya yang class monitor ya aku err tapi dorang tak respond I don't know they are scared to talk online or something to show their face oh my god so difficult aku tak tahu how ugly they look dude I seen you in school I know how you look like for goodness sake nobody cares oh my god aku nya online tau aku busy online aku pilih debate so technically its gonna be very hard the thing is we talk and we need to see each other face
to react on the on the reactions lah ada budak perempuan ni err kat rumah kan so tak payah ikat rambut ah boleh rembang kan semua aku rasa dia baru habis mandi dia main rambut dia kanan ke kiri twirl twirl twirl abeh senyum-senyum sendiri kat handphone eh sial ah aku bingit sia aku ambil video abeh aku tunjuk kawan-kawan aku
super annoying why she trying to flirt with me oh my god I I dah stress then lepas tu aku message one of the err the student in the senior aku message eh tengok kena annoying aku cakap dia suka budak err yang dekat eh dia cakap ah ada satu laki dia nak cui
dia tengah so annoying oh my god gini gini sial lah aku takleh concentrate sia
pasal some kan that point of time they were having like like err field training so the coach was lecturing tak kan aku nak excuse me sorry ah

sekarang the
the the first project was actually video editing then I I was like really rabak ah
I have someone to depend on kalau I tak tahu then you
dah lepas intern what's your plan
kerja part time ya I think most probably I'm going to look for like a full time job so I'll be like more secured you know
something like or engineering end up you nak go to like something yang tiada kena mengena before you studied
higher NITEC cert but I rasa kalau dah dapat diploma
tak apa lah like oh tak mahu berbual pasal kerja lah stress
the first place I want to go is actually just I nak
shopping and makan and just relax but it's like the nearest at least
like you buy your groceries ke you beli makan ke or you like even if you just uh stay at hotel over there

malay food I eat it's just I tak suka asam pedas but if fast food
like no matter how many times I eat or how long I makan already I still go to McDonald's
like I'm sure I'm sure everyone favourites is McDonald tak ke

go sentosa untuk apa
dia naik habis suddenly dia turun
what tak ada kena mengena car and roller coaster
who said I tak suka car I like car
people boleh bahagi masa dia orang to to be into this
so let's let's just tahan a bit
like you know there's you people say macam uh there's like there's a
or apa the rainbow comes first something like that lah I forget I lupa
it became forty minutes what the hell and then I like sesat sia I was like so I was so stressed I scared simon angry cause I make I always make him wait
like what if he marah at me and he doesn't want to hang out with us anymore
uh he's kinda mad at me about that like merajuk he merajuk he kata
like cause during the weekends err weekdays tak dapat jumpa then weekend also like I also busy
we were hang up till five and then uh I went home and then I woke up at like twelve then I called him and ask him if he wanted to come along and he say ya he wants to come along but he says but he's like half-awake so I was like never mind lah you just sleep I'll go with sharinah and simon and then after that I tell him lah then after that I want to do my school stuff abeh he macam like upset
then I also macam like annoyed lah pasal he yesterday he cakap he nak hantar you know like he want to fetch me and send me here like and then last minute he say like last minute he like still sleeping then I like ah fuck it lah I'm just going go myself then I don't know so that was a bad start to the day
no lah I tell him already I I sampai then he never reply
oh oh there's one the nice one the one the dua tingkat right
what's what does simon want to do nak buat apa
then you kena tunggu ah how long was the simulation
ah that's not bad tak tunggu lama ah
I mean even when you're not influenced even if you're not drunk tak mabuk you still cannot predict what that's so funny
cause they already like nak masakkan you then is that it
you makan apa seh kat situ azizi still got
he buncit already meh
ah pasal dia punya percentage for exams is the they um turunkan for exams so they put it at every other uh like assignments quizzes so they increase the percentage there so it's heavier for the assignment than quizzes it used to be like five percent now the quizzes are like ten percent that's whole grade leh babe
so like I have to do properly lah then I taking I taking four modules sia babe like fucking busy I'm so sorry for saying that word but but I'll be so busy tak ada time
ya so I'm telling aqil like I'm gonna be busy I tak ada time for him sometimes like for during the weekdays
he gets it tapi dia pun sedih ah sometimes
ah dia macam kalau I boleh buat you pun boleh buat gitu ah
ya I think gitu ah
lain ah lain I cannot sia like he that time he also he only one module lah then I got four modules
cause the other day he was asking me eh err do you have lobang for like then it's like aiya syrinah boleh cari sendiri ah but like you know the previous place I worked at the dyslexia association of singapore they they paying quite high oh now lah
ya it's macam learning centre punya timing ah but it's lepak ah the job is it's damn lepak
no babe it will like strain your body sia then you want to have baby camne nak have a baby if you're gonna be tired all the time
then you can just hantar him lah
tinggal mana seh babe
that's so freaking far from dari bishan pergi choa chu eh pergi his ah camp is kat mana
like you beg her that's what I would do I would pujuk her I'll cium her kaki sia to kasi the bilik
it's like girl I'll get you an iphone and ipad anything you want just let me have the room five days a week you just live in the hall for five days a week a few nights a week and then on the weekends you can have it wah susah sia tak ada rumah sendiri I swear it's damn hard
wah then must tahan like this for satu tahun
no wonder simon kata want to get his own car the other day
it's not cheap sia babe tu hari I tolong top up kan aqil punya minyak cause he was driving me around so I offered to bayar for the minyak ah I only kasi fifty dollars and it's like
what the hell it's so mahal sia their minyak the fuel consumptions is like shit
it's mahal as shit man I swear it's like honestly bike
like I I tengok also if like
and it's all the way at the lim chu kang there sia what bus will pergi sana
tak payah lah oh my god you know what I think right it's a good thing that you're not working right now because you can like hantar simon
sleep in or you know not the one to trouble you but kesian sia he he like I also will think like
but it's only like um august september october november lima lima bulan jer tinggal then after that you guys can like like breathe a little right
the doa the berkat the berkat from the family like you know like another I don't know lah to me doesn't matter as long as got I don't need my makciknya berkat it's okay god sees me and god loves me so that's fine
I feel like as long as ya I feel like if you're pregnant tak yah sudah it's like forgo the whole idea but since you're not pregnant you know planning planning
right so are they agreeable to return you the duit after kalau in december tak boleh hold a wedding are they going to return the money
but that like dengki sia
oh masih tu ah
I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything tau you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to uh and then you also include like you you um macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how sia you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects lah like you still going to lose money sia
and at this time leh macam
macam like you lost thousands of money eh just because like orh the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
it's not even your fault sia it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been uh how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
I told aqil I had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin ah but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time ah cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi I tak nak macam okay I need to find a man yang I boleh kahwin no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will uh fall into place lah like if if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately I feel like uh it's important that aqil and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting ah of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan ah
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi um
so he say ah like let's celebrate or officiate um hujung tahun
tapi kan babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I nak tengok your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all ugh in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
oh right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I macam oh then he cakap ah actually dia dah start saving like he's very uh thrifty like
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
then I was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish I um
I know like I know he's an adult like I know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
so like I was so sure of hassan ah I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him oh my god okay I nak bilang you something ah yesterday yesterday semalam I told aqil this I say I cakap dengan aqil um
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things um tertulis ah lah like is everything tertulis what like
belum I belum delete I still I still masih ada kat phone
dekat my phone
kenapa I tak tahu I tak tahu asal I tak delete
I I tak nak tengok ah the gambar-gambar like it makes
kau nak but
that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
lepas tu um dah kahwin after a few after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
cakap melayu lah okay so itu saja tentang hassan
ah tentang hassan dan aqil
oh I still macam sedih seh you and simon tak pergi honeymoon
the thing yang I akan look forward to right
thai pancake sedap dok thai pancake
ya but krabi punya water activities mm lame juga ah
I nak ikut I nak ikut mak dan ayah
tak boleh itu honeymoon
okay abeh atas I tell my parents I go with you then over there we separate
then kat sana kita separate
kalau pergi krabi
ah ah kita I tell
I tell my parents that I go dengan you then kat kat sana then I separate lah dengan aqil lah
no tapi nak buat like you can do your own things boleh buat benda sendiri boleh
lepak jer water activities makan lepak
you don't like macam buat activity
tapi macam sightseeing pergi like hiking pergi like um visit temples and shit
I'm okay to like shop like maybe half a day or like two hours or three hours kalau the whole day nak pergi shopping I boring seh like bosan gila
macam restless as err especially if like I tak cause I don't really like shop much
if I don't have anything that I like then boring gila seh
I feel like kita should go
buat anak dekat bali
uh kalau kita empat pergi bali aqil dengan I kita pergi uh ee kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
orh yesterday um we saw aqil ah class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend oh my god the girlfriend cantik gila sia I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like uh ya melayu but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like macam like I say hi ah but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then aqil was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
because right babe when we duduk in the car aqil need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
I am not complaining ah cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I tak complain lah pasal I pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so up to you lah you nak on aircon I okay jer you nak waste nak waste gas
but I think one thing that I need to like um get used to is dia punya cemburu
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila I cakap pasal like my guy friends or like shah shah sia shah is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam oh maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
like to me it's like uh old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that one I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything lah between you
I punya timer five three two eight
orh pasal aqil tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard ah to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like oof damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full lah
so macam
especially practising muslim so macam like ah but macam I have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian ah like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like I don't wanna ya so like macam oh okay like that's your view too
gasak kau lah nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so I tak kesah ah dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa I nak tegur you know
so I think part yang dia like in terms of I'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on aqil like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will I scared they feel like aqil is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair lah pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I yang nak kahwin pe
I think my my parents punya fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life lah like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
macam tak sincere jer
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning lah like properly macam
apply for house then like um because aqil just started working so his is tak banyak
I feel like I feel like aqil is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia tau dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe
a'ah lama seh tak jumpa
my work cancel ah pasal COVID
tengah cari kerja ah ah
because dulu I kerja macam
events gitu lah then events semua macam
tak ada events gitu so
tak apa lah
ada skillsfuture semua you know
um dekat ah yang lain semua mahal ah
you sekolah apa ah
I uh that time I a bit scared ah because macam COVID still a lot kan
ya tak tak keluar tak kerja tak anything
eh you kerja apa again
oh gitu
irritating kan macam kerja berat sangat gitu nak buat like you know
tak ada mood eh
duduk office right ya a'ah
but either way I don't like to work at home then your your your school pun home based juga ke apa
always all the way like that ke pasal COVID
I'm already malas because like the first
two month you know circuit breaker I really tak keluar rumah
then uh ya then after that then it was so hard to go out again macam
tak tak jadi circuit breaker circuit baker tak
siapa kisah uh nevermind lah like that time I was so bored
like I make the the you know the brown sugar pearl then the dalgona coffee semua I make
tak ada kerja ah
ya tapi tak jadi ah some some some okay some
ya some success then some is like macam
tak jadi ah then I'm try to make apam balik but it's like
not that nice like pasar malam kind
tak apa ah
oh wow but I don't like to order kat luar because like
actually I eat macam benda yang tak halal ah macam no pork no lard I just makan you know
ya lah ya lah like kalau keluar kan boleh like choose whatever I want to eat you know
apa tinggal mana ang mo kio
oh ya that one also aku ada story
eh but jurong okay what I don't know I mean at least when I go there kan macam
a whole new world for me ah like macam tak biasa at all ah but then ya I used to like cause I was thinking macam jurong kan ada
banyak ah ya so it's like whenever I go there then tak tau nak makan apa ya so
ya maybe that's why we never like meet each other because you always there but then you go town a lot kan kerja and school
tak keluar juga ya lah ya lah
uh you know mister teh tarik gitu ah
gitu lah
rajin like more rajin in the kitchen right
then my mum was like oh bila nak kahwin you know things like that
I tempted you know because recently dia orang kata uh like
majlis like only ten people or something
ya apa ni
but you attached or tak
I see some of the comments kat facebook kan dia orang kata macam
dah dah dah lima then groomsmen like lagi lima orang
that's why then I was like patut lah
ya then they were like macam bising ah like uh
uh with my majlis perkahwinan then I'm just like
tak tak faham ah
tak tahu ah the name semua macam sama gitu I don't know ya
you boleh drive tak
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like oh hi welcome to apa apa apa you know then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask what then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous ke apa lah
you don't want to tegur like that then you just like alamak dia ni lagi then
oh oh ya ya ya ya ya ya betul tak tak sombong ah nanti dia cakap sombong then you know cause usually never wear wear the mask then they'll be like
uh eh you very sombong eh sekarang like then I'm like
you penat kerja then you just like you know zone out and then you just walk home or something but then sometimes I bumped into them then I never see then dia orang kata I like macam
sekarang dah sombong eh what what what then I'm just like what you know so
now wear mask bedek-bedek oh tak perasan lah like you know like ya but I understand what you mean by rimas also I think that one is just because singapore is hot
nak snow tak nak ah that one kiamat already
actually I don't know whether I want to still work with them I like recently I got like macam change of heart
dah tua ah like macam tiring ah events
my friend dia nak jadi temperature screener kan dekat kedai tu kan
then dia orang kata mesti ada diploma then I'm like
susah sangat ke temperature screener you know like apa seh
tak makes sense ah I think dia orang macam sengaja nak
buat susah you know then they complain like you know oh nobody want to apply padahal
tapi the people like freaking toxic seh then I cannot take it then I just like say like I don't want to come back
kerja apa uh teaching
ah tak but I got um biasa ah tuition experience and like you know
I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom gitu
ya then apa lagi eh uh
ya then now also like nak classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like macam
every hour kena sanitise gitu ah like ugh
then macam malas gitu ah
ya but this one dia toxic ah the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay lah cuma the management ah like macam
ngada-ngada ah I don't know how to say
then like the first three days the management tak datang so I'm like okay ah this job like not bad ah I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like macam
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but boleh lah can manage lah you know not so
um tengok how I work lah you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then dia orang
ya she damn cari pasal ah like with me like semua benda yang I buat which I think is like
not even her problem dia macam tak okay
then I like malas already then ya then like
if I know everything why I training right like bodoh pe perempuan ni
uh then then I know what he what they she roughly mean ah I don't get like everything but I boleh faham sikit-sikit ah
aku baru then aku tak tahu apa-apa you know things like that then I'm like
or is it the next day or something like that then she like tegur me ah she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like eh kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa then kau orang nak test aku
I know how to do lah gitu so I managed to pass the test lah then she was like okay actually um I think you can
uh you don't know anything so I uh that time I'm just like malas seh nak datang balik
you want kira work from home ah I don't want seh
but then now I I see like macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay lah I guess
my friends semua macam introvert dengan homebody juga so it was quite fun lah for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other macam
you ask them to jumpa right like like
too wild too long in that's why I'm like macam
but then my parents dia orang macam nak my sis my younger sister to marry first
tak ah I think my relationship longer but my relationship uh I'm also attached to a non-muslim
ya it makes things more complicated ah I guess then my sister she macam
she attached dengan muslim guy so that's already one
macam sekarang right I was thinking like is it
marriage is just like macam
eh but then you know what so scary leh like macam
um recently kan I baca kat
facebook ah now now got a lot of free time what so more time to browse facebook gitu semua
wah then ah so if cause to me right macam kalau kita relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
need lawyer need to sign things all macam ugh malas ah
uh tak I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know rajin-rajin in the kitchen then dia orang macam
oh um izzati finally can get married gitu you know but then I'm just like
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much kalau tahu I just
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun lah but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant gitu you know
like chiongster also lah kerja banyak and things like that then my parents also not happy ah because like
supposedly twenty five kita kena dah married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off lah
mm mm betul lah then what huh
kita pun ada cakap ah like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
then she say it's like hell lah because the mother in-law macam
like have a lot of expectations of her gitu
but sometimes kecoh is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of kecoh
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she cakap dia tak nak ah she nak cari rumah sendiri juga
like you know hari raya you pergi like rumah kat jurong then mesti ada kucing punya I don't know ah I don't know how to say ya
I never say ah bukan aku cakap eh
oh pergi pasir ris then I oh pergi changi okay then pergi jurong ah I
seram seh
oh but recently my sister kena then I was like what the hell
a bit overconfident lah dia orang kata
so so it's like I'm like oi uh why you follow me like you know padahal I'm just a
sometimes dia orang will follow from a distance which I can still like macam
buat bodoh lah you know then
there was one guy who even like macam
naik kan then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
and actually because I want to lean ah because I malas
recently kan I feel like macam I want to move to the west side because
ya so it's like macam I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
life you know like sometimes the the kerja is like so far away from your rumah then it's like ugh malas ya
so ya lah ya lah macam I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't uh what
ya lah cause in ang mo kio like macam nobody ever sleeps
then sometimes like three kan ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon then dia orang ketawa like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
because he also still studying then he want to like uh like what you say lah macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu
sebab dia nak jadi teacher so now he studying the subject
because he wants to work at punya kind of school
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't kerja you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
say before that he is macam
like when he got school kan dia nak
uh but then that semester break it I think is is macam charity

saya punya earpiece uh low battery
the haprak ah the airpods
haprak sis airpods
tak boleh harap airpod
kalau my earpiece die I pause for a while lah must pause okay sis
but we left one minute but my earpiece I know arwah it's gonna die soon
I'm so hungry lah alah I want to go and makan I don't care after this
amazing ah I cakap dalam bahasa melayu
macam I know from your face
uh huh uh my one no need to enter the room my cahaya know is um dari dari my muka dah macam everybody look everybody like I need nili lah I need nili I no need torchlight what is torchlight
a'ah sis I wanna makan soon
the job punya name if I'm not wrong it was apa tu
it should be ah or siapa-siapa yang boleh faham ah melayu
ya but the job punya
the job punya description wah was not that not that bad uh
transcriptions oh sorry err listen to audio punya files
no I think it's like maybe macam punya type of thing uh
ya ya basically ah but I think there's also another aspect of macam
err natural language processing punya
because kan you know ada ada debate kan whether language is
err nature or nurture macam whether there is a biological foundation for language
the brain punya mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke tak whether the can learn
because my results kan belum keluar
if I apply then like a bit weird uh but I'm quite sure I will pass lah so I think tak ada hal kalau nak apply jer
special education punya teacher
because I fall into the macam the
only one exam was quite difficult uh the other three macam
gitu-gitu jer uh okay ah I did two of them quite well err
but at the same time kalau dia rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest punya score possible
oh so macam what are your strengths what are your weaknesses gitu ah
wait he got cut off oh because the break up room punya time was ending
sebarang jer siol leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the benda ni compulsory kan
belajar belajar all the way like for hours and hours straight
for the eighteenth century punya lit
it's work for me throughout the four years uh for all my lit punya courses ah plus I hate lit uh so
biar lah dia
tak menyibuk lah dia
left maksud
oh kejap pause
but the appointment pukul enam pagi
nak kena siap apa seh you just need to go over to the location pe
okay so he's not actually baru ah macam gitu
so so your shift doesn't deal with macam punya barang-barang ah
apa and oo
kirakan dia lost ah
kita orang macam chair destroyers eh
I mean even on your off days also most likely kena tidur kan
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift punya thing uh pasal dulu nasri pun bila dia tengah kerja shift
macam even on his off days his time was taken up by
tidur dulu because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
wait so so you mean different punya clients
I think especially because macam lain-lain punya organisation ada lain-lain punya processes
so macam
solid base to work from within your own organisational punya itu
like it's dependent on the client rather than the itu
what what do you mean kena macam tu eh apa
first come first serve siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu
pukul lima five in the morning
and you don't want to be the kind yang
tanya tanya tanya macam oi you want or not eh you want or not gitu
like I have a feeling like usually the one yang step up is you and not all all those other people yang itu
pasal kan ada apa budak baru nama jaden kan abeh seniors dia jaded
so jaden dengan jaded sama-sama
never mind never mind let them cringe janji janji kita punya audio dorang dapat
no no no it's like it's like bila kita orang dua orang jer berbual macam
kalau orang melayu apa ah
ada ada ada there's a there's a uh there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
macam like like ah is it
is it kayu tiga
I think it's kayu tiga
oh okay lah betul lah I mean we we're having
I mean maybe the design of dia punya blocks also plays a part lah
but at the same time tak kan you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time orang nak balik rumah
tak kan orang sia-sia jer ketuk-ketuk siol
banyak ah anime
weeaboo kalau melayu apa weeaboo
kalau indo weeaboo
part dia pun belum sampai dalam anime dia
they had they had to stop for a while pasal COVID
uh apparently january next year in japan lah tapi kat singapore belum tahu ah
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own macam
cinema punya based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of uh apa
err to do with the film ah let's say macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself abeh nanti macam
tak lawa ah dia punya tu
ya ya that's the thing macam kalau film it's like
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel punya density
like with digital all like you are constrained by dia punya
the pixels ah and the resolution that it was framed at ah macam you know lord of the rings
is because dia punya digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
takde ah but it weren't limited like if you if you film
but all the and the extra extra punya barang-barang
was err ten eighty P punya rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether apa tu
dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya effects
or whether dorang nak apa
err just use the existing punya rendering
and then upscale to four K tapi macam buruk ah macam zoom zoom in gitu ah that's the kind of effect
ah ya ya ya macam stretched gitu
tunggu ah dia
ah ya lah you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script macam mana dia punya scene develops
you know like the three quarter removed punya angle or like
macam the kubrick punya
stanley kubrick punya follow through the halls
no tak nak tak nak
tapi macam kenyang ah boleh ah Gong Cha
how to work the camera to achieve that itu
I think director director macam gitu is
dah successful dah ada banyak duit then
the ego that comes with it is itu uh
I think it can go anywhere ah doesn't necessarily have to be macam
horror or itu it can be like it can be like drama
the person and the nature of the person macam who are you gitu
macam telling you
the the thing that I like about the original punya jurassic park is
that that err that apa
it kind of moves beyond macam like what what constitutes
like how you know there was a scene of the guy yang dia dia
err apa ada T-rex
then after that dia abandoned budak-budak then after that dia terus dia lari masuk toilet then T-rex gigit kepala dia
it's like err macam
I only remember the beautiful shots of the itu
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also macam lawa gitu
it's very macam ethereal
I cannot remember but it was the director of pengabdi setan
but I I want to watch pengabdi setan ah where to watch ah
because I I took the scriptwriting punya course apa
you make the film I write the script dah settle ah
like next year because tu apa tu
like my monitor punya resolution terlalu tinggi for the for the card
so macam I need a stronger card
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm murah punya maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know rehan that time buy on sale thirty seven murah
that's why it's so macam itu
sebab I don't like it ah because all the mat reps semua macam tengok macam uh demon slayer demon slayer
boleh beli dari AliExpress pe
of the thing because it's actually dia macam
macam with real respect for people punya feelings and not just some
random rom com yang dorang macam sebarang rojak letak kat dalam ni semua abeh mix mix mix abeh
janji kelakar habis ah
but at the same time like you must also consider macam kat japan kan
yang the source material dorang punya manga ke
dia punya light novel ke visual novel ke pe
has to be actually very popular dalam its own format
or sampah habis
different ke
so sahaja jer ah dia ambil
oh dia muda eh
husband dia singaporean pe
oh abeh dia just dapat kerja kat sini ah
maybe dia punya dia tak kasi basis book tak suka ah
wait dia tinggal kat mana
as in as in in indonesia dia tinggal kat mana
boleh eh
try uh nanti
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time eh kita kita cari korean punya movie
wait so so far your your korean punya tu sampai tahap apa
as in like dia punya apa tu
boleh understand adult punya language ke
macam hyperinflation
came first sebelum writing
dia punya shine through lawa tak
oh macam too good to be true gitu ya
ah ya I mean it's not lucky lah it should fit because it's all out punya key cap apa
nak buat apa five year aku tak tahu aku cakap macam oh definitely I want to excel in my career meaning that I wanna be moving up the ladder not just in terms of management role lah but you know like also like macam okay if this is something that I have never done before so that to me is also a progression right or if let's say
I was like apa seh nak cakap
I aspire to inspire kau nampak kau nampak
yes so ah I had like three interviews and then um so this is what for it's like so as in I got three interviews err no was it three I think I I had three interviews and two follow up post yes yes yes from the same company so um I felt that macam this company is kan and and
I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know err where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like macam like siala I want go interview but I scared sia yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where macam um aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain then bila aku cari kerja lain I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that macam
very much so yes okay lah no look my training ground is actually quite far tapi aku aku fikir panjang kan dia cakap five year plan kan aku fikir five plan dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun okay
yes my new colleague tell me okay okay we will see you become like reach this position in five years I just no lah no lah no lah satu tahun then coming july dua tahun
cepat juga kan I feel like macam wah all the job demands macam I'm like just taking in everything so it's good that you when this new colleague masuk kan beberapa macam
berlega sikit lah hati aku tak payah banyak sangat buat macam everything is on me you know and some more yes but when he ask me like oh like you want to become a we have a senior position at my workplace in the next few years I'm not sure you know having the having my own local brand
but I really wanted that tengah estate house get the the sales of balance flats if I get it the house will be ready in may twenty twenty two twenty twenty three because it was the first few launch yes the one that they released in november as in recently the house will only be ready in twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five jauh seh
because my fiance dia tak ada passion nak pergi sangat to get a house planning or let's say we'll see how
not not like what's in it for you but more of macam
uh role in terms of career wise I'm like in redeem kan so I used to be in right and then now I'm in like mass production retail so people it's funny macam we see that aspect of people who like I don't want to buy ah you know I want to save money ah now now tough time lah cannot spend lah
and and we haven't had a lot of okay lately there have been a few chinese tourists tourists bukan bukan local aku takut
boleh bah certain certain countries can come in singapore already what
so macam like a the same thing lah okay yes I I hear the same thing you know like now cannot lah no cannot spend lah now err must save money you know market very bad financial very bad blah blah blah blah blah but your bill can go up to like what five six hundred dollars
average family probably would have one lah fashion jenama big brand it's like that two iconic brand lah orang queue lah kat luar uh uh okay you know and chanel
orang people queue lah sia kat luar people queue people queue outside and these are some of the people who queues outside their store come up to my stores with paper bags of their stores and come to my store asking me eh got discount walao eh you buy eh you buy chanel then come to my store and then ask me for discount
yes but you can always cancel but you can always cancel your subscription apa in subscription
oh yes okay okay okay boleh boleh boleh easy easy easy
yes yes yes so um the job requirements it macam let's say err you you of course your duty is only in the office lah you know you know you don't have to go like you don't have to go out onto on on the floor but let's say if they need assistance on the floor then they will ask you to help lah
while I use my weekends but now I have my weekends and all the public holidays there are I don't care aku rasa betul tu
kena saya macam kentang uh kan
macam mana terisik aku macam kat situ jer this could be a big break right
of course oh my god tadi ramai gila because people got nowhere else to go kau nak pergi mana now there's no holidays right so usually families would go on holidays with the kids spend time but now people cannot travel anywhere what
well food is life so what aku rasa challenge is right
because I work shifts I cannot be bothered to shop cause tired and also the job is quite demanding physically also you just like like like today oh my god penat gila bro

I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online lah for me ah cause aku rasa kalau if show everything online nanti kalau kau orang break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing it's weird I I don't know how you all do it like kau orang just post pictures of each other and stuff like that I'll I'll feel weird doing that I guess it's just not me ah

K ada satu jer aku tengok
apa eh
tujuh hari eh tujuh hari mencintai mu is it
aku rasa lah aku pun tak sure
serious satu jer
satu jer the rest I don't like it
dulu what
dulu kita tengok drama together what because there is timing for it what
kan aku pun selalu tengok suratkhabar just to tengok apa show yang ada for the day
and bila nak buka and bila tak payah buka at all
aku tengok that this one facebook post I think aku pun lupa bila
like that's when dia orang tahu that perempuan is actually lelaki they went for
they went for service punya
ya I mean in singapore it's called other countries I don't know but for service ni
seriously dia orang semua like most of the guys seriously they really look like a freaking girl
aku seriously seh
macam dah pernah eh
I mean mostly of my friends who have tunang
siapa boleh kasi aku attention wise
aku faham aku faham tapi kaucara kau cakap is like
because it's very different it's very different bila kau tengok eh everything it's all scripted what
that's why it relieves your stress level bila kau tengok cerita tu
cam kau get excited
so ada so ada voting punya ni lah
tak semua I watch bondi rescue
kau tau eh aku tengok that bondi rescue thirteen season it's to the point that aku cakap ngan mak aku nak jadi lifeguard
uh bondi rescue is like mm kau lifeguard so basically you just jaga this beach kau
no they are just on their job basis so basically this cameramen just come in just shooting their everyday punya
no but you know it's very how to say ah macam
macam dia puaskan hati kau tau yang bila diorang actually
inspire me ya something like that because aku tengok kan this one season kan they diorang fail to apa tu uh save this couple tau old couple
they are in their seventies kalau tak salah aku they only managed to save
dia ada tiga orang this couple dengan lagi satu diorang punya kirakan in-laws lah
kirakan adik ipar is it aku pun tak sure
ah betul lah abang ipar lah tu
melayu fail
so basically diorang bila diorang dah save this tiga orang kan no diorang save satu aje dahulu because lifeguards kat situ empat orang in duty
three of them just go there and save kalau ada orang drown lagi how
diorang nangis actually because they couldn't save
diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu kan
aku nangis because aku tengok diorang actually trying to revive that that couple back
really diorang really like went all out
betul ah
that's why they cry because they try so hard tapi they try to actually macam cover themself up ah because diorang tahu kan diorang being
tapi banyak orang like surrounding diorang macam like kind of like macam blaming them for not doing their job properly macam couldn't rescue them on time
kau imagine eh kerja kau as a lifeguard kau ada empat like only four of you and you expect them to rescue all of you who are drowing which is to me pada aku is just so sad
oh kesian kan
kan that's why aku I wanted to be at that one point of time ah because aku really aku admire diorang punya how to say ah macam diorang punya semangat untuk kerja
kau tahu eh after that that three lifeguard eh two lifeguard took a long leave because they were was ah because they were affected by that thingy
abeh ada satu lagi that one episode before diorang habis tu season
yang satu budak ni actually dia carik bapa dia tau for three hours kat beach tu beach tu memang besar gila ah
dia ada north south
ah K basically K you get the point lah eh dia punya laut besar
dia cari bapa dia tiga jam pastu last dia pergi that tower where all the lifeguard is there dia cakap uh apa aku tengah cari bapa aku boleh tak buat announcement
yang kau tahu yang this one lifeguard actually cakap yang tadi aku try save this one old lady
aku try to save this one guy but then by the time aku sampai kepala dia dah takde
ya he wasn't sure at all itu orang ke batu
tak save because dia tak tak boleh cari
because diorang save is pakai board tau
pakai diorang diorang sendiri swim
surfing surfing board tu diorang sendiri pergi
K lah after that bila budak tu patah balik eh diorang punya mindset is all the lifeguard kalau selagi takde datang kat sini cari orang kirakan itu is batu bukan orang it's a good thing
dia tak move then after that bila budak tu datang dia cakap aku dah cari bapa aku dah tiga jam
semua orang got called out because they had to do a search in that laut
they they went there for holiday but then it ended up and the saddest thing is kau tahu on that day he died it was his birthday
aku nangis aku seriously mak dia dah pengsan anak dia dah kirakan nak jadi the strong pillar for the mother
he just stand there ah just wait for someone to actually bawak body dia masuk
aku emotional lah
itu dah lama seh
eh but diorang punya joke is very far how to say eh it's very
kau nak kene really like tangkap that to to actually understand
it's kelakar pada aku kelakar gila no okay dia punya joke is very
kau nak kene really understand
what if you watch properly you will understand that diorang punya joke is really mendalam
cam it's just inside joke
kalau if you get it you laugh if you don't get it you dont laugh you know that kind of shit
pada aku lah it's fun lah

tapi diorang main-main jer kan
kau serious ah you are the oldest
naik basikal I see the cuaca today like hot only
I need to wear face masks right now sekarang dengan COVID nineteen ni semua
oh the kain yang macam instructor when they do instructors when they do camp they wear that buff mask right that kind that oh ya okay okay
tadi that time you told me before lah apa you cakap you you cycling abeh ada benda go into your mouth is it
susah nak nak bernafas lah ni
lalat as in ah as in lalat as in housefly
but a lalat the black flying buzzing thing
you swallowed you went to swallow ah the housefly sedap tak
so you were cakap orang cakap apa ni perfectly fine ah after you accidentally swallowed a housefly
the oh ya true true ada tempat yang
err ya I mean ada tempat
entah mana lah suka they they love to makan all these maggots spiders all these weird weird apa binatang ni semua
no no I I don't I don't want to eat all these any weird animals eh you said you you ride bicycle eh datang sini
and you tengah ambil your motorbike licence right are you oh yes
kat mana where you take where you taking ah
and kalau you naik motorbike if I'm not wrong lah if I'm not wrong err if you work under foodpanda dia punya gaji lebih kan sepuluh dollar per hour I think
tapi I think I got some friends who are under
who are under foodpanda dia orang I ada tanya lah I ask them eh how much gaji bagus tak if you work with foodpanda as part time and stuff and they say it it's not bad lah actually like I think they have the for foodpanda if I'm not wrong they have the
hourly rate and then if within that one hour you boleh hantar banyak makanan they call it docket if I'm not wrong
so if you can hantar more food means you earn more dockets and there's ada macam bonus lah kasih dia orang happy sikit kasih the riders happy sikit
macam competing lah
oh okay tapi if I'm not around kan ah kadang-kadang if the customer happy you bawa
their their makanan cepat-cepat then they will boleh kasih you tip eh
tapi tengok lah tapi ada orang kasih ke tak
okay okay okay tapi ah what's the
what's the paling banyak ah orang kasih your tip
macam paling banyak tip one time they give you one big tip ada tak
one customer kasih give you ah ten dollar tip
wah very good ah but oh ya your bicycle I see I like so terkejut no I follow my friends semua nak beli basikal I thought lah I ingat one bicycle maybe
sixty dollars ke hundred dollars ke but
and we can you imagine you tengah hantar makanan orang tengah tunggu at the house waiting where is my food alamak then find out the the rider bicycle pancit or the wheel
ah pecah ke apa then like quite wasted lah if you buy a cheap very cheap kind of bicycle
oh ya lah dia punya drivers kalau nampak orang bicycle they will try to try to apa tu drive very near to the bicycle ya lah I mean I know that you all want to rush for more orders means more money but then sometimes terlupa that eh you guys are on the road
and there are buses ada apa tu lorry ada motorcycles semua so next time just be more careful lah tengok lah before you pusing you tengok apa apa tu blind spot check back check back eh check back whether there any vehicles around you ah
okay okay then you tadi morning you told me you were taking your motorbike practical also right kat where again kat mana the ubi ubi eunos there right is it
ah so you macam tahu lah apa dia punya dangers and stuff
so next time when you dah dapat license your motorbike licence ke car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see eh got one cyclist coming or eh got one cyclists behind me you know lah to be more careful
eh wait wait that means you on which practical five eh lima
ah okay okay okay before oh ya prac five yang you have to do everything in the circuit then kalau pass prac six then only can go out at the road
uh okay tapi one thing about ubi eh cause I took my license there at ubi also
that dulu lah dulu lah when I when I took my license apa tu ubi ah very crowded so you just be very careful lah kalau especially when you first time keluar naik road
because I know some of my kawan they took the license motorbike licence kat
the one yang kat the one yang kat mana woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there sunyi ah quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded macam kat ubi so I think for them was macam lagi senang to pass the test lah test
you naik basikal to ubi
oh you tak ambil public transport
orh okay okay okay then for you kalau dari hougang want to cycle to woodlands itu dah penat bro
by the time you want to start your lesson at woodlands you already penat you cannot really ride the motorbike motorbike ride you I think I don't know whether motorbike would go then later you kena scolding from all instructors
tapi I think one practical how much is it now
dua puluh eh dua puluh lebih
oh yes yes as you I think as you naik naik uh as you progress the cost of course lah dah lagi more mahal
kalau you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's lagi more mahal lah as you go along this
but when do you think you will get your license though boleh beli motorbike boleh naik motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
lagi that day yang kat ah news north west line the major ah blackout alamak itu dia orang during bila peak period and then the red line the green line dengan dia punya yellow line sekali breakdown
ya but ah apa tu when you when you dah pass eh which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero itu kan the tuning training centre punya motorbike eh tak
oh you can get cause I know my friends yang sekarang tengah pakai they say it's err fuel efficient dapat jimat duit sikit
atau kalau you banyak duit sangat kan you boleh beli those err more expensive motorbike yang macam triumph
triumph or ah the one I paling suka when I see people riding on the motorbike uh royal enfield
oh but you don't want to buy a first hand punya motorbike eh
wah and then kalau you tak ada here for six months then who going to use your bike cause you need to always someone needs to start start your motorbike right you cannot leave it err sleeping for too long period
but I mean the transport transports sekarang tak boleh reliable sangat lah sekarang
tapi I would say that the transport has he has been getting better lah dulu I think a few years back three or four years back ada this one period of time macam every week confirm plus chop ada breakdown every week confirm ada
breakdown lah ada yang
the travelling time was too long ada jer problem kadang-kadang but I would say now is much better lah they're doing a much better job but but having said that masih boleh improve that they can still improve so that's my take
the best surprise eh yang I paling dapat uh
ini many years ago lah eh many many years ago when a for my twenty first birthday selamat hari jadi eh my twenty first birthday ah my kawan-kawan kaki bola my soccer mates want to throw me a birthday
ya so I remember that time masih masih bulan ramadan that time when we were still fasting and then my birthday fell within that month lah
then err they chose this place namanya is called mark's place the one at eunos they wanted to belanja me dinner then okay I was like okay sure ah then I went down
they book the table for seven so senang lah bila time buka we all boleh makan together right
so I came down I was so excited lah kirakan eh I went there at about pukul berapa eh I went six thirty so I sat there and I was the first to come I was the first to arrive so okay I duduk I duduk there at the table
then I duduk I tunggu tunggu tunggu for my friends nobody turn up tak ada orang datang
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know ada because the place where I tengah duduk uh is facing the road
so I saw this one kereta just drive past tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak jer this kereta then I noticed dia punya driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
oh by the way kita tak makan kat sini I tengok them they tengok me and then I still remember other tables
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like terkejut sikit lah eh asal tiba-tiba want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then err so they blindfolded me so when I masuk the kereta I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me diam-diam and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location lah location yang I sendiri tak tahu so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the dia punya pintu
I can hear the pintu buka but when the pintu buka also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car dah park and then my kawan-kawan say okay now you can uh get off the car so of course ada orang pimpin my tangan cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into longkang or something
ah okay then I just ikut I just pimpin my friend tangan they brought me to a unknown location ah next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
kita kat marina barrage
ya oh if I remember correctly tak salah there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they letak uh picnic mat they letak uh fairy lights and they prepared some makanan like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were err tengah puasa time tengah puasa I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks ada bawa uh game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice lah like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
yang paling best uh lepas kita dah makan dah sing song uh perut dah kenyang and then err one of them pass me a birthday present
and nasib is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a kasut nike like this specific kasut yang
was quite mahal lah actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this kasut that I think was about dua ratus lebih this pair of nike shoes
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will tanya the person first like oh apa yang you nak you want a teddy bear ke you want
you want if motorbike cannot lah I not that kaya so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack boleh lah if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time bila aku dalam kereta macam eh
takkan they want to kidnap me takkan they want to hantar me to johor bahru or put me in a abandoned house or something ada lah there was a period of time I was like asal kereta ni macam suddenly so quiet eh like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my apa ke tu ah kawan-kawan kaki bola so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents eh
because sometimes I don't want to belikan orang tu a present that they might not want or atau present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like oh okay what do you want for your birthday lah or it's either I buy for them uh
vouchers like it can be macam adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers ah pergilah kau apa kau nak beli
I know kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal can buy err gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually lah girls I think lagi senang to to buy presents for compared to a guy
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I tak suka kalau macam
uh big uh birthday bash macam ada orang kan they especially kalau
twenty one birthday they will have their macam nak glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite macam kawan dia nenek dia cousin dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang like I tak suka that kind of stuff lah
kawan-kawan rapat lah so is good thing that they didn't throw a big uh big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like kalau anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
and also kalau macam banyak sangat orang especially kalau invite banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang you tak kenal atau orang yang that you barely talk to so you macam tak nak awkward lah then kalau banyak sangat orang also later you have to
you have to split your time with err different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you kena go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having macam a very good time and macam shiok sendiri
and I so I feel like kalau like you want to have a this macam grand gestures right you need to kena fikir where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until macam sakit kepala lah you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance kalau you want to do like
tempat mahal-mahal macam hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you kena book
ah makanan I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue nak kena fikir pasal uh makanan
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to fikir oh what entertainment do you want I mean kalau you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay lah then you can like lepak don't have to
if you gonna dapat orang birthday planner or something like that then you kena bayar this birthday planner pakai duit lagi
oh ya I mean like quite true eh tadi you cakap pasal if your birthday on macam twenty fifth december ke or macam your birthday is on err
thirty first december where's the peak period macam banyak orang confirm nak nak book err tempat macam want to book the hotels dekat dekat dengan the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder lah I would say or even if your birthday falls uh during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and susah to dapat all this uh bookings and stuff
and also kalau macam some people macam tak nak celebrate dia punya birthday kat singapore nak pergi overseas ke apa nak pergi batam
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu plane tickets semua tapi sekarang bila time macam gini
nobody saw it coming macam time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more gerek lah if you can celebrate your birthday in bali or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more gerek sia
like I think for me kalau if I can choose eh where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that tempat banyak sheeps ah new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a tempat for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside boleh apa tu feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
err kambing so at least when you go places like new zealand especially dia punya countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of uh
natural activities like apa tu yang kat river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
uh nice nice mountains and of course dia punya cuaca also lain lain from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times dapat juga some snow you pernah pergi new zealand eh
tapi kalau uh japan japan nak cari
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food punya lah susah and
it was not readily available so you have to do your macam homework lah before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to makan halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food boleh dapat at food court you can dapat your halal food at a hawker centres which are all semua dekat dekat boleh jalan so there the
their are halal food ah is different different locations and you have to go and find it in orang jepun they don't really speak english so kalau nak berbual you probably have to use ah the app google translate to help you out
oh the place I went mana eh I went to their
uh tokyo so tokyo was tokyo honestly dia macam singapore lah macam banyak sangat orang it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of jepun that I would like to visit err I will go further up north
err pergi hokkaido I think hokkaido also lagi tempat dia will be more sejuk and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to pernah pergi tak hokkaido
so I think kalau if you don't want to go jepun another place that I pernah pergi also err south korea like at least south korea you know lah people there dia punya complexion semua cantik-cantik
semua the people there their are complexion all putih-putih and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of err herbal food dia punya makanan is very different from singapore like our singapore diet kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai err makanan yang very oily but there in korea their food
and they always like to eat their favorite kimchi so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more kacak and cantik lah actually
oh ya because their their location have err what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located dekat equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure uh countries yang ada four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to ah further up north
places macam err sweden ke or you go to norway or finland if you tengok their completion putih macam letak bedak kind of putih
and err one thing kalau want to talk about uh going on vacation and stuff I think one err important aspect about going to vacation is to naik kapal terbang like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this kapal terbang just to duduk inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
in a roller coaster when the plane dah nak takeoff atau the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID err introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the tempat economy
so maybe I will decide nak tengok nak pergi ke tak but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing lah that you can get to travelling during this
err COVID situation will you go for this err parked err makan
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong lah is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly kalau nak fikir pasal six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation kat sentosa ke or I can use that money for
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december dah nak dekat
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher lah to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since orang kat luar cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
next week kau start ni kan apa ah volunteer eh
kat mana ni kau pergi where is it
orientation online macam mana what like what a lot of you meet macam gitu
ya lah this kind of volunteering betul betul betul betul betul I'm sure you can find something that you can do best you know macam that will fit you punya
chinese new year I think uh end jan apa
selalunya selalunya kan end jan
entah copywriting ya exactly maybe they should they will definitely make you guys to macam go on the ground isn't it macam distribute stuff no ah kau tak penat ke but they might ask you to do that no like be on the ground
penat ke apa engkau ke you know like you got to
how the hell would I know abeh macam you have to go on the ground like what if they ask you to like okay you go to the homes and distribute stuff
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the uh volunteers right so aku my my my volunteering with them is really fostering ah so I'm a rather than you know uh
it's a shelter the dogs are in kan kan is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what tengah ya tengah ya we are very close it's it's just next to choa chu kang ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter uh that involves dog walking
err cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then uh there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like macam they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this uh uh at this uh area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to macam
uh macam orang lalu-lalang kan then you macam talk about the awareness gitu lah which I wouldn't mind doing actually uh tapi sekarang uh we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that lah for being like you said lah because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker boleh lah cuma only you and the dogs tapi macam public all this awareness sort of stuff uh no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get uh emails pasal unit unit ambassadors and all that tapi now no more
ambassadors macam you you you macam you at the booth and you wear punya t-shirt uh you're next to the merchandise punya table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations punya uh apa ni uh tin tu kan and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do uh this is what we do as an and these are the cases macam gitu awareness of uh what does and how they can help oh they also have social uh pre-corporate social responsibility punya programs companies punya tu
so then you can do that uh they can say oh we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer ada volunteer macam photography
macam to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the gambar-gambar for the calendars so regular they need uh you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot lah I'm one of them
which I'm fostering for kucing I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
fosterer for puppies macam gitu so when they have cases then they contact you say okay wati we have this then
exactly kesian kan
you know lah kan international kan kan nama international punya brand kan so orang pun ada lah you know macam kasih donation gitu ada lah I think I guess they do have you know uh
uh but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad uh kita punya G O V takde kasih apa-apa
dia orang eh ini binatang-binatang kita orang tau daripada negeri ini mesti lah jaga sikit
ah that is the masalahnya tu
oh I think must there has to be some uh apa ni uh macam caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not lah macam of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas bukit batok lah banyak banyak macam jungle jungle apa they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know bukit batok has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the uh estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain uh authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out  you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
tengah mm mm mm
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out punggol pasir ris choa chu kang but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but takde collaboration kau faham tak takde supportive effort at all macam okay kau okay kita sekarang kita punya and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean kita nak buat macam gitu macam okay kita dia orang because dia orang uh yang boleh ambil I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and duit takde duit kan so siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu kan government kan so at least macam okay kita tolong collaborate lah you know uh okay uh kita buat ni then you all can uh kita boleh kasih kau orang support sikit-sikit untuk blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so apa yang buat sekarang is bila binatang ni keluar yang gahmen gahmen ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya itu yang kita boring
ya lah tapi not to this extent not to this extent look at tengah now tengah baru tengah is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because tengah is still around correct lim chu kang sekarang semua nak development punggol mana ada punggol dulu dulu mana ada waterway punggol sekarang dah ada punggol apa all the dogs from punggol are coming out you can you can literally walk on punggol street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs dulu mana ada because punggol was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because wah dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
the wild boar pun sama
betul exactly aku nak salahkan wild boar tu macam mana kesian pula so this is exactly what we are ini macam frustration lah kan
no gatal kau tengok aku punya ni rashes tapi aku memang sensitive skin
kau kulit kulit buaya
kau takde macam ni cover ni kan ni kan
abeh ada tulis arab ah
kena saman there's no such thing
I don't know about the saman part I know you that you kena saman if you litter
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue apa
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed makan makan makan ah dah habis okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they balik then patah balik dia orang patah balik then clear lah
kalau tidak it is considered littering
entah littering lah whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
town councils town councils um cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign lah dekat kat lift landing you know uh please keep clear within two hours macam gitu macam posters
bagus lah
block mana this block this block
kesian kan
macam back to macam back to nature eh
scout does I thought dia bawa kawan dia
ni depan ni eh
kesian eh
away from all the orang-orang
ya eh masa
macam what bila aku dekat uh botanic gardens aku kerja kat situ oh my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
oh they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them dia orang macam ada very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
uh I guess because botanic gardens kan ada lakes kan ada lakes ada eco lake swan lake and all the macam the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so uh when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so uh the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe macam ada bodyguard
ya dah macam they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though oh my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families dia macam different clans
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families macam different hello macam macam tigers kan lions kan ada different pride
sini ada so they have the kallang clan the kallang one which is like the the family that lives ya alah kau baca lah dalam surat khabar you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
ya they are macam a'ah they macam the hobbies gitu
ah yes they are watching the birds the ah okay yes macam gitu
mana ya alah of course lah they look the same mana lah aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the kallang clan
uh so the kallang clan otters are the ones that hang out in the kallang area dia macam territorial lah
maybe they are another clan but then again you know yang dekat yang dekat kallang tu wah I tell you
uh or the ones yang pergi kau tak baca dia masuk kat
ah gitu dengan tu that one is one clan know
ya eh dekat bishan park bishan park pun ada tau
you know macam they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
uh this is their territory kau masuk dalam territory dia orang boleh bergaduh
dia orang bukan macam um some canines some felines yang after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
I think uh tempat fishing punya people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think kallang I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook mati tau so sad
they macam they go to their mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana but they have their own spare trait lah kalau kau macam pergi dekat kallang river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
to be honest aku tak ingat sejak bila when is the first time they came out but otters ni tapi uh
uh both apa ni uh I don't know I don't know I don't remember when aku nak kencing I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly apa apasal aku toilet what do you mean I come back lah
ya cakap jer but I don't remember exactly when the otters um
uh I don't remember exactly when the otters you know keluar but definitely at least uh you know five years I think
bila bila aku start perasan ni lah when I first started you know noticed the news ah not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
masa kampung babe masa kampung-kampung dulu kan ada sungai-sungai otters nak pergi nak buat apa sekarang they're all where are they going to go
sama lah sama lah
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove apa dekat sungei buloh tu kan so I guess they decided to jalan keluar jauh sikit lor
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do uh they will do um macam awareness macam don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't apa apa you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context lah these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know oh they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group uh this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies meh ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is kau tahu macam
macam macam the ornithologist yang tengok-tengok observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know the otters in the city wow can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like wow what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like macam unlikely sight
ya mana ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently uh couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at entah bukit merah or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
ya all these com cats kat bawah it's the natural predator apa natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already mati because of these the snake pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang snake tu yang snake tu tengah com cat dekat depan dekat mak news ah snake com cat ah
okay so err tadi kan kita cakap pasal three wish tadi kita cakap pasal the three wishes kan for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
your youtube punya channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
because macam I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights lah but if you don't have those kind macam those text yang dekat tepi tu say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video dia orang tak on the audio what kau kalau macam the person switch off the audio and you just you playing macam tak ada some err text visuals to compliment you punya video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft jer
oh okay I faham so that means dia punya the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel kan it's like macam highlights for that particular night punya game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses lah that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve lah
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of macam those err it gives me that kind of impression macam when I watch people play game kan it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video macam it's just it's similar just like the makan punya channel or makan punya video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious mm ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience boleh visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of err are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the um your spidey spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is apa tu the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's haram because it's very very very ketat unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my aurat so I I mean macam if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement ah tapi yang the one you beli tu berapa ah
black cat apa cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather kan cat woman punya
cat woman punya okay ah ada cat woman punya I nak ah
oh ya you dah telefon your mother to come tomorrow
no wah you tahu my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days eh oh my god I was like
how did everyone accumulate two digit punya leave balance seh
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time kalau tak already I tell you by august begitu kan I would already have exhausted all my leave already for safwan appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember saffi hospitalise
ya I guess that's the only one ah oh ya tadi kita cakap pasal what can you mentioned the IKEA punya cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
whether right we should just err err fix the cabinet dekat err the master bedroom side because um for this mean toilet I nak ada other some improvements in err in terms like macam there's that rail handrail so that down the road kan kita tak payah nak renovate
ya because adding the macam cabinet there kan it might like macam block orang punya as in it might block lah whoever who
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the jamban
then oh right that was not your right the one that err rumah dia is actually just opposite B P there right the resale kan actually no wonder they need to err hack the toilet because she um megan got tell me before the dia punya rumah tu macam quite rundown and then if they don't fix it kan macam is cannot as in there will be leak and everything lah
huh ya ke that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
oh then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything ya ke izzad punya rumah dekat mana
oh they take over they are not err apa tu getting a new house ah because I know the dia orang punya cousin wardah and umar kan nearby kan that's why they don't intend to shift ah
so bila ija bersalin
oh man tapi they they always give a one week one week
tak baik seh cakap macam tu
I think I think dia pun worried seh
eh tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan
orh what tanya jer ah what the heck
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time ah the pregnancy ah I really want to have that element of surprise lah it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will tak boleh tak boleh like not prepare
it cannot that and then I know for me kan I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't macam if I'm not wrong planning need or what right macam it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it what cause like my kid keluar I need to macam make sure oh dia punya the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours lah it's just that I don't know ah macam
macam ah very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green kan actually the bottle yang I belikan tu all green kan because ah safwan punya milk pun green dia punya apparel pun green ingat tak and then dia punya yang all the friends yang kita beli ni semua
colour hitam so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination macam those kind of paddle pop punya colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
yang dia rainbow tau yang paddle pop punya ice cream tu tau
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue kan kan it goes well with this kind of pink kan cantik kan
wah okay lah actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually kan I nak amend and fix the dapur punya counter top I really cannot stand the counter top lah ya macam so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the macam the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because macam kita punya rumah is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind tak masuk I did but the thing is when I wipe it kan there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya lah usually they will they have like some uh ventilation lah so that the tu so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing lah I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the apa tu pintu cabinet will pecah kan actually oh my god
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was err my friend called ah from uh ya just like uh like so it was quite interesting because uh they needed a picture of a day doctor err then err the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital tapi they need a doctor to be featured dia orang punya newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer lah so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel ni I took I took a picture and err portrait punya macam mode kan
but when I when I send across kan it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it macam why would you need like um a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like dia require exactly three hundred because kita punya my mobile phone kan when I check uh is like hundred eighty
so no choice nak kena pakai lah
ya lah but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two apa tu two style eh two apa tu file format one is the raw one is the uh so kalau macam dia orang nak edit kan they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the macam the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in dua punya format then I send to the to the printer err not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw kan actually raw image it has to be set from a camera kan
are you planning to change your phone oh wait you change already ah I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I suka dengan my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I tak nak pixel but that time kan tak ada ingat tak I ordered online
it's it's really huge ah serious I just find it too huge but macam when I hold it on my palm kan I will need to stretch I punya thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I ambil I ambil the ring and tampal you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card punya holder tu so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder
the kids see that one they don't like tak sedap seh I don't like it's just damn weird oh but I like the ninja chicken burger though
love it I don't know the sauce is called nambam sauce or something like that namban tak pernah dengar seh that sauce
is never never heard before I pernah dengar macam miso err miso err teriyaki is like some people ask me whether is teriyaki I feel like is a mix of teriyaki and something salty I don't know what its chicken is nice you tak you tak try ke that time
kenapa kepala you pening tak minum air eh
you should just do eh tadi mana air I eh
oh ya anyway tadi weather was ya okay tadi the seller stop dekat mana
habis macam mana but is ready is ready ah
I'm just thinking like whether this person dia ada jangkit or what sebab tu dia tak kasi you picit the door bell no but don't even allow you to knock usually I don't mind knocking initially I don't mind knocking but door bell cannot doorbell is too loud
on the floor tak ada bench orh okay lor
that's very considerate of you all the deliveries yang I dapat all hang at the handle ah then I was like how am I suppose to open the gate without dropping it so I I pick up with my hand and then I open the gate nonsense kan that's very considerate and very thoughtful
so dua the dua is dari mana punya section
no but dia nak kena tulis apa like you accumulate like which is like blind spot okay right
tapi yang paling kelakar yang I tak faham is I punya kereta I pass sekali I punya motor I fail it one time
take so long to cakap I punya figure of eight eh take so long to finish lah figure of eight must be eight seconds
ya lambat must be more than six seconds
did I tell you some uh an accident that I witness on the on a plank orang ni dia err it was rainy um but ah it was sad lah because after dia I witness dia punya accident I think it was it will stay in my mind that I couldn't forget and then I fell on the speed you know the the you have to speed up your speed then you have to brake at the line ya correct so what happened at the plank was I was right behind this person
I tak tahu apa or kaki dia stuck or what kan dia went up the plank dia dah nak dah nak like maybe err err five metres or like maybe one or two metres away from the last one and then jatuh off and then dia punya gigi hit the another side habis chip off the two teeth chip and it was not a nice cut oh it was like a like a diagonal line
oh my god you I tengokkan dia and it was a guy yo I mean okay ah I'm I'm not saying that oh err guys should be okay girl shouldn't lah but seriously it was not even a test it was raining a practice session oh my god habis dia gini-gini dia asyik pegang dia punya gigi tau instructor ada instructor no but
but rabak he just trip like that you know even the whole gigi patah tau the dua gigi patah better kan
oh boleh eh as long as you find your because I I know he didn't pick up the thing ah
oh I see I though you tampal from the
sial oh I can't forget seh I tu dia terus kan I bailed I cakap is okay I think the plank very slippery I go the other one dia betul-betul I try the apa tu emergency break tu I think I step on the the the err back punya brake kan too hard dia punya is so weird tau the back tire just swing forward you know it's so fast you know it's just like swing macam ini seh then I drop on my left knee

because you say nanti you penat lah you nak I bawa motor lah apa lah
it's just water what is not like rosak what
kejap kejap vendor for what the backdrop
oh habis sekarang
the vendor bail pasal you all make too much changes or the vendor bail pasal you all tak bayar betul-betul
uh huh habis
but not because you guys made banyak changes ah
apa nama company dia
you mean but the company is not father in law dia punya company ah
I see tapi you cakap lah maybe your kerja kasi you freelance
eh vendor tak nak buat dekat you all
the yang this video ni siapa yang minta dia
so the person that I don't really like tu yang siapa tu so this saturday this sunday she will officially become that number one lah
because I know whereby sitting as a board member you can err you will officially can become macam you voluntarily kan volunteer with err providing your remarks and everything kan so called strategic directions when you are just talking and complicating things right
that's like senang kata ah senang kata because too many cooks spoil the broth
the broth tak lah spoil the soup lah wait what's the what's the idiom again apa too many cooks spoil the apa apa soup what serious I suka ah berbual macam
pasal kita no
tak pasal kita pun sejak kita kahwin kan we only kita selalu keluar and berbual macam ini only when kita the before with kids are really easy our window is just like tanya okay dah alright any long conversation do it with a phone kan we are a phone phone ah what conversation ya
kalau lah boleh screenshot jer the text messages and then err verbalise it screenshot the old messages and then we just verbalise the the text messages that would be fun
aiyo I'm just thinking uh okay I'm just thinking yang sunday ni this sunday ni eh kejap you sunday eh this saturday you kerja kan sunday ada apa wait there's something on happening on saturday orh eddie kahwin habis why why your reaction like that
no but how do I tell my father that he can't come wait kita punya wedding is for what time to what time ah two hours jer kat pasir ris lah kan okay two thirty to four can nanti kita kita naik teksi sana unless you want to go the downtown east ah lepas tu
nak pergi downtown east tak lepas tu I don't know ya but I think nak kena book ah you know nak kena book you know eh no no no tapi I rasa dia orang nak pergi wild wild wet tau boleh kita pergi wild wild wet lepas tu
alah confirm the kids nak main the tayoh
wah that means this weekend we are completely filled alah eh this month siapa punya birthday lagi you cakap
no I mean family lah family siapa eh punya birthday
asal you tak ambil gambar bila you dah dapat kan senang
mm mana ada dah berhenti apa it's not lah ya lah ya lah
sorry ah I pakai contact lens please
kena lah it's just um the thing is that I have too many that I don't know which one to do first ya lah but usually
oh aduh the the the person yang email I ni dah apa tu ya yang tadi I berbual dengan dia tu dia dah email eh oh dia also macam I sama ah a'ah
tak lah what we are small fry we are obviously right that's why a'ah seh kita semua dari tu eh get that experience
dah lah that's the thing is lah a meritocracy world I don't know lah I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is dekat my place ni kan I don't know why is like your capabilities tak cukup tau you punya papers is to macam is to support dia punya capabilities padahal it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that lah of course lah]basic is like have you pernah masak ke tak lah kan tapi doesn't mean tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you suruh I buat something
but to compensate me to compensate me you cakap oh err I know you do a good job tapi but sorry you not wearing uh err this err nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not kita tak boleh buat apa-apa this kind of things are like beyond our hands oh the
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense kan then bila I cakap macam tu will be like shit don't be too don't be too like err ini lah
see ah can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you tahu I kena buat about this digital plan about this um publicity booking schedule tau this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six eh I kasi one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I punya like okay for example maybe person A ada event then person B dia bukan event dia punya it's just a reminder ke some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to uh ah I have to give priority to the A person kan but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
err you have three people who want to put reminders and you tak ada event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing ah is it the thing is I can do it but it requires err half a day I cannot do this kind of planning kan macam like as a macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana I cannot I need to do macam I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so sekarang ni so I don't even want to start on it
that admin person coming second jan a'ah wah because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is itulah dia I don't know eh maybe err Q one end of Q one building up ya you dengar you dengar ni
actually I like something it's very funny tau this person yang masuk ni dia contact so many people around me except me tau to ask me about the job to ask about the job tau macam like
you could you just ask me what padahal kita but then I always like no orang yang dia tanya semua melayu like is like kau boleh tanya aku apa like ya shah aku dengar ada opening I mean macam we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the apa tu the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me apa seh dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah left a'ah macam dah transfer this one I tak tahu whether macam a'ah dia tanya sinar habis tu dia tanya meha except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and orang yang tak kerja dekat department tu I don't get it seh
then I just like macam so I am a bit err I'm a bit like macam weary tau kalau macam why why she needs to tanya orang lain besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I tak payah nak guide through macam that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running eh maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector kan dia ada we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very macam very very rank conscious apparently you you macam like err of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that macam sometimes bukan
orang rank conscious tau is because like you tak boleh ask err a associate to be doing err punya kerja ya it's not a right what ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank tau it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I tak faham when people say like oh err you shouldn't be err you um saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin ah you can see as like oh ya uh I shouldn't be err drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing lor I I find that it's very hard to juggle kat at this this place I'm working at
dia macam tak dia tak err macam kalau kat yang kerja lama I ni dia very is very obvious tau macam you macam tadi my yang call I dia cakap dengan I err kat at least dekat kerja lama kita kan err we know okay this for this job cuma but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them tau macam if thing goes wrong kan they are supposed to check
this and um they should be responsible um take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person kan ah baru punya orang and this person is from punya side lah so they are still learning the ropes to run that place ah side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for err diploma holders so dulu kan exactly so kan I bilang you there's ah err in that admission kan they have um
err the comms officer err assistant comms officer dengan abassir kan the one that I kan melayu they are very so now comms officer boleh pergi can take up the comms officer job
I know lah tapi macam ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go tapi dia tak pakai tu ah ni ah tak pakai tudung ya so I mean it still applies lah I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this err diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like ah that's why you say macam the cockroach keluar malam-malam kan I mean dia orang mati kan I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like dah lama sia I spray but if you notice this past few nights I tak spray tau maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but err what I heard is you run over the tray kan you got you mati
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line kan they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda punya powder tau then semua mati
bedak just normal bedak ah not bedak apa-apa
oh macam the the talcum powder eh
eh dah lama tak dengar khabar
um in the group chat lah bodoh
oh my god dia pun beli bija
who are what went downhill kau I mean like dia tak berbual banyak ke pe
and how did you macam mana kau end the thing
kau tengah nangis pe
but also dia pun kawan dia baru itu then like

feelings balik
they'll I don't know what what power lah okay but macam dia orang they have like this mindset right that they okay anything I say or anything I do confirm girls confirm girls will fall for it
aku dah cakap lah dia dia kalau comfortable dengan orang tu dia dia selalu buat gitu
adik kau pilih si izuan ke ah dia cakap eh kau ni bapak kau tak lawa tak handsome ke macam
I don't know why many people many girls find izuan handsome termasuk kau but
I don't know it's just me even elfie cakap tau ya ya oi that time aku tanya dia eh

then dia kata a'ah not bad why abeh dia cakap dia orang handsome ke because most girls find find them handsome
kau jangan wei sembilan belas ada yang dah tunang sia
dua puluh satu dah nak kahwin seh
I mean some other way kau boleh macam
if the feelings hilang already what
his one right I think his type of like macam
convincing or talk or apa apa ah in general
his type is to like macam lead you on
okay macam okay
humairah said that he still like macam cakap to you cakap
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he tak itu
so jangan don't don't think that that is the end of the world also
mm cheat juga so it's two ways
tak nak tanya lah
toxic bodoh
oh mana aku tahu aku ingatkan perempuan tu
you can't K the thing is kau tak boleh expect like a guy to look so great
cause that's when you know macam kau kau confirm tak boleh dapat
you know it's not their hati yang gatal it's bawah dia orang gatal
terus dia reject
kau reject eh
oh ya kau tolak eh kau cakap I I'm still moving on
I think he said because kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua kan zack is the opposite what that's why he feels like very competitive gitu dia tak suka
alah kesiannya you but did you tell him that
kau cakap apa dalam letter tu
comelnya okay
you should just tell him that kau orang together not because your expectation of a guy is
macam you should say that at least he tried it's easier
oh dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat
okay I mean dia tak teruk seteruk aku tau but
kawan pun boleh eventually turn out to be so
that's that is the beauty of like having friends lah itu jer
selenge aku ketuk kau kan kepala ke kau kau cakap pasal si zack depan-depan dia sia
aku I was like laughing behind the screen I was like I want to look at izuan's reaction
ya tapi dalam hati tu mesti sakit padan muka
ya lah okay you're you're moving on two months dia dah break up dengan kau two months
it's kenal-kenal

then sekali err two of us were walking in front
sekali yang kat belakang tu tertinggal then got other people then them ah lepas tu aku dengan humairah tengah cakap cakap ah I I wasn't talking I was on my handphone
then aku cakap err not really just cakap cakap jer
because I got the dating app also then after that err dia cakap I asked her back lah you have boyfriend before
dia kata if I'm not wrong dia cakap err
that guy the guy yang kerja dengan dia kat tu
yes she told me she told me about his macam apa cakap oh dia dulu budak madrasah and stuff like that

ya and then after that I was like I was so shocked lah like mak dia tak suka
like the girl dia punya ex gaduh dengan gaduh ya I'm like
ya exactly it's not her what humairah madrasah ke takkan alim jer
you know that a guy from madrasah
suka dengan budak madrasah yang lagi satu then I'm like
but but look like at the kids yang dah pernah madrasah even if I don't know they have done it
K but very annoyed itu cerita lain ke
I literally gave up you know when he said that aku macam tak nak gaduh lah diam jer lah
he said what layer layer layer aku cakap am I not layering that one
feel uncomfortable ah like macam
okay it's not it's not bad that he tegur but tegur tu like
cakap baik-baik not not say
it's not his tone it's the way he say it he macam cakap can you not wear like that macam gitu
nanti lelaki will think otherwise that one that that one I don't mind
if he says like that I don't mind but he says as if I'm the I'm the macam I'm the one wrong
tu pasal aku dah macam marah that's why I was pissed
aku dah cakap apa terang-terang like kau nak pakai itu kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu then it's not my problem
aku pun pissed gila wei gitu dengar
I don't know we were talking about oh no kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik
lepas tu aku tanya dia like husni was like talking because kita tiga jer kan dah biasa
then after that we just talk ah macam
err we need to talk about like macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia emo gitu
lepas tu aku bilang lah dia orang macam apa jadi
like as in apa jadi as in like uh why is she still feeling sad lah gitu
then aku just cakap in my opinion I think
dia masih belum move on gitu ya then after that ya
mm and then lepas tu
husni cakap maybe
err husni came to a conclusion he just said that um
because like uh that is why you shouldn't play dating app ni semua
ya then after that aku macam it's like aku cakap ah macam sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person itu jer
for fun also what kau nak kenal-kenal orang jer pe
tell me that uh takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga tau lelaki ni semua tak bagus
then after that aku cakap lah aku cakap dengan dia like uh the guy I talking to that irfan
I told him that about that guy ah macam mana dia cakap dengan aku gitu
husni cakap ya just um next time just be careful jer lah
then kata aku cakap um
aku bilang husni ah aku tanya dia in my in your opinion lah do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
pasal tu husni cakap no you cannot see anything what
it's just one line dah tu jer
wah it'll it will trigger me right if he say that dulu kau pakai tutup aurat lepas tu kau pakai gini
tak he never say that before but if he says it that I'm gonna flip out sia
and the thing yang aku pakai tadi kan baju tu kan yang colour purple you cannot see anything what
ya it's just the ke belakang what
pasal dia tak berani nak cakap apa-apa that's why
kirakan apa birthday surprise dia bodoh
buka buka gitu birthday surprise
lupakan jer aku tak kisah
aku pakai gitu pun like I fikir about my family
relatives semua dah tahu aku dulu pakai tudung semua
mm itu sebab apa because that one time I suddenly change ah I just suddenly like that tak pakai tudung
nenek aku makcik aku ah like because kita dah rapat gila that's why I don't mind what they say ah
then she she very abeh dia baru lagi
I I I just jawab ah tak ah dekat jer nak buat apa
lepas tu dia kata huh gitu eh
ah gitu lah buat apa
so just kalau kau tak pakai takpe lah
this is the first time I post about yang I tak pakai tudung just ambil gambar biasa jer kan
not tegur as in bad tegur ah dia orang macam cakap eh lawanya
I'm not trying to brag ah but they said eh lawanya kau pakai gini
then I was like oh okay thank you gitu
just so I don't try to bring it up lah gitu

pasal dah ya lah
tak lah
aku pergi mongolia royalty tu
even the girls that I know that pakai tudung kan right
they they buka somewhat they same time as me I mean after me

then the lepas tu holiday pasal aku ada internship kan aku tak pakai
then from then aku tak pakai
sebab tu aku macam like a bit hesitant to wear lah
it's very stupid if they ban that lah macam bodoh sangat lah
that's that's the bad thing you know because it's your adik right then you are the kakak you're supposed to show example then they they have the mindset that
ya you're supposed to learn from your kakak that's all
I mean doesn't suit as in macam kau tak ready gitu
lepas kahwin then okay lah maybe
like because we ignored it right macam kau try to avoid it that's why dia dah malas nak cakap

don't tell the customer just say that we are clearing our leave tak tahu apasal boss suruh macam be confidential about it padahal it's quite known in singapore banyak orang sebab tu in the end um but I have to say what she say lah she's on leave dia tengah cuti so um during the meeting everybody um listen semua dengar semua ye so the two err explain that the two unpaid leave tu nak kena ambil december
february dengan march
then kalau macam the situation doesn't improve
err start for this err unpaid leave cuti kena ambil
compulsory you cannot macam bawa to the next err month you have to err settle lah within that month but rotate err every member kena ada backup dalam office
so that at least ada one person to answer customers' calls
kena ah so macam today is one of the unpaid ah
unpaid cuti err for december hari ni aku ambil dengan another day next week
so dalam bulan december aku kerja seven days only
best kalau boleh pergi holiday
and tak tolak gaji
ah free kan dapat
ya I think civil servants ada restriction kan
but two years eh kawan aku kata they don't know indefinitely
then macam mana um then how they clear the leave
I think they can break I think they will pay that time got ada keluar news apa
aku tak ingat apa ah tapi ada ada incentive the government say because they know that the civil servants cannot clear leaves
so cuti they will back they will back pay will cash or something
ada kan
for civil servants confirm ada that day baru ada pe they will they will pay the err they will bayar
tapi tak ada yang you know the apa usually apa bonus tu yang
extra berapa bulan for government civil servants ah that one tak should be tak ada adik aku pun tengah
she also mengeluh because
biasa ah kita dah beli beli beli barang we always macam nak kena
they hope they hope dia macam she hope for the bonus to
dia boleh bayar balik ah bill bill
kau tak perasan ke yang bila kau dah stop kerja then work from home ni that your your that your apa tu expenditure is lesser
tak lesser ke
motor masih keep ah
kereta memang necessary for korang pasal korang a family of enam
family of enam enam six cats seven cats
tapi alhamdulillah lah aku rasa ada berkat lah macam I'm sure somehow eh dia dia cukup tau cuma kita macam rasa macam we maybe because we don't see the the income coming in every month as a lump sum eh so we think macam
we are restricted tapi actually barang-barang semua masih still go on
dia penatnya apa bila kau kat rumah then dengan kerja while working nak kena tengok budak tengok rumah kemas lagi sebab tu macam overwhelming
time masa off
mm betul
jemput makan eh jemput minum sila kan
dah dah settle
bila dapat tu results
then dia nya first choice ah
yang yang okay what secondary school will that be
masa masa zaman-zaman kita tu the reputation not very good ah
oh but eh now maybe dah changed ke
oh the neighbourhood situ eh
tahniah for your result
ah jual besi
every month every month macam one point three for one account tau
so yang bulan lepas err our sales
cuma two hundred fifty eight K
tak drop banyak tu from one million err dia dia start turun bila tau bulan june july august
dah start to decline then the number of orders we used to get like hundred over orders dalam satu hari
sekarang satu hari dua tiga ke empat order macam system and it's like cutting metals for like a few inches orh really really very bad the demand drop
err dorang buat dorang assemble untuk ah the machine assemble untuk ah oil rig masuk kan dalam oil rig
so you know yang macam equinox err shell axon order kat all the oil rigs tu when they put things inside the down hole stuff too ah that metal they they buy from us kita kirakan macam distributor ah sell the metal kerja memang sebenarnya kerja aku ni jual besi
ada macam-macam size the round bars the tube all the tubings nanti they will order macam certain sizes then we need to look at the drawing sometimes they say ah we want to make something from this so what do you have dalam stock
to offer um benda-benda gini ah nanti dalam inventory tengok ah size yang kena ada abeh aku kena plan inventory for them the stock level must be always available so that bila dorang beli bendanya ada tak payah tunggu
cuma different product ah barang lain so
somehow yang bila yang last year tu bila aku dapat promoted tu from one account they ask me to also take over another account
so kirakan macam two accounts combined ni is the two biggest account dalam company mm
which is unexpected lah yang pasal aku kan baru habis cerai that time kan
then ah after the divorce tu
somehow ah aku tak tahu ah then the boss yang cina tu kata um we need to look into your portfolio you need to grow yourself so
then err dia tanya aku nak ke tidak macam if bukan aku dia akan offer to another person then the other person if not ambitious ah this girl dalam company aku ni there's another account manager yang very ambitious
then dia pursue dia punya degree at the same time I with her own money pasal dia nak aku rasa dia nak position boss aku boss aku asia and ah
asia-pac marketing and apa eh marketing and apa director
so dia kata if you don't take tak take up this position I'll have to offer to another person the your colleague
then the other person ni dia okay dia ambitious aku tahu it suits it suits her lah tu macam dia bukan ada
not someone yang there yet lah but pada aku macam not the
ah tak
bukan experience dia macam dia micro manage ah
abeh dia imposed macam kerja-kerja macam dia punya
dia bahasa kalau dia buat format eh
kalau aku buat format nak kena macam gini nak kena ikut tau team members semua kena ikut cara dia gitu ah dia akan check one by one kau buat kerja betul ke tidak like if you don't do it um betul-betul dia macam
dia send one email nanti dia kasi
dia buat ah step one step two step three really really micro manage punya kind of person jadi macam
aku pula bahasa agaknya aku tak teratur tak organise langsung
aku akan usually dengan budak dengan team members aku bilang dorang you do like this tapi pandai-pandai kau lah buat cara sendiri lah takde format punya benda tau dia lain dia bahasa kena ada format dia nak kena after this dot must have exclamation mark atau question mark that kind tau
very teratur very neat and tertib tulisan dia pun very tu kadang-kadang aku pun hairan macam mana dia boleh
aku totally opposite tapi boss aku cakap macam dia cakap err she will also be promoted but she will take care of the well head activities then aku take over the down hole activities so that time aku fikir err try jer lah ambil jer dulu lah that's how sekali dah take over dengan tahun ni dengan COVID ah kau sales baik dua account twenty one million ah tahun ni tak aku rasa
work wise ah work wise macam aku boleh manage ah cuma every night sekarang almost every night nak kena kerja
kena buat report
kat during the day tak there's simply not enough time mana answer customer nya email then err nanti ada quality issues lah supply chain issues logistic tak datang lah then at the same time kau kena check into inventory then check into macam housekeeping at the same time kita kena think of ways to reduce the inventory
macam-macam lah dalam satu hari one day you can like
tak boleh habis so nanti benda-benda report yang bahasa nak kena churn out data
aku buat malam kat rumah atau that time during work from home tu kan tu lagi productivity terus turun pasal siang anuh budak-budak take care of the kids punya tu
nanti aku macam takde aku tak boleh focus tau ah macam aku punya walaupun tak banyak kerja rumah aku boleh just let go tak buat apa-apa
tapi you can't macam tak boleh tau the data that you're you're doing at that point I rasa macam
takpe ah nanti I need macam quietness at the night baru aku buat ah tapi pada time malam aku dah tidurkan elly nanti aku dah energy aku dah gone that's why sometimes aku cakap telefon apa jamu nak ambil
yang deep station yang tu aku beli kan
itu aku rasa help with tangan aku that time
pasal bila lepas two months aku rasa macam takde effect aku stop tapi right after aku stop tu
about one month tu tangan aku clear tau dah tak gatal-gatal lagi tau there's a period aku remember aku jumpa liyana um she also noticed eh tangan dah baik your hand is better now
sekali one month aku tidur rumah aku start balik
so aku rasa sebab aku stop the deep station thing ke every night every morning aku consume waktu bulan puasa dengan hari raya
pasal so mana lah aku tahu buat tu ada saffron mana seh nak dapat

panel of windows saja biasa kalau buka tingkap
habuk masuk macam luar takde apa-apa tau is like the it's like a enclosed area
in between sebelah ada lagi satu neighbour jiran sebelah kirakan they won't be able to see the
the the scenery ah kirakan window dalam rumah tu semua buka takde view langsung
it's either to a close enclosed space atau um
tu rumah about aku rasa dia build in two year two O O two

dia macam shock ah macam tak tahu kan what what to how to what to do pasal dia everyday will will chat on the phone with the girl they don't they don't meet often
kalau meet ada kawan kau ada kawan-kawan together
um then the girl I think the err family dia very warak so seldom keluar

what for have relationship kalau macam jarang keluar she's very restricted by the family
dia sendiri kata macam I think dia macam can't be bother anymore just call it off lah

then ah nanti time sahur jer nanti dia cakap you will hear she will hear a lot of things macam budak nangis lah perempuan nangis lah kan then I was like thinking
bulan puasa seh
mm so moral of the story is don't marry a turkish man gitu eh
tak ah tak sangat ah
ah serious yang mana
ada ke seh anak buat mak gila
itu dabbe lah
ya it's not the mak buat
no mak dia kahwin kira dia dua ni mak dia dua ni dia orang bukan adik-beradik tau dia orang adik tiri
ya that but they don't know that dia orang adik tiri
ah it's not that the girl yang buat it's not the kakak yang buat tau
is it not the mak yang buat dulu ke
no mak dia yang buat dulu then terus dia punya hantu dengan jin tu pergi dekat kakak dia
yang dia nya yang dia nya best friend ada affair dengan dia punya husband kan
husband dia bunuh perempuan tu because of one gambar a'ah
but husband dia padan muka lah ya
siapa suruh cheat cheat on the best friend pula tu
she seek another doctor nya help tu kan dengan tukang ubat
but then kan kau ingat yang dia pergi yang dia punya yang dia pergi dekat tempat tukang ubat tu ke yang tempat doktor tu then ada satu budak perempuan tu yang boleh nampak-nampak barang kan dia cakap yang mulut dia kena paku kena begitu like what she did to herself
ya lah because they think macam why would a
jahat person come to seek for help
ya lah ya lah
ya lah but it's already written in the quran yang kau yang there's another world ya
eh tadi aku nak tanya apa eh
oh nanti dapat dia punya hundred dollars nya tu then they cannot stack the
pasal it's not like hundred dollars dia orang just hundred dollars again tau like it's break it's break it's broken into like maybe twenty dollars aku rasa
they say macam ada satu tempat tu yang dia punya fish and chips ke burger dia sedap
bedek eh
mak dia penakut ah
I don't know I've never ride the mummy before masa tu aku rasa
was either long queue atau tengah
then that time aku naik yang jurassic park kan basah kan after that kau tahu aku pergi mana yang tea cup nya
because I dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi there was this one yang dekat tempat tak ingat lah dekat tempat mana but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree habis aku kan
habis aku kan
buat christmas tree kan dulu
so aku pergi dekat aku macam aku nak pegang-pegang sekali tiba-tiba benda tu move tu aku terkejut
tak sis mak kau
because it managed to macam scare aku ah tu aku macam
ya he was laughing pasal macam aku kan susah nak takutkan a'ah then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu
sixty something sama lah aku rasa
but one of the scariest is aku punya kawan ya tak pun yang the kak pon clan and she also looked like kak pon ah that one
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like kak pon
a'ah she is one of the ni lah kira kak pon punya scarers lah but she never entah lah dia tak cakap apa-apa pun
kan I wanted to go seh because aku rasa
yang hari tu aku pergi pun the the year before aku pergi the only thing that scared me was the
sabah dia orang macam buat sabah punya voodoo shit begitu
ya lah
dia no dia macam ah aborigine punya ni ah orang that apa tu
what is that called orang asli orang asli
it's not really macam scary
aku suka eh benda begini
sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu kan and then they were like saying yang sis huzairi ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua then suddenly dia punya kawan just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time macam
lain hari ah then ah then they were like macam apa seh engkau tiba-tiba ah then sekali I think he texted or cakap ah the next time err or like call or something aku pun tak ingat
mmhmm dia dekat situ then dia cakap ah eh dia balik ah then after that ah baru dia cakap ah tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang kan
habis ah then they say lah macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
there's no such thing as ghosts what there's only jin
I don't know ah because like macam hari tu aku tengok yang incredible tales tu kan they say their ah kong is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then a'ah for the departed then they just macam dia orang tak burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah so he went back to the house
okay but I got this one question for you habis kalau if you are poor what even can you do
it's not the worst sin lah but they believe that macam
ya lah but kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun it's not it's not a
you want to bunuh people with what seh I don't know you have don't have anything what
ya but at the point of time it's not kira dia macam you are not of sound mind tau at the point of time
ya but then that's the only kira macam that's the only sin lah kan
betul lah that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
tak juga no I mean like islam is fair because macam dia orang akan
akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau and then after that if you have your buruk and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your buruk but then after that you will be given a chance to
taubat lah that's why got
I asked this question during umrah
ya lah then that's why I say that's why that time I was in umrah then they they was talking about this lah like ah before we went to umrah we have like the course kan habis dia orang tanya lah macam okay then bila kita zaman ah this ustaz macam rock rock sikit lah habis dia cakap then bila kita zaman time zaman rock kita pun terlepas solat then dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat lah solat taubat then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back macam qada because you know you don't know how many
how would I know siapa kita nak judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga just because dia kasi air dekat anjing tu so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to pertikaikan kita punya amalan
kalau aku pun aku bunuh sia aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa
but he already bunuh the ustaz
ya lah that's why kan aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting sis kan aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki ah tapi dah maki lah tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda word this word is for another word but actually kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu
mm maki jer
that's why macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah plus point dah malaikat dah tulis dah oh dia nak solat ah dia terus nak pergi tak oh tak dia tak pergi tapi tak minus tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya ya then if kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak oh nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai lah orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu and dia buat jahat then baru dia orang tulis
it makes it macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam because
like orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya sister sister nak sembahyang pun sister nak solat kita buat jer yang wajib
doesn't mean like you don't wear your tudung your amalan is lesser than
yang spaghetti bolognese punya hook tu aku cakap apa tu yang
lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that aku ni ah aku ni perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people lah
oh sis lagi kena teruk everytime I wear tudung then people all like macam cakap aku ni macam-macam
it's not about step good good ah dia macam macam ah alah perempuan tudung ni semua you know the guys that I like get to know right they say macam perempuan tudung ni
actually senang jer
macam kira senang dapat ah
it doesn't matter lah I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just apa kita
like I think those kind of things so so macam
mengghairahkan and
siapa nurul
the cantik one
she what her display picture ah yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab
no I mean like macam you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
tak ah sis more aware ah
but how to makan ah with niqab so you just open like that then makan I mean like ya ya lah
ya but then macam that's how people see you as a hijabi ah so when kau macam jatuhkan judgement dekat niqabi when orang jatuhkan judgement as
dekat kau as a hijabi then kau macam tak boleh terima
but actually macam betul lah cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
ilmu lah kenapa kau nak pakai niqab so engkau punya journey
so macam kau punya journey tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu
dia macam there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
tapi macam okay speaking of this eh I was like thinking tau masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam very ah small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and dia orang punya tulang is very small so like
not say macam fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then macam bila aku pakai eh aku rasa macam then I was saying this to nek yam you know then I was like macam eh habis nanti orang pakai habis macam
you know all these people macam pakai macam terletak jer then macam for me is like terletak and then tiba-tiba macam shoulder besar
and shoulder besar and then like then macam tergantung ah macam tergantung kita macam hanger so it's like it's not nice ah pada aku then after that nek yam said something that macam terus macam aku terus ugh
macam then she say you wear things you want to wear a niqab you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of allah
sis terus shut up lah
ya lah but doesn't mean kau presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just macam kau tak boleh change diri engkau
dapat sis looking at her
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time macam she became a basic
but then macam but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly ringarde lah
in dunia lah mmhmm
tapi macam kalau kau dah actually kau pakai hijab jer kau dah kena sacrifice all these things seh slowly lah

nanti aku ajak I think I will ask my nephew my cousins these two
we're not into gold yet no no no we're not the makcik makcik who likes wearing gold
I think today there's really not much to talk about lah because macam
there was a lecture online today tu jer ah
talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
but dia datang lambat
really really kau asyik datang sekolah lambat seh
no but the previous semester usually kau on time for school
speaking of attendance kau tahu aku that time dapat email dari sekolah cakap
just masalah ni like macam
okay K this is err out of topic but like you know leh ni tak tahu siapa asyik reply aku punya tak eh reply aku punya pula always like replying to my instagram stories
yes yes you know this person and dia ah sama course dengan kita masa I think sekarang pun sama lah
mm boleh can
ya Q asyik reply to my eh why do I keep saying reply to my apa tu lah reply to my ah instagram story
but it when he reply right it's always the randomness things macam for example if
and then he will wah tempat ni kat mana seh
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
ini playground aku
apasal dengan budak ni ah maybe
ya and then but tapi recently kan
so dia macam tanya eh this week intern apa eh this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
oh and then err I will reply ah this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern
then I will reply the same thing we twenty one but then I don't want to tanya lah you don't have any classmate meh macam offensive seh
tak tak tak uh this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after
but but dia but he got message you on instagram what that time kau tunjuk aku
no lah I'm I'm not overthinking about it and I I don't like to fikir banyak sangat about this pasal anyways if
if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive kan
dia tahu pe aku ada mata air so why would he even try
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly I am the most boring person in the world and I aku tak suka social interaction
kalau if
stop it and then and then ah he asked me that this is like tengah malam so like twelve midnight
but then I was so lazy so malas to like look up the thing cause I was already in bed macam nak tidur
I told him that and then he is like oh okay tak apa dah jumpa
and I okay you just wasted my time and then he started to move on pasal
uh apa tu about what's my and everything then and
he actually pandai seh his is three point two you know
and then ah I see wah your cumulative is so good then he ask me your intern kau dapat A ah then I say
ya I get A what about you and then dia cakap dia dapat B can't believe he dapat B actually kan that time I berbual with captain ho dia cakap most of the boys dapat B meanwhile the girls get A
aiya whatever lah it's over already anyways your tinggi pe so like there's nothing to
risaukan ya
then he said alah university kalau university pun uh he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it ee
K K kau suka dia
tapi but we are the same height what
ah ya ya can you please tell me what happened I want to know nak tahu
notice apa why ah why leh
huh siapa yang reject kau sia I mean you're like damn pretty
aku feel so betrayed
jauh pe orchard is so far
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau dah nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
I think I think you kau ada cakap telegram oh
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
actually ah I have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together lah so sejak kecil until besar
tapi kan the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
eh no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like secucuk for you lah
adik-adik ya stop it sia
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu ah yang I can recommend to you
no I I told you what he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like I kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so mm
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
ya I faham I faham
but that kind of person susah nak cari seh because like nowadays guys are just
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
actually uh after the truth or dare game right I thought dia
tak suka aku because like I feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
then I am like wasn't the tak oh is he not at me
ya lah tu
huh I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia seh ya
yes yes there was the story then ah you know then after that I teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch lah and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh I think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then ah kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then eh his ex nampak lah then
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up lah
ah aku just tak suka when like uh apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan I mean just make it clear lah that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air sia
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because I don't even know who he is so
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
like kau orang are just platonic friends lah
the mata air dia just have issues lah I think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan yasmin
I don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look ah the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah lah
speaking of the office you know my sister ah I told my kakak about uh all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then uh dia akan uh bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should err the office two point O
aku is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
ah after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person lah and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku seh this one you pass back to err si logistics dulu then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau pe
mm it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
um I I get what you mean though because macam oh at
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID kita kena work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and then oh and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
mm I mean ah almost hari-hari kan my boss will tanya everyone oh what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
um kim yam road nak pergi sengkang okay lah and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit oh my goodness
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so huh
wah so jangan lah
is it jannah dari mata air
kau tak eh
who who who do you have in mind to be jannah mata air
honestly I cannot wait until jannah kahwin though because like
I will feel so happy for her macam yes
any guy yang dapat jannah is a very very lucky guy
no because you kau tahu pe I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like I don't think jannah will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have ah girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew jannah tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
kan saya ni like shaza really shaza pula jap I mean you deserve the best also but jannah also like deserves the best
it's so merepek
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
orang dekat dia orang like oh have you registered to vote
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
especially kat singapore
woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers
it like it's macam
are you guys have to be woke in order to like macam so you guys don't ah offend siapa-siapa I'm like ugh stop it stop it
macam no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
uh actually women dia orang minta for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time ah seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence ah this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind
nak you pergi terancung
actually for my malay aku dapat A two no but there was only after I retake the malay paper
at first the aku dapat B three
mari lah
belajar otak you still got into so it
tak made a difference many ways was like the two best years of my studying life
and aku don't regret at all
and like it's just so lepak
ya I just miss so much and the lecturers actually do give a damn about you and your welfare not just kau punya studies
um ini apa
most of us tak suka miss judy because she was like so naggy for some reason she was so naggy
I remember ah the time yang bila kita baru dapat result for which company kita dapat for intern and then I didn't get lots but and I was so sad
so miss judy got me out of the lecture theatre and dia just she just tanya me ah apa jadi lah then why why asal I'm crying
I said I didn't get the companies that I wanted to and then she just no it's okay takpe I mean she been didn't say takpe but like it's okay
cederakan diri lah
ketabahan is like her macam patience
add to a certain extent lah that cause kau kan perempuan
you macam shiok seh tiba-tiba
it's I yang bilang
kau takde tissue that time
but but that blood was because you were you were scolding this lelaki yang tengah buang sampah sembarangan kan
she betul-betul seh
just route lain
how come I tak tahu it was a fake story
why your cats like so kasar like that if you train them
oh my god mister alan is just so comel you know
mister mister alan ada snapchat
best gila just shiok you know
eh aku tak sabar to get of the country like it's been so long already since we've been like at home and like just in singapore I'm so I'm really getting bored nowadays
ya then after that they say I don't know I actually didn't read the news so much ah but then nampak macam dorang nak buka like give us masuk like kasi kita masuk tapi macam they just I don't know what I don't know what was what happened ah because I don't really read the berita right but I was like
I mean because no no no dorang dah tutup
for like apa berapa bulan dah so like ya I mean I think ever since like the COVID really boom so much right I think they actually um close it already so like
eh betul ke
sekarang are you sure
jap for real ah
okay I guess I guess that's why I don't know because I mean aku baru kerja masa tu kan always night shift mana ada nak siapa sempat tak lah syafiq kyle not my aku dah aku dah dah sebab tak ada kan because of this COVID dah tak ada drama kan so macam dah
apa what the heck
jap so jap but did you know which one is it because I just know there's like zul ariffin
zul ariffin eh um I think I think he there was ah because you know because of COVID kan dorang tak ada buat drama baru kan like now they are in
sedih pe
okay ah but I never cause because of because of okay not really because of COVID but like a few since like a few years ago kan then I already like because of apa friends punya apa-apa nama dia I I guess influence macam gitu they be like K drama K drama K drama ya that's so
aku eh no I feel like
I mean you got to watch the drama first then after that you will be in love dengan character dia pe
lah cerita lama tak best I mean I don't really watch all cerita lama but I watch lah like at um a few years ago punya kan
I watch like macam
I swear every time he macam oh I don't know what to watch goblin and I'm like bro are you
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right I will never re-watch uh not that I'll never re-watch sebab I wouldn't go until six times three four times
but ya lah because you know after I mean I can lah because you know after watching a show right you can actually macam like you know I don't know about you ah but for me after watching a show or like when I watch this show I feel very attached to the show
boring pe aku tak boleh dok macam tu
wah okay that's is that's a new thing for me like macam a new information of someone
actually now that I think about it aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like macam all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america eh not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last one endgame so I only like I only like apa saw that big big one are the main main shows lah I don't really watch the specific um only
ya like you know got the batman lah all that different different one right so I don't really watch yang macam tu
wah but eh but you know because of COVID also right aku this year aku binge watch banyak gila korean drama
okay jap aku okay first aku tengok doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic kan so it's like macam um is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously ada that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then um I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think kirakan about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay ah ya to me ah so I watched the doctor romantic first lah yang first tu so it was that that show is about apa banyak doctor doctor punya scene ah so it's like banyak so jadi punya tempat punya scene wah you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like eh can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery punya punya apa nama dia what do you call it uh surgery punya
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama punya they are so tip top bro
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors pakai oh my god cantik
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same tau like as in like but it's just that why can't it why macam just macam tak sama tau aku aku pun macam
ya so I was like shit okay so dia cakap ada hotel bloom I'm like sabar am I am I suppose to wait for it macam happen like
so dia macam tak ada tak ada
ada lah yang kan aku ada buat aku tengok doctor romantic two dia ada dua dua
I mean maybe not so because kadang-kadang orang nak kan people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama eh dia banyak international fans tau
banyak gila international fans
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
ya ya you know cerita um my is gangnam beauty
eh park seo joon eh bro my is gangnam beauty yang
ya but it's that apa cerita pun dekat suria then I was like sabar
itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka but I think I remember dulu bila back then also selalu tengok because selalu bila kecil-kecil kan mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada box kan you know the android box that kind of thing
dulu mana ada benda tu semua kan like macam
ya so there's always a singapore nya channel so dah tengok singapore nya channel tu kan kadang-kadang like main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya button tu semua kan so kita tengok ah like some of it macam all the apa nama dia channel one is it yang all that dub basically that thing lah
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember ah when I first like came upon on that that apa channel lah aku macam apa benda sia ni
I think ya oh my god okay even aku rasa even kalau dorang kalau park seo joon cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka
but ya I cannot lah watch that kind of show I just need the original punya
ya but honestly for me also kan kalau tengok um subtitle dengan drama at the same time macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga ah sebab you know you wanna
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm uh is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because kadang-kadang
aku dengar jer kan
kan sama sama
but then but then you know sometimes kalau macam I mean not not um not korean drama also like like anything ah because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like macam make faces so is like macam if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then macam you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I tak faham
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
yo same ah same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix aku tengok malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like whoa what are saying translation ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham seh
tapi like kalau kalau apa malay drama pun kadang-kadang dorang guna all the peribahasa ke or like the
like kalau okay singapore nya tak sangat ah singapore nya
oh my god I love anak metropolitan
youths okay ya so oh my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so gerek
ya but if I'm not wrong anak metropolitan actually ada dua dua season kan dua ke tiga season but the one yang dorang tunjuk kat youtube sebab if I'm not wrong sekarang youtube ada then me watch pun ada tapi aku tak tengok ah dulu kan toggle kan I think toggle pun ada ah but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly ah cause like kirakan dorang punya platform I don't think is that is that apa nama dia friendly is it
then kadang-kadang dorang load lama tau like as in like you know macam kalau nak masuk go inside the app then it will like load quite long to actually show you the page show you the ya
ah ya memang memang macam tu because that time aku kat malaysia then aku nak tengok viu tau then aku tak boleh tengok sebab I'm not in singapore
I guess I guess so that's why macam aku tak boleh tengok so I was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so I'm like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa mana-mana sangat kan so I was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam I thought holiday holiday pun I still got time to watch apa drama kan
ya so macam sedih ah
I guess it's not really holiday it's not really holiday a holiday ah sebab aku kan kat rumah kan macam eh sorry not kat rumah aku kan kat rumah cousin aku aku ada cousin yang tinggal kat malaysia so I go there ah everytime kalau nak gi malaysia selalu singgah sana so that's why ingatkan dah kat sana dah ada wi-fi semua then I'm like shit
ya bro ya I mean see because of COVID mana kita boleh pergi malaysia dok what the heck
ada ah tapi macam just macam isi minyak pastu like beli makan sekejap pastu balik you know that kind of thing so it's not like you go there and like staycation eh eh sorry
huh oh aku tak pernah dok pakai train uh pergi
kau bedek ah five minutes
siak okay from here to aku faham ah tapi it's from woodlands kan
abeh kau apa kat dalam kereta kau just tengok
kau punya phone
eh then they should start making at dok
ya ya ya memang memang eh kapal terbang kot kau bro aeroplane how slow can the aeroplane go
aku actually pergi tu aku um in my whole entire life aku jarang pergi just for leisure
I get no no no because um kirakan selalu aku kan cousin aku tinggal kat seremban kan so aku selalu gi seremban no seremban is like you know um johor then I think melaka then after that seremban
ya you know okay I tell you the furthest from here that means the furthest um country in malaysia is perlis is perlis so right apa um uh is perlis so perlis is near thailand so it's like aku selalu pergi sana sebab aku ada cousin kat sana juga ah not cousin ah but more of like makcik pakcik yang tinggal kat sana cause uh arwah atuk aku dia punya family semua dekat perlis then after that I go there ah sometimes right so um I got this place ah got the padang besar padang besar is like the big ass shopping area kat kat perlis so when you go there right you literally see the border of thailand
ya ya ya ya ya you can literally you can literally see the gate entry of thailand kat apa padang besar tu tau then aku macam sebab that time aku bila aku pergi ah first time aku pergi padang besar tu kan then aku tengok ah aku macam because I was thinking the I think car lah cause kat sana tak boleh it's too packed to take the uh uh apa bus so um I took the car ah abeh lepas tu aku nampak ah
naik sebab aku pergi dengan my cousins and my pakcik makcik ah so it's like banyak orang kan so kita naik bus jadi dah naik bus tu um dari sana dari from singapore kita naik bus till like till like perlis or till like half way through then kita change another bus to um perlis so from perlis kita dah ada kita punya all the makcik pakcik kan so kita just pinjam kereta ah kita kita gi jalan-jalan kat itu so dah pergi padang besar tu aku first nampak aku macam why is this why is there macam apa like thailand punya wordings eh kat sini eh macam what
ya so I was like so so I tanya ah
is that close bro that's why from singapore actually right we can go straight I don't know whether we can go whether we can actually go by car until england kalau tak salah
ya ya ya so so so that means from thailand then after that kalau kau pergi atas lagi then you will be connected to another country lepas tu kau boleh pergi to another country then kau boleh ya ya ya so until england kalau tak salah yang paling yang paling
yang paling jauh ah yang kau boleh pergi ah
ah motor okay ah sebab motor dua-dua orang jer kan so like
right oh my god so it's like you can actually just kirakan ah what is it called uh
you know I wanted to do backpacking cause like macam why not right
but then it's budget ah you cause dah bikin
but backpacking selalu
itu backpacking nama dia
it's I thought backpacking selalunya ah maybe I don't know what's the meaning
I guess no because I thought backpacking is like apa memang bawa minimal barang abeh lepas itu
gi oh my god walking eh
wow just gila aku tak tahu siapa yang sanggup jalan kaki from here to
tu macam apa tau tu macam dah apa uh berapa ribu tahun lepas
weh oh my god jauh though
ya dok even from here to jurong east aku tak boleh dok
I mean tak boleh lah cuma macam the thing the the
bukan tak kind of macam malas gila ah nak jalan ah
that's why so I'm like what the because you know kan aku dulu sekolah dekat jurong east kan so macam like macam I kadang-kadang kan kalau terlupa bus pass ke apa then macam nak kena balik sekolah
itu pasal lah kau ingat eh apa aku dah penat-penat apa pergi sekolah apa aku dah penat-penat sekolah then aku nak kena jalan balik rumah oh my god that will be like so tiring sia dengan bag sebab dulu bila kecil-kecil selalu um bawa bag berat-berat kan so macam I don't why though huh
no wonder I was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
aku ingatkan kau actually apa nama dia kau walk just within the
ya ya and like within within jurong lake garden jer tu pasal aku macam okay lah apa-apa yang
jap siapa punya idea ni
science garden science centre ada park kat belakang
actually kau jalan macam jauh jer
but then bila kau jalan kat reservoir macam jauh tau
asal kau pergi jauh-jauh eh sebab dari sini sebab kalau naik bas ah kau dari sini kau boleh apa I mean that is a bit
then why you have to go science centre bagai
for real ah sebab actually from here kalau kau naik bas ah kau boleh naik I think naik bas tiga puluh kat sini abeh kau stop somewhere near taman jurong abeh lepas tu nanti
ya lah ya lah I mean that's why I was like wondering asal sampai science centre sebab from here but
so it's like ya taman jurong so I'm like dari situ then boleh jalan pe that's why I was like science centre asal seh
ye lah semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau confident sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau eh kau cakap kau dah sampai
ya I mean kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun eh kita semua dah berapa tahun obviously we have to be like independent
wah you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like macam okay so dah nak dekat kiamat kan so like why not I apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap kan kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat madinah ke makkah ke kau tak kan jumpa dengan dajjal kan so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when uh one thing yang aku tak tahu is that dorang cakap that apa nama dia even even orang yang duduk kat makkah dengan madinah um
no no no you dajjal can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the apa malaikat ah so like macam but then the thing is within makkah and madinah there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami tau
in in the end of times ah so there will be so uh because of that tsunami or earthquake it will keluarkan orang-orang yang
beriman gitu ah
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in itu so yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri they will keluar
dorang akan stay inside so that's why yang so that's why I was like thinking abeh kalau macam tu kalau in the end of times kalau aku pergi sana juga then what's the point though sebab because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore kau mana ada experience tsunami or earthquake pun kan
ya you know you know that time aku pernah pergi japan dengan sekolah aku pergi sana for school trip lah kan so then lepas itu aku
oh itu pun
ah australia dorang apa afini uh apa eh tak bukan atikah ella dengan alia dorang pergi melbourne so aku pergi japan dengan puteri dengan ifa so aku pergi sana then lepas tu um kan you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big apa gitu kan so
ya so kita uh yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi hiroshima dengan aku pergi osaka
yes history all that so dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal history kan so dah alang-alang belajar history kita nak kena belajar lah pasal we went to this macam ambulance place eh not ambulance macam fire place gitu to like learn about macam ways to like save yourself from like apa
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually ah we did a earthquake punya simulation
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah I try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
so aku pergi sana aku macam so there's like different different um
apa ya
ya so it's like uh they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us uh yang medium or towards the high a bit just to rasa rasa kan
it's just the tip of the iceberg ah you think just a bit ah gitu kan
it's not the worst ah it's not the level seven ah it's like level four or five gitu ah dia kasi kita try kan kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar siol it's really it's really like bergegar like macam I can't even like
jap so kalau kita
jap okay so kalau kita tengah earthquake ni kan kita boleh masuk sini tak
tak as in like as in like it's not a good place right sebab benda ni kan
right so like macam
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
tak dorang cakap kan because kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk cover kan
ah kau kau guna anything to cover yourself just to like macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau
ya ya ya so because kau punya head yang paling important pe dia yang dia yang control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya oh my god that one sedih juga though kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi I mean okay tapi kau punya kaki dah
ah and like kalau dah penyek kau confirm nak kena amputate
ah itu itu lama gila
ya so that's why a bit scary ah gitu kan
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic lah but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is apa kirakan it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well lah like sekarang
singapore actually dapat
it's good that kita kecil ah cause kalau kita kalau kita besar confirm tak boleh control ah sebab
hmm lagi nasib baik kat singapore ada banyak quite a number of uh hospital kan and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
if I'm not mistaken community hospital yang all the firstly is all the very minor minor punya sickness ah are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing lah
and it's also for people yang from the major hospital transfer to
I mean ng teng fong ada community hospital
ya so that's why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so I guess if I'm not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
so like you can see like all the you know like kalau for houses I don't know if you know ah but for houses kan nanti they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then kalau for hospital they would show hospital punya itu ya so macam from the outside we can
I kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so I was like oh I guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
I mean is sekarang banyak gila foreigner datang sini seh like banyak gila
actually sekarang
wait so bapa kau masih kat sana
alah sedihnya sorang-sorang
oil abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa
ah tapi kalau oil but he's not really in contact with oil lah right he's just like
I mean baju dia kau dah cuci actually that time kan bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja airline kan so dia pun nak kena fix fix all the aeroplane punya stuff right
ah ya it's time kerja cause dia cakap dia balik rumah then dia nak kena tukar baju because apa dia terjatuh oil ya then I was like I was like shit apa bau sia ni
it so strong macam toxic
ya but then actually kalau kau pergi I don't for you but for me aku kalau pergi what is it called petrol station aku suka bau dia
low-key tapi aku macam
ya so but then that time apa dia kena kat dia punya baju kan so baju obviously aku rasa dah in contact with the skin gitu ah
ya so it's like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh
dia macam ah there's one application that I tried is ah mystery shopper
so then they pay you upfront ke or they
that means doing the pharmacy punya side lah but the problem is I have to
I can only work until december but then dia orang cakap cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the uh apa ni we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
mm tapi dekat jems kau
ya I can actually kerja dekat uh sana kan if they can ini but then too bad
that's why then another one I tried is uh apa ni
but that one is uh apa ni that one pun uh ada shift ah seven to
even uh temperature taking also they ask you to apa ni they will ask you to commit for at least
tapi dormitories is very risky because
no because sometimes it's up to the apa tu management to
tapi nanti dia last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before lah macam like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully tak ada change
tapi kalau ada change then susah lah how am I going to call the ini kan the other job
correct that's why I think my colleague kan dia tak nak she doesn't want to do this uh macam because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
ya she requested for a full time tapi bagus kau dia punya because of
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these ah tapi because of dia punya qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's dia dia pun I think on work pass eh
mm because we cannot my current employer dia cakap if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal lah but so just log in apa
it will I think there's some law thingy ah and then kesian kan all these uh
passes holder like because what they are thinking is dia orang nak save on rental
ah then down there tak ada imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
kesian seh
because dia cakap that time kan ah during the COVID period then all these malaysian tak boleh balik
the father passed away a few years back lah so he staying the whole house alone and then dia cakap ah he advertise on gumtree um
apa ni dia cakap ada all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
with aircon and with uh that's it tak keluar pun and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas si azman ni pula uh dia kerja
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself tak kecoh-kecoh you know
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how dia cakap cooking because all male
uh I think five room also ah dekat woodlands
tu dia cakap uh because his pay was uh cut I think about thirty percent eh thirty
thirty percent ke forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he kena cut
but I guess it's okay lah because he's a guy abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik unlike macam perempuan kan suka keluar
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle lah macam ada job ada job tak ada job tak ada job anyway I have extra income
tak boleh order tak boleh keluar makan I mean like once in a while
so that's why then what about your side your company okay tak
those who are urgently need to balik kampung or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
are mostly macam like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya resume apa semua then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
ya I guess tapi ten K eh
she said she rented one condo dekat uh harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
tapi bila sometimes ah when it comes to their private travel ah wah then the the wife can be bossy
that's why sometimes I hear complain from ah macam
ah I also got one experience because apa ni dia punya secretary punya boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then ah uh every year they have this uh macam trip home trip lah so call home leave
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves um so if they don't use and then just rugi lah it's like forfeited
then lepas tu kan nanti along the way there will be changes of course
uh apa ni kenapa deduct eh I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so dia cakap uh did he upgrade or any he asked me to check dia kata bila krisflyer actually deduct salah or what
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything uh we didn't do any claim lah check punya check rupanya wife dia
aku tanya dia uh apa ni so the
ya funny right can you imagine he sekali ah he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what sekali ah the
dia punya wife claim everything siao
ah every time like that nanti karang uh apa tu you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to macam-macam lah
ya because the fare pun if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that uh got no rule ah macam
yes lepas tu the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes dia bising
susah seh but you never know what sometimes ah last minute changes or last minute nak kena pergi sana pergi sini
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't ini
remember that time yang kau punya si ex
terbalik right
aiya for actually for them ah definitely they want to they will apa ni push push to somebody what
book lepas tu tak check and then just give
baru dia cakap don't don't repeat the same mistake
ni apa flight actually you take
no I think it's expensive pasal ah it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
actually ho chin minh ada banyak flight apa vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
other than that ada budget airlines
of course it's not funny lah you crazy macam I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
tak messy sangat pasal kan if you were to do like that ah macam like
macam departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date tau dia bukan macam
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling ah it's very messy so you have to see macam
aku cuma ambil yang departure on the saturday
tak pasal the different website got different allotment why sometimes ah like macam ah agoda they got ten ten room
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked tapi bila you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
tapi actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
tapi okay ah because okay lah macam let's say it's individual booking
I'm sure they have their own bilik tau
nanti they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you tak from this company this company ah so it's easier
I think it's china hong kong tak payah visa
tapi kalau china visa ah
ah apa tu passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
ah you can still it depends ah tapi
kalau if they are travelling around asia pac ah you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
cuma kalau dia declare as tourists then they don't need
tapi tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you lah
but luckily tak payah I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia jump
it's just the you know dia punya screw dia terpleot
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover tapi
the company is like neither here nor there kalau kau apply for a job and let's say you get a job
susah lah
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin punya tu is under recruitment agency no harm just go lah anyway they just want to collect data what
first of all I want to know right shu tu siapa

abang kosh
the sister is dee kosh punya sister
what are influencers influencers buat apa
so am I right to say right am I right to say eh ted bundy pun influencer
ted bundy pun influencer
tapi lifestyle dia orang tapi lifestyle dia orang gerek pe
like more than a hundred thousand subs lah not not that I do or I care lah but macam sekarang
talking to them talking to them very talking about them very poorly lah macam
kau ambil kesempatan kan untuk bual
untuk bual dengan mengumpat orang mengumpat pasal orang then
kau mengumpat mengumpat mengumpat then
you know that you you didn't prepare contingency plan lah furthermore also macam everybody
tapi kau kau pandai kau pandai sangat kan
this kind of content eh the macam
gossipping eh to me right is macam is very normal you know guys gossip
we're keeping it to ourselves whereas macam dee kosh eh he
macam I I actually I I more or less kind of hate most of the
now sekarang
err macam like still remember err the what's her what the fuck's her what the fuck's her name err
ah nicole choo with the ridhwan azman kan macam
actually if you when I think about it again eh when I when I really really think about it again ah macam actually the nicole choo right is not doing anything wrong you know
nicole nicole choo right nicole choo dengan ridhwan eh memang they memang dia orang buat
habis macam they have the drama and then people are not supposed to know about this drama you know but they
then dia orang punya pasal lah then dia orang punya pasal lah then you want to comment right fine lah you can comment you can fine lah you can go ahead
at times right macam I feel that it's err
err from what I know lah macam he made a video like reviewing her reviewing her work
so macam then
look at how macam she got reviewed and all that I mean okay I
to me right to me eh the only wrong right they only wrong eh yang the you only wrong that
if in my very humble opinion lah the only wrong yang dia buat kan is
like my also eh also apasal budak-budak zaman sekarang kan you guys are so drawn right to simple stupid shit
okay is because you all budak-budak zaman sekarang right love nonsense eh like TikTok and
okay if that was the case right can you tell me ah agak-agak kan
what kind of orang kan is selalu buat benda macam ni
what type of what type of what type of orang
like the fact you right the fact is macam
male err like these YouTube celebrities right that's why or like ridhwan right because macam I don't see any of the things that they do right macam
applicable to my life useful in useful useful in my life right or macam I don't see them possessing any characteristics right which I as a man right can look up to and respect ah
although the err macam at fate
manlier than I'm manlier than they are then macam like
what skills that do that they possess what skills do they possess right macam
that's really macam
macam that's really important
but they are not really that funny and then look at their target demographic ah their their target demographic right is macam
is err those macam budak err those macam budak-budak belum sunat gitu
then err macam they budak-budak belum sunat then
so macam I don't think so in a sense right
in a sense eh macam

dia tak nak dia tak nak buka mulut dia so lepas dia abeh lepas tu bila part doctor nak letak macam ubat err sebal kan dia tak kasi dia tutup jer mulut dia all the way sampai bapa dia marah dia
then lepas itu dia macam then he cried like literally he cried he's already nervous after that her his went down to went up to around hundred hundred over plus hundred forty
tapi bapa dia bapa dia macam marah marah dia but then we kita cakap dengan bapa dia lah actually kalau the like normal person sendiri takut so he have to macam he have to understand lah okay encourage dia yang dia uh this is gonna be a you know macam it's gonna be a it's like something new for him also you know
ah siot kita ada lagi lima puluh lapan minit nak kena berbual

he what ah nanti I tell you the story
siapa punya baby
aku tak ingat banyak sangat babies keluar
oh ni kawan aku pindah
ni time chinese new year is it ya it's the other one
dia orang nak test concept eh like concept of a show
oh iya lah
what you have to watch a show first then kalau kalau kau tak suka
ah eh who who are they like new faces ke orang lama tak ada like popular artistes
I don't know I used to I mean like my parents used to watch it all the time right suria so when they have the on kadang-kadang kalau ada show yang macam okay okay then I'll sit and watch ah but to be honest I cannot remember any any specific title
ah ya like it's just like macam background noise gitu
tapi macam I I mean the content okay kadang-kadang like the some documentaries there was one with um that girl dalila I don't know the girl with that cornrow hair
ah dalina dalina during bulan puasa ah bulan puasa macam kadang-kadang like sebelum buka then baru will watch
kalau tak macam err
oh my goodness mentang-mentang ada library eh kat situ dia orang dia orang dengki eh ya
kan aku dah lama seh tak pakai zoom call
oh ya jannah ya ya I can force jannah then kalau kalau aku berbual seorang
oh ya ah you have your but eh then where where is your sister dia tidur kat mana seh
nice eh tengok tengok tengok sikit
tu anjing eh
abeh apa oh lah horse ya allah
anjing eh eh cantik
cantik seh babe is that ros in the photo
oh ya ya betul betul betul
macam-macam lah kau mengarut
oh okay okay cause like right now there's a lot of discussion about kalau you dah age thirty you must have at least hundred K in your bank account that kind of thing
like a a a real high flyer then of course you can save a lot more lah cause right now a lot of like twenty five years old are saying oh I already saved fifty K then you no need to get married meh no need to buy ke you know ya then still spend money what
oh no then sekarang are you actually stress about the wedding or stress about all these things that you feel you're stress about or
aku ingatkan kau fikir banyak sangat ah
ya kalau kalau kalau bukan ros kalau robert kalau alah apa-apa jer lah sebab kau rasa macam robert you know would have the financial means
but the think is russell financial means are also above average jadi you know apa yang tak cukup ni sorry kau
is it dia
right but then cause of COVID and then they say oh people will are only gonna start flying in twenty twenty four then ya lah rasa takut tu mesti ada right sikit
oh okay okay okay that's nice so now your loan amount berapa
eh thirty three dengan hundred jauh beza seh
wah that is okay lah tak apa kau kau cepat-cepat collect then
ya two percent then tak apa lah just pay lah five hundred every month then after that you slowly accumulate your wealth back again and then you can invest the rest what cause you can always make your investment grow more than two percent so that's the logic behind it lah
mana dia nak cari masa nak do relief teaching on the side
ya tu pasal lah then banyak seh burden dia banyak burdens to bear
kesian hais I know
but like what could they possibly be bringing home eh dalam banyak-banyak itu baggage gitu
so so in the end flight tu delay ke tak

it would be nice to like tengok balik like now like ten years ago we will think it's like macam
then you will just buang and then ten years later you like eh oh apa jadi with my thing and then you will rindu it
you can find cari satu soalan
remeh hmm I don't know the makna of that

eh wait wait kejap eh
alamak okay maaf
I think I know siapa
eh but kesian if like you ya
I don't know what's my alasan
dislike someone but I feel like my alasan is like like I won't
tak suka but I just like
a bit I mean macam tak tak enjoy like
oh when they jalan and then the feet
tak angkat you know and then they're dragging their feet
ya then when especially if the orang is wearing some squeaky shoe or like the slippers
that is like longgar and then you can hear every single step they are taking
oh can okay drama okay ni drama like
okay actually at the beginning I thought I won't like suka the drama because macam very
pelik like that but then I watched it then it's damn good
ya so the story is macam a doctor actually it's not a doctor it's okay it's an alien who is who calls himself doctor lah and then ah he finds somebody like some orang from
and then he will bawa the orang and then they will uh
travel together in like a blue kotak you know a kotak biru and then they will fly through space and time
stuff that is like luar like
it's um it's a bit macam action but like
I feel macam ada like the disney show undertone so it's like every episode ada lain
I don't know how to explain ah I thought it's actually macam merepek at the start
tengok aje and then I finish I finish err three seasons or something but the one of the seasons macam
the character macam menyampah and I cannot stand her and I always want to sepak her so I just skip the whole a bit first season
oh I understand I faham
I agree but sometimes I don't even tengok like the anime but I dengar the music is like wow

betul but like you cannot lari from it anyway so it's like you deal with it
bertitik tolak okay let's see
the soalan macam tak fun
hmm duit
if duit is percuma then tak payah beli apa-apa
percuma is for you only
ya cause tinggi what
wait isn't like macam the the the kasut
you know my I cannot find my size at like the kedai
it's quite sad ya then selalu I will buy like oh uh
like selalu the size will will only like naik until forty
ke apa then my size is like forty one kalau if you follow the rubi size
then I'm like aww but all the kasut is like cantik and then I cannot like muat then I'm like huh
mm oh my god last time I was searching for a pair of kasut for like my work
the other time like last year or something and then I actually uh duduk at the rubi for like
satu jam and then I was opening and hooking and unhooking the kasut from the shelf and then the shop owner look at me like huh you want to buy or not
then I legit do that for so long and then I end up tak beli apa-apa then I just left the store
ya I think they look at me like I was about to curi the kasut or something
and then I diri there and I was going to check in lah then my phone semua then I was scanning the safe entry then my safe entry macam lagging so
I tunggu there for like three minutes or something because my internet macam
tak bagus and then you know the ilahui person keep going up to me then they keep saying oh welcome welcome for like two minutes straight then I'm like huh what like
one welcome cukup already don't need to say welcome for so many times then I legit like menyampah you know I don't even want to go inside the shop after they welcome me for like two minutes
it's legit the only like the the dua worker in the store and like everyone who works in the store basically just like went up to me to say welcome
so like menyampah eh I'm so paiseh and annoyed at the same time
oh that's teruk
oh what did you beli during eleven eleven did you buy anything

maybe what if you like uh you want to okay let's say you don't beli if you do something and then you get one free like uh you marry one wife and then you get another one for free
eh that's like uh you get a kembar
oh my god what if the what if the couple macam
suddenly keluar kembar and then what are they going to do if they already prepare for only one child and then the other budak eh

there so macam uh dia punya family eh the the parents I mean she got a key lah because like she's the oldest so she got key then the parents got key
say wah really ah then we thought like we thought like macam
err rumah biasa tau macam just like err rumah empat bilik ke tiga bilik then she say no lah it's a double or three storey then like
no haven't that time almost we want to go but then like macam our schedule doesn't fit
macam got cancelled because of like I think one of two or them couldn't make it
ya ya then then she say that time she she got go back like um apa ni
ya she got two one one is very younger then the second one is like macam teenage
like in a way macam I don't know lah I don't I think they with the sisters but then she she the one that uh want to go first or something like that
I think I think got some wedding then they will stay there then oh I think the nenek
the nenek also was there the nenek lives there or something like that
mm plus eh tak payah tak payah tak tak
it's like apa tu what they say is it investment
like the higher rank one they they do that macam they they buy a condo because their pay is already high what so they they buy a condo
apa ni ya
I think they see also lah macam what kind of like background
family members support also you know macam like they like oh okay lah I got this amount like I
boleh tak start balik
okay I have a friend in in lah so macam they are they are brought up in a very err
ya so like macam
so like macam most of them um
they want to like go to like macam apa ni
so like macam wah like very interesting like they have they know that it's already like fixed you know
so I like wah so so lucky then like they like very chim know then like macam
susah sangat eh
ya if if they want if I mean like if they want to macam
work in a line where requires like or masters then okay lah but then I feel like macam
the type of work or like macam what you want to do
so it's like more of like macam
he was like uh telling me afiq actually kan um degree tak tak perlu sangat lah macam like if you want you want lah I mean like
huh my my senior ah my senior dia cakap actually at first also I want to take degree then bila fikir balik macam
um waste uh not not not say waste of time lah macam like you you need more money what to pay you school bills and all
apa tu enhance or like
like he can just like get in already because of the experience that he get macam like his
ya so first half is um local then macam I think around four months lah four months is overseas
so I got a double cert macam
like uh apa apa apa apa lah
in half a year and usually like that kind of thing take like macam a few years or like macam in one year ah
tunda lah kahwin ho then dapat anak dah empat puluh
chey sedih seh tu tak lah
no lah it won't this one ya tiga puluh
eh lelaki dengan perempuan masalah tau
ya eh really I mean like macam okay for for the girls eh
I mean like of course like we as guys like we want anak or what
then imagine kalau like you know that you can't um produce anak
then like it's another thing then you feel like macam
family tree ya ya zuriat wow
I wanted to say zakat zakat different thing sia
imagine if like your jodoh is like a older like for me eh a guy my jodoh is a older girl
or females is more like macam I feel that uh like girls kan macam like now the this like our generation kan
but I feel that now like macam they want to
unless ya unless your pay is like macam ada commission that kind
macam not
so that's why you need to have a back up ah macam like
satu ribu tu like for the longest time
ah then your the one that you saved up confirm [dah] makin lesser what
like a heads up eh macam now people start to think oh I need a like a back up plan I need savings that kind of thing
unless your company have like macam monthly pay cause uh ya cause like
um one of my friend uh apa ni
err dia kerja events so like monthly she got like a fixed pay of like two point five
uh apa ni she
um jobs ah macam like ada commissions so macam they give a lot of like commission things tau so she need to do a lot of like
so macam she will take in the other
uh person punya slot
so like okay let's say like macam you you already have a thing to do
then after that but still the commission will like the double commission tu will like
ya so so like macam it will add up lah it will add up to one commission in the end but then that commission can like
macam whatever they sell they will get like a few percent of it
gila kan
ya lah she untung lah
two no not cawangan err
so that this group will do some of this group punya work then this group will do like ya
crazy lah so macam like
ya but then of course the the shit that they go through like banyak masalah lah ya
ah sembarang ambil
uh got lah got but then um macam if you need to work
you really need to macam you need to put your work first like that
instead of like family of what which is the point like my friend macam
at a point of time she give up she wanted to like macam just um quit
so like macam
ya but you really need to stand for your right lah even though macam that pay is good ke apa kan but you must know your
so that the their apa ni the one that will take over them
ah dia orang punya anak will not have
so that macam like in like some people have like emergency money what
oh at that time uh they have a saving so they were sharing with me lah and my family macam they have a saving
uh okay their emergency is like so weird it's like macam okay emergency like wedding
like dia punya anak wedding
exactly macam okay like let's say macam
err last minute um the the anak couldn't pay for certain things kan
err then macam they need to help out in a way like that kind of like emergency lah
ah macam like those those small things macam like maybe uh venue
ah macam like
not it bukan bukan lupa bukan lupa but then she couldn't pay
because she's okay her ikat tunang
ah ah that one I don't know ah okay dia punya ikat tunang is two years
so I think she like macam want to get uh married lah already lah macam more earlier so they push like one year plus
then the mum was like think like saying are you sure I feel do you have like enough saving already then she say err nevermind lah buat simple simple
so like everything was like tergantung then the mum keep asking have you paid have you paid have you do this have you do that then she said oh ya ya ah later lah later lah then
but her side is already then she like macam
take it very lightly so I was like thinking kau nak kahwin ke tak nak kahwin ni kau serious ke tak serious ni
then I mean like if you want simple then just like nikah then makan sikit-sikit ah this one she do like a sanding sanding
then like got this and that I mean like macam okay the the quality is not as like
you know this girl ah she everything she tangguh tangguh tangguh then after that
cannot take it already the mum like there's no updates or anything then the mak ask her
then she like err ya actually ni nak kena bayar lagi berapa ribu gini then the mum like
then the mum the mak don't want to say like she got money to help
then her mum actually um help out lah in a way like macam a few percent of the
ya only like maybe like nikah lah
I think it's a that's what like every parents want nak ah ya because like even my mum also like
uh don't want lah we make uh some some somewhere that is like macam bigger ke apa lah
then like if more bigger means more money then she said err tak apa lah err I mean like
I can help you to help you like settle this or that then like of course my brother is like the first child so he don't want to like macam burden my mum
so but then my mum wants it so like macam
dia dilemma lah whether to do or not when she said then then the girlfriend um ya the girlfriend also like
said thinking like macam
uh tak apa lah kita buat simple simple you know gini gini but then like my mum want it to be like
um sempurna lah in a way looks good like people side
ya so like macam but the family is quite small
so okay so like macam not a lot from her side then from my brother side my brother really thought was like okay I will invite like less err he will be inviting like less than a thousand of people
macam maybe six hundred or five hundred depending on ya dah how many
know like macam
ya ya see kalau ada kemampuan lah I mean like ah ya then that ya then that's the that's one of the emergency money
and then like after that like macam maybe house or what
like macam
uh so that's why like macam
and plus like macam it depend how you
investment eh apa tu namanya um
like macam like you will get money if you
like insurance like that tapi you will get monthly money ah
no macam every month you pay something then after that you will receive um
ya tak
that's why I mean like definitely we want to adult with a clean way like macam a clean way of saving money or like getting investment kan
masing-masing ah eh masing-masing
kalau tak okay ah
dia dia curi daripada bapa dia then she give me I don't know then um err got caught lah got caught by the teacher teacher teacher cause we went to the next block only like this is the primary school the next block she saw because the staircase is like
bocor gila then um apa ah dah kena tangkap then her family lah her family kena called what kena called they came down ah they came down where you get the cigarette ah apa adik curi daripada bapanya I was like

at first they say okay err they give me a choice lah I don't know why ah they give me a choice but to my friend they never gave a chance they straight away call I think because is not her first time ah because that one is really my first time then err terus my my cikgu datang ah she she was like she's a very nice principle lah she eh no that one is principal not teacher she came to me like okay I'm going to give you a choice is either you go home tell your parents about what you did today
err dulu I like to mix around with like eighteen year olds because dulu kan eighteen year old boleh beli kan last time I mix around with eighteen year olds people then they smoke then I was like eh I was like eh I want then my senior was like
not really stole lah he just left it out then he was drunk then I was like oh you know what if I take he's not going to know ya then err then my senior was like okay kalau kau hisap rokok kau ambil ah so sorry then um I came down lah we came down lah they give me then we smoke I was like wah hisap rokok tapi tak tarik tau then I was like err because this one is called tarik
if tak tarik is like you receive the smoke is more thicker
ya so that point of time I was like just like that lah I never like like that so they was like err and they were like um okay then they teach me lah how to tarik then I was like eh feels much better but I cough a lot lah
man apa ah err ya lah then they taught me how to smoke then we start to smoke smoke until I get to buy my own pack I tried my best twenty next year baru twenty one ya but now I still lepas lah but then ya
tak sometimes is your ya I think because of my body size that's why dia orang macam okay okay can can because I have the body of mak-mak punya orang macam last time last time but now I am like I I went back to skinny then I went back to like this now
and my thighs thighs memang susah nak hilangkan ah
takpe takpe exactly now with my father lah my father cakap eh kau ni gemuk apa lah semua tu that time I blast out at him like this is my body I'm your daughter you don't have to body shame me
no matter what exactly oh my god that is like damn offensive then everyone is like oh my god malunya then err that time I blast out at him lah like this is my body as my father you cannot just body shame me in front of others like
exactly and kau kurus pun is not in a healthy way so kau nak aku kurus apa ikut cara kau then is like oh my god I'm so frustrated then my father was like
like keep quiet ah dia macam serba salah gila then he minta maaf lah it's like bapa minta maaf ah I'm very sorry for what I said to you then sekarang dia start balik cause I want to take err license uh motor punya license so he at first ah dia memang tak kasi dia larang dia larang gila babi then I ask from my mum my mum kasi then I told my dad lah like asal mama boleh kasi bapa tak boleh kasi then he
he was like huh mama kau kasi kau permission cause my mum and dad cerai so bila nak dapat decision memang susah gila ah then err apa ah then my dad said okay fine kalau kau betul-betul nak ambil lesen kau kuruskan badan kau dulu then I was like you know what okay asalkan dia kasi me that macam only way
macam okay kau nak aku kurus fine I do anyways lah like any way that I can do like tak makan ke apa anything but last time I never eat for almost two months I was damn thin that's why I say when last time I err I was not fat
biscuits that's all ya light snacks only ya lah if that's the only way he can let me take license right you know what I'm just gonna do it not just not to eat lah I mean like just be skinny for him to macam okay fine kau dah boleh ambil lesen
why not mm look look at your friends your friends all poly right I'm still like those macam you know so I like motor since young cause I grow up with my aunty what then her anak
is a the first the first child was a guy so I look up to him as I grew up lah and then the motor ya he ya I'm the only child ya then dia ada motor he is very successful lah like alhamdulillah dia successful then dia pun dah kahwin then bini pun
anak pun dah dua macam okay lah you know what I'm just gonna be like him lah he he is a major in err I think major sergeant ah I don't know in in his army ya cause he signed on ya
that one is navy navy lagi susah malay navy lagi susah
oh okay err oh shit about the army oh my god so now I I want to be a I want to join in the army also as a female yeah I want to go to all guys there yang perempuan ni actually boleh buat semua macam gitu
I know how to self-defence like siapa-siapa nak pegang kan try me like seriously I learn a lot how to self-defence with guys lah cause dah banyak kali kita dah take advantage but then I learn how to be stronger lah belajar belajar belajar belajar pang satu kali ni this guy ah dia nak try one time shoot he run away he was like like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one yang nak ambil advantage punya he he tried to macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua then I was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can lah can lah terus I give up like okay kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa I give him one punch at his face because I was
that one I don't care lah like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me ke buang uh me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done lah and dia pangkat sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant punya rank lah so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did buang so whatever he did to me he will get back lah ya
I don't know the way that is not like err being like disrespectful disrespecting lah I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad lah kirakan cause he's the one that create us what so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with allah like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like bukan macam eh lu macam muak no
that's exactly ya that is like ya allah tolong lah jangan lah buat macam gini you know like please lah please lah at least that one he knows macam because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know macam like berbual maki ya allah you know that
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those hijab people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay ah macam you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear hijab and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant blah blah blah no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
same sama ya true true
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect memang betul kita semua bukan perfect pun
so is like something is even orang yang very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam oh wow kita aku rasa aku betul ah tapi orang lain tengok macam eh actually dia ni apa sia dia buat a'ah sia salah sia padahal sendiri fikir macam oh baik baik baik
tapi nanti bila dah live a long life already fikir balik macam like oh my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that lah like so sekarang for the mak and minah I feel sorry for them ah because they maybe tak dia kurang ajar
pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a minah and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a minah
I can be a minah I can be a mat I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and allah give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to macam you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes kita tak macam we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but padahal macam pada kita is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to macam sugarcoat everything macam oh wow you are doing so great eh takpe ah kau pakai hijab tak tutup err apa apa ni leher takpe lah lupa melayu sikit takpe ah kau tak tutup pun takpe eh takpe ah tak pakai tudung ah kau pakai tudung dengan sleeveless pun tak apa eh kau nak main bola pakai tudung
never heard of that but ya like semalam dah cakap ah it's like okay that kind of teguran is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like wow
eh example like macam wah farah so nice ah she everytime sugarcoat me ya but padahal farah itself is like
exactly uh like seriously I feel so malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri
eh oh my god kalau tak jadi riak pun allah tak terima sia so allah sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat so the more you share to people macam eh kau tahu tak aku solat sia eh lima waktu sia
okay then what you want me to do macam oh wow you confirm go to heaven lah what you expect exactly so is like oh my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite quran ah a lot of time macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam eh kau dah khatam belum like aku dah khatam sia
I'm like okay you can at least say like macam okay kalau if your friends like haven't khatam and you have already khatam like at least two times three times you can just ajar that person macam okay lah aku tolong kau lah aku bimbing ah apa aku akan jadi your guide lah
guidance okay so kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam K lah aku jadi cikgu engkau lah aku dah khatam banyak kali like you don't have to say that macam okay lah
like for example I haven't khatam you already khatam then I'm like I really want to khatam because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of um like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then farah came up to me like example lah macam uh do you need help like kau belum khatam kan sebab aku baru khatam so kau perlukan bantuan tak at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay ah boleh tolong tak
macam you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like oh my god like memalukan gila lah serius serius like tuduh ke
oh my god anda tak faham tu jer boleh cakap
mmhmm ya then is like okay lah if you want to be jealous because of a good thing is is actually good ah actually macam tak bersalah is not meant to be judge
alamak aku dah baca quran dah berapa tahun tapi dia baru dua dua bulan dah habis dah khatam macam
ya exactly I was like eh bukan ke tadi kita berbual pasal motor um sports bikes or street bikes

so mama you already you know right that kakak kan suka makan ayam goreng right and then lately kakak macam makan popeyes sebab I think popeyes punya ayam goreng is way nicer than what do you think
popeyes punya ayam is more crunchy eh I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye punya like lebih sedap
and then compared to punya tak sedap langsung I mean like it's it's it's nice
lagi-lagi like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
but then you still have to wear your mask macam susah and then it's also tak fun langsung sebab
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people macam complain
dia susah to dapat the vouchers sebab ada berapa banyak website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website tu then in the process semua pun macam very sulit and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think kalau tak salah first of december
I don't know eh I think so like I saw at kita punya void deck they put the poster everything then they say um start date thirtieth this monday lah thirtieth november until like
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean kemas and then the after is yellow very dirty then macam macam asyik lunyai and everything so ya
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask tak boleh dipakai so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that dia punya paint very faint very thin macam acrylic dia it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with err like a bit more macam like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last mah so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very rugi because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag banyak all my stuff so ya I don't know see how lor even if I buy like um the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so tak tahu ah macam mana
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then kalau tak habis then I will be rushing then susah if I rush because
I think so ah that one also not so sure you have to check with the ustazah again
ya the water sports sounds fun ah but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so tak tahu macam mana
until june two thousand and twenty is kalau tak salah the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
um chop chop type of person ya you know so kena we all nak buat macam cepat-cepat because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then dapat rehat cepat so ya
I think you can ask adi if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got madrasah tomorrow
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog goreng or like fishball like that
the epok-epok also just now err orang sebelah kasih also like very nice also
but the epok-epok like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very garing
I think like the epok-epok when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old chang kee one cause it's like
err taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat sebab dia banyak inti and then dia pun macam dia pun macam very crunchy rangup like that
but it was like very little but got flavour lah and then macam very sedap macam rasa macam those ondeh-ondeh cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then macam very manis and everything then I cannot tahan also
the apam I ate and
oh then I don't know cause the apam was actually supposed to be one for me and one for adik but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if adik ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the bhatoora
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the apam
and then the the kuah from the bhatoora also still have
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to tuang it's on the bhatoora
doing hummus right tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan hummus
macam sedap seh
oh ya baklava also very nice baklava with like teh O sedap seh
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then bila dah nak makan then macam rasa dia berbeza cause orang lain yang buat
so ya macam tak tahu ah like
oh I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream macam tak
ya the whipped cream it's like macam it's not like serasi in that not not not serasi it's like tak equal like that bila dia spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
I think the satay when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the lemak and then you know the satay punya minyak ah like that right and then you eat with the lontong the bawang timun everything then you cecah in the kuah very sedap and then macam
ya the babat I thought the babat satay I wouldn't like but when I ate it bila masih panas kan sedap gila then macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan
I think the I don't know for me was the nasi was nothing special it was like nasi minyak like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice ah but the they have the like the sambal not the sambal but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli makan dengan green chilli gitu with the nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam crunchy crunchy gitu
but the daging very nice macam makan gitu macam sendiri because it's very easily peel off then macam very sedap
and then macam the minyak right I was thinking if like if kalau kat rumah sendiri right the nasi you put in the minyak then you panaskan you buang you buat macam nasi goreng like that
not a lot of flavour but like just the daging taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli makan tepi gitu
but the sad thing is the vegetables dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit jer the lettuce and everything ya
sebab if I have a lot then macam makan pun macam tak segan right then can put and wrap everything nicely
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then nasi then we still have a bit of the serunding right
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and serunding will taste nice so I think macam beli lettuce atau cabbage gitu kan serunding and then buat macam wrap wrap gitu then sambal belacan and then a bit of macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak
no eh I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so nak beli barang tu semua but maybe we all like
keluar keluar to cause hari ni is
uh naomi's birthday and then like we all thought macam
uh kita pun terlupa then it's like oh then we just okay lah december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
err kailey and ayumi the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like macam
to cause like dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya timetable semua very busy right so nak jumpa and then macam makan sama-sama or something then that time I told you me and ayumi we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right dia belanja because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what ah see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped kena find orang baru ah don't know how see first
bet the person bought lebih sedap daripada you beli because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then macam
tak was-was also nak makan
so ya then kalau you beli besar pun like knowing you you know like you makan one slice then you can simpan if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like lemak manis everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit lah because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one wah very nice I rugi they never buy the apple flavour
if not then go eat at hajjah maimunah or something sana kan sedap and then like
it's besar so dua orang makan kenyang
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like belanja her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like macam treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
minum teh like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you boleh makan kat situ macam tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where macam dia orang makan ah you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
uh my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the uh tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also dia minum macam sedap
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive lah but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan catch up with one another
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like buka the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think kalau tak salah it's
the desserts all like really nicely macam betul-betul sedap-sedap they got assortments macam like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain macam susah nak pakai voucher ni sebab you tak tahu really macam mana nak pakai you tak tahu hotel mana accept hotel mana tak
the ya then macam got a few cafes lah if not also the
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like bugis or something to lepak and berbual-berbual kat situ because atmosphere pun shiok and then makanan pun actually really not bad and then nowadays bugis area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I makan burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
tapi if like that macam susah because from the look of it susah nak travel sebab pasal COVID and then I read up they said that kalau nak travel pun sekarang dah ada banyak measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so macam susah like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but sekarang pun macam end of year pun belum lagi okay everything macam we are still kalau tak salah in phase two
so macam I don't know ah quite susah
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian bakso sedap seh dengan macam chilli sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi roadside makan-makan gitu
dengan dia orang punya soda gembira everything and then the atmosphere orang-orang rokok everything
I want the murtabak manis
oh ya this whole year takde pasar malam seh
luckily my school has some of the pasar malam food like takoyaki all and then like cantine all have the goreng pisang goreng keledek all so okay lah can still tahan but the you zha kueh burger ramly all wah I really miss keropok lekor
and then the susu honeydew tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air sugar cane dia orang suka seh tu rindu seh
and then drink with mango lassi over there sedap seh that time we drink with the mango lassi woo masam tapi manis
ah ya that time yang deepavali that one that adit left halfway
like you see like I never used before right then I was oh okay then didn't think about it then I was like eh rezeki sebab my face wash also nak dekat habis then I actually wanted to buy my new face wash then I saw got new face wash already I was like okay lah can
but I don't think adik will use because adik very particular about his face
oh ya then the perfume nenek give right the bau right stay for very long eh
one after zohor like one two masih ada bau dia like it's very faint but tapi masih ada bau dia and then nenek punya
the lipstick and bedak muka right I pakai right wah it's like eh very nice because the thing is like bedak muka I wanted to I was like I I I
bedak muka I already because like my foundation I needed something to set and then when she gave it to me I was like okay I can use it and then like I used right and then her lipstick I was like eh like wow okay very nice very like very comfortable lah then I was like okay this is like my nenek
no no no the lipstick colour you know dulu dulu nenek has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
then I looked at it right I was like wah actually my lipstick colour and my nenek punya lipstick colour about the same ah because like
nenek wear lipstick like that so I was like wah okay and then when I wore it and then the bedak muka eh okay
but then I didn't dare to share with my friend because like my friend was like asking can I use then I was like no cannot this one my mum punya
in school relax sikit lah ah cikgu tak minta banyak
oh ya ke
so basically in school hari ini kita start sekolah pukul um nine

oh saya tahu
sebab saya
it's all on food if food is free and can be replaced with something rather than duit then err
ya I will boleh jimat banyak sangat ah
clothes boleh like kadangkala jer boleh splurge
for me it's err mengada-ngada
err ya other people like example macam service crews cikgu
that one itu tak boleh tahan ah
kalau dia orang betul-betul like
tak tahu like boundaries like as sebagai
spam jer lah nanti besok pagi dia tengok all of your messages
boyfriend kita semua kat army
like semua benda like the system capitalism semua sudah tak ada
then you will bring about chaos lah sebab semua orang akan like fikir
like of their own selves like in ways where they can survive so for example macam food semua food resources
tak ada system ya
so some would tamak kan
so dapat uh apa tu will definitely
dia orang will definitely be selfish lah of like whatever resources they can get
and it will eventually macam create havoc
so as much as capitalism semua orang cakap macam tak bagus it's like much needed in the

then then we balik awal
like suddenly a lot of people main layla sia then after that like I don't know she got stronger
so macam layla
eudora eudora eudora pun sama
then siapa lagi
ya a lot of like older older players ah they revamp then macam nowadays
a lot more punya yang we don't use last time macam layla
enam puluh dollar on the game I have no words I am
okay okay lah I mean aku pun spent on harbour so aku tak boleh cakap banyak sangat
let's start playing again ah cause like aku pun nak try naik balik tau cause aku drop sampai like aku from mythic sia mythic you know abeh aku drop so it's like
the fact that okay okay asal kan asal kan kau bahagia ah eh asal kan kau bahagia
I don't think they revamp karina cause macam I don't see a lot of people playing karina so but you can always try then mana tahu kau dah baca kau punya itu build builds semua kan mana tahu kau boleh jadi pro karina so ya and ya it's not as toxic surprisingly lah aku tak tahu asal which is weird lah cause normally kalau cause I always play mage dengan support right then I whenever aku play ah I aku punya sekarang pretty bad ah like noob lah noob so bila
noob ah and ada slurs so macam
nowadays they don't like last time they they ada lah they got say
all the mean words but now they don't eh surprisingly so macam
eh kirakan kau natural born gamer lah ini oh my god

so kirakan kau just take advantage of this the rank lah ini
suka eh mentang-mentang dia dapat asyik asyik menang jer dapat increase kau punya wing rate and everything err

aku tak bagus ah aku tak boleh main fighter apa aku jadi fighter macam macam
like real seh everytime aku jadi fighter kan confirm confirm aku mati banyak so it's like a no no but ya that dragon is pretty good macam dia punya ulti kan you basically become dragon
okay lah I don't know what's the term lah cause I'm not as nerd as you but um jadi dragon then right nanti okay dia actually kecil tau dia punya character tak besar sangat then bila dia lepas jadi dragon dia dah collect macam don't know what is it called I forgot apa five whatever it's called
then um meet gordon besar sia dah macam
dah macam besar lah besar ya but I think ya you should play you should play that one or
I mean kau pernah main apa and it's when you play freya bagus lah
so macam maybe at that point of time the the the the the the player wasn't as good lah weren't as good but I think if kalau kau
kalau kau just keep on go kan and main more games and practise right confirm kau boleh jadi top sia hear already knowing how nerd you are
then dia punya balmond bagus sia
legit legit super thick like macam susah nak susah nak bunuh dia
and dia pandai main dia tak macam kau macam dia punya ulti kan dia tak hit minion
dia dia tau pandai nak hit so macam I get I get it but it's okay I know baby steps baby steps
actually tank right I think kau pakai hilda atau masha is good lah I mean ya we've talked about it hilda atau masha
aku kalau aku kalau fighter atau tank tak boleh
cause like aku tak I'm not the kind to step up lah aku aku tiada pendirian lah sia
paksa kan nampak

pasal aku baca kan aku tak tahu sangat kan so macam uh aku just tekan dengan smash button macam dengan kau punya freya
so macam it's quite fun
okay lah but yang kau aku tak tahu sangat itu hero ah so I have no say lah but it's fun lah it's just fun to play him
like walaupun dia macam gitu kan tapi macam
susah bunuh dia lah basically uranus and then they also ban aldous aldous aldous ya and they also ban helcurt
I mean from my recent experience ah chey recent experience but really lah macam that time recently I play
abeh dia orang ban ah dia orang ban helcurt dia orang ban
dia orang ban uranus dia orang ban aldous
then they also ban siapa eh
kau tahu ling
then they also ban siapa eh
lunch ah cause I'm thinking if I should take half day leave atau sorry okay girl gotta earn some money
eh ini okay I'm totally gonna like
tukar kerja chey just kidding
weak such a weakling then cakap jer banyak tapi action tak ada action ada so tidak apa lah kita just layan kan kita just okay okay nak gym eh okay
tengok ah dia nanti dia macam eh sorry ah
penat ah eh sorry lah
ngantuk ah
kau sengaja eh but okay okay maybe okay lah I just take the whole day leave lah
ada dekat-dekat ada andes lah ada kan
so should be fine lah and nasi-nasi itu semua where got time for nasi we go western
wait no just kidding I need my nasi I am
I need my nasi
okay tak sangat lah
kita tak cakap pasal staycay seh kita just cakap pasal
ah penat
apa seh but
eh no okay actually we meet we've been planning to meet so many times but selalu it's either macam dia penat satu penat satu malas atau just macam
wrong timing lah everytime aku ajak
so macam okay lor
but we are fine with hanging out together lah kau step jer mana kau punya glue glue alamak kita boleh hang out sendiri lah chey just kidding
so just lepak lah basically eh but but we wanted to go trampoline kan so it's like
kita rest on the first day then second day we just go trampoline all the way so we go morning you want to go gym then after that
I was like eh abeh korang pergi gym dah lah gym boleh dua orang jer abeh aku
so macam I boleh lah korang nak pergi gym pergi lah but then maybe aku just I don't know go for a run but
aku tak tahu that area okay I am not very familiar
container dia pun bukannya besar sangat kan
okay never mind we just make do with what we can okay on that day so we just see how it goes because I aku pun tak nak I just don't want you guys to macam
you know like I don't want you guys to in the morning leceh have to go for gym also I mean it's quite tiring right if we sleep then in the morning I mean it's refreshing in the morning lah of course but
right we're going to cook breakfast right then we cook breakfast then we mandi eh we mandi first then we cook breakfast
container macam you already bought the container mah
bought eh as in like I don't know lah aku macam nak stay in the container
the other end is dhoby ghaut right eh salah
okay what quite dekat what actually
so that's the first plan the second option is the one yang itu lah yang
cause from trampoline park right we'll be sweaty already if we want to go other place aku takut
I mean even if we tukar baju and everything we still busuk mah like we still feel very icky and sticky
bro oh my god okay if that's the case then kita punya our breakfast we just eat mcdonald's lor you can lah can lah not not so eh okay what mcdonald's one of the days
hey the what a hater I mean come on sponge isn't supposed to masak also you know come on now
oh sorry I don't go there I don't know about all this stuff because macam macam I see what's in front of me so my little pony is cute like that is cute like that there's nothing go behind it unless you really go make your reason
sudah eh
adalah kaedah get in the workers are you get everyday
kuih suji is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause uh it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like berat it's just so heavy and
like really tak kisah like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
you the minah that's very bising
why would I wash my selimut
I think kita boleh start sekarang
tak macam pelik eh buat benda macam gini
you said that you nak berbual pasal
rumah baru kan
okay so rumah baru tu I was thinking
ah initially kan saya nak buat yang
colour kelabu tu kan yang colour grey
entah eh kadang-kadang saya pasal that time saya tengok Pinterest then lepastu
ah apa tu
saya nampak dorang buat macam this deep green punya colour dia macam
royal green punya colour
ada dia macam deep very
dia macam not dark green tau dia macam
emerald green gitu
okay you see this ni kan light kan dia macam something like this
no this one this one yang hujung ni
but it's not very dark what dia macam okay okay jer
so I thought that colour untuk kita punya apa tu
kat mana hall
dalam bilik feature wall kat mana seh
but then our apa err headboard for the bed kan nanti cover feature wall you cover half already what
on top then might as well you taruk frame
entah apa-apa painting ah yang cantik-cantik ke you go and buy kat Spotlight ke
ya habis siapa nak paint
no lah tak jatuh punya lah
okay I ada this idea tau one
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway yang ah okay sekarang it's
right then lepastu ada macam this narrow pathway
ah that pathway kan ada one wall
ah that wall yang now is the study table punya corner yang taruk printer
because sana kan ada um
dia macam ada mini table
and then bawah dia is all drawers
remember makcik tu buat
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized ataupun A five-sized frames
so if if it's a walkway I tak nak
no dining table is still kat ni pe uh entrance
sebab apa tau the
if you put raised floor dekat depan entrance
exactly orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then macam
okay so kat sini is one area
is macam an area of its own
then macam you don't want to talk across like that
so might as well leave it as dining area ah because anyway it's nearer to the dapur what then once you masak-masak kat dapur then you just keluar kan then it's sebelah jer
tak payah nak bulky bulky punya dining table
ah because right now dia punya dining table bulky gila
ye lah ye lah lepastu
dia punya tingkap area is the triangle one kan yang ada bucu kan
ah can ah yang itu yang bucu nya area kita buat raised floor
so at least dorang ada seating area kat situ then you can put you can put books lah or whatever you can put your playstation kat sana if you want to play games
then you don't need to semak kan the living room
because you kalau dah main start main game cam playstation kat
but workstation if kat triangular punya bucu I don't think it work because dia banyak pakai space
and dia punya space tak ah
okay so you can easily duduk lah
almari yang in-built tu
oh ya cakap pasal swing
if we install a swing that mount daripada ceiling
over the years kan nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
cam combine weight lah
nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
dalam house seram hor
saya macam banyak imagination kalau swing gitu
nanti macam ye lah awak kerja malam
then saya sorang sorang kat rumah
which we we want to buy also what you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio punya machine
no seh I malas nak pakai tudung jogging kat luar
tak nak ah swing macam
seram pula nanti malam-malam alone
living room saya nak gi toilet dapur asyik nampak jer benda alah tu
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because dia save space and it looks neater
kita baru move in what
why do you want to alih-alih kan
why you want to alih
if you take it down then you you you jalan wire right and then you just move the mount lah you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole yang kat lama punya wall you just paste it lah you cover
ah okay faham
but let's say you want to alih you want to alih where where you want to move it
then after that is already the wooden punya punya fake wall
ah tukar mood ah
but then that means you won't have your feature wall macam rumah shah lah
because rumah shah is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then jalan wire kat belakang lah berlampu lah apa semua all the lights all the lights
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to tampal
let's say you want to move it depan tingkap
then the lights shines at the tingkap
we don't pasang first
tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can pasang what
ah so that one we nanti nanti dulu ah
tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu too fancy fancy you know what I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
I don't want macam blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
you want the house to look like one karaoke punya tempat ah
but it's but it's macam pening macam I don't want to come home to that kind of house
yes yes betul tapi we can do that tapi we play with shades we don't play with colour you tahu okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel ish macam atas atas hotel so you see atas atas hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and dorang punya furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all macam classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose macam ah simple ah structure metal
so it looks very macam nice and clean and comfortable tau and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
and then we can make it gradient that means atas light colour like the same green light colour light green lepastu pelan pelan medium lepastu pelan pelan dark green
if you want to buat macam a bit fancy
ah tapi gradient ada leceh sikit nak buat ah
that one tak salah you have to use sponge then macam
ah so leceh ah
so macam compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you nak paint gradient macam gitu so about the same tapi dapat paint satu bilik jer
and then you have to buy tiga cat
because you nak gradient kan you kena beli tiga tiga shades of cat ah
solid grey let's say grey ah solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of cat
let's say ah let's say you tak nak buat gradient
tahu lah I know
I'm just comparing the ni
berapa litre ah paling besar
lima litre ada lapan litre
yang bangladesh pakai kan
one big tub yang I pernah beli
oh ya cakap pasal brand
ah tadi I nampak satu advertisement and then uh apa tu
I don't know what technology dorang pakai
tak serious serious macam okay macam for example Nippon Paint cakap dia punya paint is odour-free
odourless and also ah kalau apa-apa conteng conteng you can wipe it off
tak I don't know but ya
I know tapi that's how they advertise ah so
they said that the paint purifies the paint purifies the air in your house then macam wah cool lah
tapi I rasa Nippon Paint should be okay lah enough lah Nippon Paint pun everyone use also okay lah
then the the one yang boleh lap ah kalau
err see if kita nak oil paint ataupun the
kan dua
kan ada dua dua type ya
got two types of paint satu is ah
cat minyak lagi satu is cat apa entah cat kapur ah cat kapur
tapi berkilat seh nanti
the finish is berkilat
is this one this one is kapur
ah oil-based is berkilat is like how ah
it's like okay sometimes you know void deck dia punya pillars tengah tengah dia macam ada pattern pattern then it's berkilat
kalau terkena baju ke terkena apa you buang
you buang sudah tu baju
bukan susah nak hilang tak boleh hilang pun jangan harap mm
ah tu ah
then awak masih nak yang
painting painting ayat tu
tak ah
I'm not saying I'm not saying that we gantung atas ah headboard kat katil
kat ni lah apa tu living room ke kat dining room area ke
if you want ayat-ayat then okay lah put lah but frame
no no you go you go to arab street got this one uh kedai dia punya ayat cara dia buat is so modern tau
cantik gila serious serious cantik gila
no but dia punya dorang macam buat three D printing punya tau of the of the tulisan
it's not old school rumah pakcik kind serious
it's not rumah rumah pakcik makcik punya
paste on wall looks like sekolah madrasah seh
you paste on the wall then macam dia macam mengotorkan
okay unless you can show me the kind of paste dekat wall that I am going to like
ya lah that's why I tell you I don't know which one I like because to me tak lawa
because you want to paste it besar besar dekat living room that one macam
apa uh you find me stickers ayat yang pada you cantik
no lah ayat from al-quran ah
ah kalau words of wisdom might as well I take the A B C english one atau malay one
so you find me a ayat
yang paste on yang pada you cantik yang you berkenan
you you pilih
bila masuk rumah kan ada satu tembok
oh tu tak boleh buat apa-apa eh tembok tu
tapi tu nanti nanti ah
sekarang jer store dia dah kecil
the the pakcik kecil kan store what actually the store is big what
mm the the dining table bulky seh like bulky gila punya kes makcik-makcik punya style
I don't want to put it inside a room ah then macam one whole pile kat tepi tu
kita nanti nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu because tu pun renovation seh
a'ah so still akan berabuk juga ah
it's just a fake wall and then a few macam ah apa tu
ah rak-rak
mmhmm a few rak-rak then okay already ah
and pintu okay lah oh ya ah I just realised rumah makcik tu tak ada bomb shelter
and then the our new house mana ada first floor
dia start from second floor what
mm boleh jer
but I think better if orang solat dekat inside the second bedroom ah because if they solat dekat the first bedroom then let's say we have our laptops
kita ada our documents
and then some more if I then some more if I bring in yang tu ah apa tu
exercise nya machine
ah there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to solat dekat the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
bilik amni looks kecil sebab katil dia besar
you got see before or not single bed then bawah dia boleh pull out
dengar lah dengar
awak punya idea of walk-in
kita ada this macam very short pathway kan actually short pathway tu tak ada
pasal makcik tu dia naik kan wadrobe tu nampak macam short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
macam this dua pintu so you tambah lagi satu pintu ah
and then tempat saya bersiap my
because my tempat siap is tengah tengah what so if I getting ready in the middle abeh you want to walk where got space
because your baju there what
actually kan saya tak suka bersiap duduk tau
I like to stand and siap
I thought it's with a chair and then macam
ah faham
just to taruk my barang barang makeup right
actually I don't want cermin
I don't like that kind of cermin I like this kind of cermin yang you can go up close
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm tengah bersolek
mm laci lah laci kecil
can ah then the laci I can put my tudung and then kat atas tu macam I buy the transparent plastic rak-rak then put lipstick lah ke apa semua
most most probably berselerak
dia tak selerak bila apa tau macam the first few days that I kemas
nanti dah after the first week terus dah macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ
orh side of the bed ya you sebelah tingkap ah
mm mm side side siapa panggil side side bed
mm tutup belum
because I was thinking if ada enough space eh if
couch kat kat kaki katil
you know okay when you go hotel hotel kadang-kadang dorang ada small couch kat depan katil
that's where you sit down drink kopi or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
kat wall lah
gantung kat ceiling a bit ugly you know
tak nak ah nanti jatuh kena kepala
orh rak eh
one simple rak
then after that kita taruk projector kat situ ah
ah then can taruk frames also
then macam it brightens up the room
it does dia macam you have so many memories then you can frame it up
cantik what
because it's very personalised so macam okay for example you go travelling and then you beli painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so macam it means something to you
maybe orang luar yang datang visiting tak tahu lah but you know what
because you are the owner of the house so you macam okay aku tahu aku beli painting ni dari mana and then uh okay this picture was me and you from where we go
because okay kebanyakkan orang kumpul this benda-benda sentimental lepastu they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
dia macam not very useful lah
eh don't want ah ugly ah tampal tampal tampal gitu
dah macam bilik budak
dah macam apa teenagers teenagers punya bilik
wow I'll be your age sekarang
tapi you dah empat puluh
imagine boleh imagine tak
awak dah empat puluh you'll be celebrating your four zero
hello and then bila you celebrate your four zero birthday birthday I belum sampai I masih tiga puluh tiga
as long as I dapat feature wall yang ada frame
syukur you know syukur
can kita dah cakap

benda yang kita kena siap kan dalam masa yang terdekat eh
seh dalam masa yang terdekat
bahas twenty twenty featuring nursalihati
okay kita kena beli barang-barang untuk bersihkan okay do you still want to hire people to sanitise the house
you want to find murah how murah kita five room tau sayang
five room you nak sanitise tu toilet lagi

how many men he want to use how many chemical how much chemical they want to use untuk sanitise the rumah
dia nak charge sama rumah
yes sayang kita five room
okay yes sayang kita five room tetapi kita five room bukan five room tau
kita nya five room besar tau sayang
then they want to cakap the price bopian ah dorang dah sampai pe

and that's like nanti we we buat apa ni
macam buat form konon eh aku kasi kau ah nadi you have to sign this form for making sure friends for life
so lagi satu tahun ah
banyak commitment
okay ah jom kita tengok
hmm macam
pada I semua makanan sedap so semua memorable
um kalau satu eh
terduduk right or like if I makan curry cause I tak suka sangat tau makan curry right so kalau makan curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the bunny chow ah macam mengidam
basically curry dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti
and then curry kat dalam
ya I know I cause like kita order kita nampak gambar tu that's why kita order kan
so tapi macam I think yang kenapa like
tempat the tempat itself
like orang-orang dia semua macam
chill right like dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
tempat orang tourist kan
terus tak ada orang then kita jer
food adventure day so macam
kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan was it a burger
cause also we had no money but kita nak makan banyak
ya nak kena agak-agak
agak-agak lah
oh aku ingat seh aku ingat McDonald's
I remember the McDonald's pasal
aku saja jer keluarkan chili packet um
I ada gambar I think
satu benda tu macam ah roti dalam dia daging
it's like roti prata dalam gulung gulung daging
kari daging or something like that is it
oh ada nasi
macam nasi briyani tapi tu tengah tengah dia cheese eh apa eh
cheese dengan daging ah
ah tu nasi
daging dengan cheese ke something lah putih there right it was a
ya then cause melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita ah cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
oh I aku tahu err there's something else kita cuba um apa benda tu yang roti
itu jer eh roti yang is also from the malay apa the melayu the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
so that no it wasn't bo-kaap it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular roti
what was the roti called
okay so the roti is like ah roti perancis panjang gitu kan and then after that dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam you nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam
ya but it's like a very very long roti perancis right
sayur right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole roti perancis and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
ah terus kita nak masuk kan ice box pun tak berani
tu lepas tu tak ada microwave
so kita macam
nak buat apa ni eh so I remember satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak
uh it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that roti perancis betul tak
and then the next then the next roti perancis
front that roti we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
no it's ya sedap
then the other day I tengok then there's I think someone was also at
the freaking roti perancis
um was we wanted to go to the hill remember kita there was like
hari kedua kan kita dah sampai okay so we sampai kat cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so kita lah macam ghairah kan konon banyak tenaga so kita orang macam okay the next day ya
masih muda that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged kita nak pergi we know tak nak buang masa kita nak terus like jump into all the activities right
so kita pergi
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we lepas just after we got off and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was kita nak panjat itu hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so kita macam okay ah boleh ah settle juga ah kan so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name ah I remember it was something very doug
betul it's like no doug or something doug lah his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb nak tengok sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people panjat kat situ they start kat situ then they panjat and then by the time dorang kat atas nampak sunrise so kita macam eh it doesn't look like
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so kita okay lah go jer so so kita tak tak pakai benda climbing pun kita pakai jeans kan kita pakai winter coat uh you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
tak bersedia langsung we just started and then air pun tak ada I remember
botol air kita ada satu jer botol air right between us there's satu botol air
kasut biasa and then kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula
you know Daim kan yang chocolate gula-gula something like that
I think there's like berapa gula-gula jer and then after that ya satu botol air okay so we started climbing then masih boleh sempat vlog tau mana video tu pun aku tak tahu pergi
then kita panjat
kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik eh belum lagi sampai a'ah so kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay ah
ah puncak dia macam jauh kan
I don't know lah kita dah sampai
go jer ah ikut jer takkan nak stop
a'ah eh tak jauh ah
terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat kan terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk kan then ada bench
then it was like facing the apa the town below so kita macam wah cantik kita pun duduk then kita duduk then kita macam penat terus minum air ah then kita minum air wah macam relax ah konon terus minum air
then by that time also sunrise pun dah naik terus kan kita macam okay don't need see sunrise ah but never mind ah
ya and then I remember kita share gula-gula
apa ni minum air lepas tu dah okay dah nak can continue okay jom continue lagi
continue berapa jam ah dua jam tiga jam dua jam
aku rasa dua jam continue all the way to the top
like seriously siapa panjat all the way tak perasan macam oh go jer
like macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung
tak like waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat kan then the angin
naik kan
ah macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik so I think that's why kita macam every time kita pass by that part kita macam cepat-cepat naik kan macam go go go go
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the kepala and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so kita
but the Grab driver didn't see that kita tak pakai baju athletic at all oh okay kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus
oh I remember after when we were going down kan aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak so dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini
dengan beg sekolah dengan coat warna biru aku ingat seh coat aku biru macam shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so macam I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
ya macam
tak puas kan
we all melayu together
you talk all the masjid-masjid
all the masjid
kita ikut macam ada walking tour kan tapi tu kita tak halfway kita macam
kira was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
the safari so we had so basically lepas kita dah
ya it felt so long right ya like hari-hari ada benda nak buat
weekend kita orang pergi mana
pergi entah lah sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the budak-budak yang ada were budak apa american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans tak complain sangat confirm dorang complain ya
ya so for that after kita dah belajar for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so kita orang pergi um basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then kita ya basically went and look at all
we saw we saw them but like kat reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
oh there was more than three right four I think empat
sepuluh kot and then macam aku tahu we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause tak ada orang like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya same tanah air
um ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they dorang taruk nama dorang in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
and then err at the end of the whole thing we realised yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih mature I would say eh and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other lah sebelum tu when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van yang first first tu semua macam
nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa tau macam at first dorang start off macam ghairah nak mampus macam woo woo woo tapi tu at the end of the
like the whole week dorang macam
macam enemies eh macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk van kita
beginning macam
tak kesah all then at the end of the whole thing kita orang macam woo woo woo
berapa one week plus
I remember when kita dah balik he still message me for photo
I'm like ya like okay hantar hantar hantar hantar
so what what did we do kita buat oh we did bungee jumping
oh dia tolak
ya I was like siapa eh I think kaysa eh anyway I was just telling her like
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just raba raba
so instead instead of the muka-muka kawan it's basically
do you want to talk about the food atau makanan atau everyday activity
aku baru nak tanya what's stopping you
no the question was three but never mind I don't tengok we take turns ah
I mean dulu aku pernah
primary school pernah belajar apa inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I feel like I pernah tanya kaysa
ya you know hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat kallang punya eh ice skating sama-sama and then dorang complain budak-budak tu kacau
similar like if you can naik if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
right and then if you you know especially why kau tengok kau tengok movie movie kan dorang tengok ah macam pretty women yang baru punya tu eh pretty women pula little women kan
and then they there was a scene where joe and laurie pergi kat lake and then after that they skate
tak hitam ke tak merah tak sunburn
banana boat ke
you tak tahu swim you tak nak mati
it's not it's not like the tarik you that kind
tak ada lah
oh ah memang a'ah
okay tapi tu kalau I if you tahu macam mana nak float kan aku rasa okay jer
kalau macam gitu then okay lah bye bye
asal kan kau tak mati okay jer macam floating is the kau tak mati
jangan apa ni jangan dapat cramps sudah
ah hujan ah
a'ah hujan ah
cable car dari bawah naik
oh as opposed to dua hari
it's either they brought the stones up atau dorang carve dari mountain
uh huh uh huh selalunya dorang carve kan dari mountain
oh I thought I thought macam dorang tak tahan lepas tu tolong terlalu banyak tension cabut
sana memang orang punya license pun
okay okay I mean aku faham dia tinggal kat negara singapura dah lama juga you know what I mean
huh suara lain sikit
tak payah nak try
so sabar so dia that means dia stop ah terus dia cabut as in
or memang plan dia memang until that time aje
kalau kita kita nak kena fikir lama-lama nak kena hmm
and then eventually we masih bodoh cakap jom boleh

sedap I don't think
ten dollar something tak itu
itu kan itu K gambar dia letak wing and stick kan so literally the drumstick and the chicken wing attach together tau lepas tu bila I buka kotak it's literally just two wing
ah tapi dalam gambar tu ada empat
drumstick dengan chicken wing attach together
yang Z Z macam Z shape tu
ah four of that so macam worth it lah so we bought that two meal
habis um
ya dan
banyak ah
tapi I think the sekarang the chicken yang
macam kalau you crave for chicken I will go for ginger chicken
cause the cause dia orang ada that promotion tau apa twelve piece at nine ninety
oh dia orang punya six piece is seven dollar something
apa twelve piece
is fourteen dollar something lepas tu
lepas tu macam selalu ada that promotion ada nine twelve piece for nine dollar so I was always I will always get that
itu kalau macam homemade ah

uh abang abang still
ah ah acik say she got he will stay for another month and then wait for another
for review of that one month and see how if he gonna stay in or he can keluar
then ayah macam mati-mati nak buat bilik dia dekat living room
lepas tu I am like are you sure like kak aiman say ah are you sure like the body or nanti dia melekat macam dekat bilik dia kan even though dia seorang
ya tapi nak ke bawah dia satu rumah
ya like ayah
oh tapi
but ambin tu tak buang-buang
I perasan dua-dua our parents macam asal boleh jer like they want lah but then
asal boleh jer
kan ah dari last two years eh last three years ah nak pecahkan ambin habis sekarang tak pecahkan wah oh my god lepas tu bila hari itu asri buat like they denting the house right
I macam then I feel macam at least buat something ah dengan rumah tu really have to go ah cause
ambin tak ada ambin macam err special feature for our house if like visitors guest datang but then it's also a burden to us
ya macam dulu okay
ya and then ayah pun tak ada kena carpet pe might as well just remove everything lah
effort have to put in like the kayu have to go through the window
nasib baik tinggal tingkat dua seh
at least do sophisticated sikit
zen ya tapi tak kisah sangat ambin kalau baring sebab nanti macam you can feel the
cause dia orang punya like square feet all memang macam about the around the same ah macam kecil-kecil
ini pun buka habis terus jamban like
if you kalau kalau the the window the door will be macam to a bit wider one kan dah langgar dah jamban tu
rectangular jamban
to be uh huh habis tu dia orang punya bracket bracket semua ni kat luar like wiring wiring terjojol macam dulu ke semua kat dalam kan

err tak cukup lagi ida ida tak cukup
okay akak ada satu lagi top achievement akak
akak first time bayar zakat pendapatan
that one is the first one akak bayar zakat pendapatan alhamdulillah
okay okay okay ida ada lagi
what were the top five painful lesson that you learnt allah
okay akak dulu
staff yang kita orang baru ambil bekerja selama sebulan berhenti
okay dia cakap ya lah sebab macam kita orang tak dapat pindah then kalau pindah macam mana business dekat sini and so on kan so macam dia
ya lah mempertikaikan mengapa perempuan tak boleh ke buat business kan ha ah macam tu a'ah I don't know we don't know
the first one the second one ada juga staff yang berhenti
that is under our ini lah macam kita sponsor
satu team um e-sports
dia tak lah directly tapi that
because the person yang err handle yang team e-sport itu adalah among our business partners
yang our staff yang bukan lah our staff macam his staff yang berhenti itu kan
memang macam rude lah bahasa yang dia gunakan sangat rude
dia itu macam ini tak err bukan competence tak competence lah dia kata tak bagus lah apa semua memang rude
memang rude kalau baca message dia memang rude
a'ah itu ah macam kan kan sudah tak pernah kerja tempat lain tapi
tak apa lah okay so that one is second
ingat tak waktu bulan tiga apa yang berlaku we need to refund
fifteen K to uh our clients lah because waktu itu ah
project tak dapat jalan and COVID comes and then
actually dia orang nak minta kita bayar dua puluh ribu ah
tapi err we said to them yang kita kan sudah buat kerja sikit so kenapa nak refund full
so dia orang minta refund lima belas ribu then
that one is very tough lah untuk kita semua for her for us as a team and
for others lah juga untuk dia juga lah
and that one is better for her juga lah sebenarnya okay
okay so empat saja boleh tak
terlalu painful lah okay ida tak nak cakap tak nak cerita lima okay
waktu dia susah bukannya waktu kita susah lah okay
balik lah
mm mm cakap saja lah terus terang
okay yang awak rasa macam top lima yang memang awak rasa awak buat keputusan yang betul yang awak betul lah
ya sama
walaupun kita duduk seorang tapi rasanya macam yup yup tapi tak lah memikirkan masalah di rumah
okay that one is the first one sama dengan akak juga second one
okay alright teruskan teruskan
tempat asal lah tempat awak tinggal awak dapat tawaran dekat tempat asal awak lahir okay then
stay tempat yang ada sekarang tempat yang awak belajar lah
err saat rasa macam ada certain soalan macam a bit repeat lah
okay let's say sudah tak ada
apa ah top five things yang you got right is the first one is I made a
bukan lah ada bukan lah make decision pun I terpaksa pun untuk hantar thesis I supaya I dapat viva
nak kena mengasuh dia orang bagi faham lah apa benda lah lepas itu tak faham-faham juga
but then ada staff yang we got it right yang bagus
walaupun macam yang mungkin macam gaji yang kita bagi pun tak ini tapi we promise to her that we might be give you
better later because kita pun tak kaya kan
so kita tak nak lah share kekayaan itu di kalangan kita saja kita mesti nak share dengan orang lain juga
okay so I'm not sure it is the got right ke tak tapi
ah mempertimbangkan lah okay entah lah ada berapa sudah empat kan empat saja lah okay next question
okay akak dulu ah okay risiko terbesar yang akak ambil adalah
macam to from kelas mengaji err class mengaji physical to online fully
and memang struggle ya allah ya rabbi buat facebook live and so on macam gitu kan
tapi we managed to do that lah walaupun struggle
totally memang change and then after that we build um err jauhari
masih dalam progress and hero cilik waktu itu and like then juga shine untuk board game lah
tak ada okay we skip all that question then soalan keenam
what was the smartest decision you made dekat sama kan
okay tak payah lah okay next which three important relationship improved the most family tadi awak cakap lagi
alright okay dua okay so macam akak pun akak the first one is
err ya lah our relationship eh kita tak ada siapa-siapa kita dua orang saja ida okay with my room mate dengan ida
akak rasa akak better sikit dengan ayah akak kot
selama ini akak ada perception yang macam
anggap tak baik apa semua kan tapi bila akak macam bantu dia untuk kerja sekejap
kak kak nampak lah dia usaha dan dia struggle
kak relationship dengan itu lah ah okay okay
ah that guy okay cuma
ya lah macam dulu kan akak ini macam lelaki ini apa teruk ah apa semua kan but right now okay just be understanding lah okay nombor sembilan
dia beri greatest impact dekat ida lah
okay aduh sebab
ya lah sebab tahun ini kan kita jarang masa bersama dia kau orang okay untuk akak
err ada dua lah dua close friend okay err
bukan lah someone yang yang bersama-sama dengan kami sudah dalam business partner
tapi dia tetap seorang sahabat yang ada kadang-kadang sometime bila kita macam
contact dia minta nasihat ke apa ke walaupun saya memang marah lah dekat dia tetap lah orang yang beri impact kepada saya lah okay
first one jadi seorang yang lebih baik atau seorang yang pemarah ada dua kan the second one um
okay second one yang memang sentiasa kalau misal kata okay dia kalau dia ada masalah dia akan call
dia akan call akak tapi dia pun sedia untuk mendengar apa masalah kita
okay then last year is the first one yang akak cerita dengan dia after few years lah sudah berkawan kan
baru lah akak reveal dekat dia siapa yang bagi teratai akak rasa tahun lepas ya that one
akak reveal ah sedangkan orang bagi sudah teratai sejak tahun dua ribu sebelas
ah sudah sembilan tahun sudah waktu itu kawan err apa
yang kawan akak yang sudah ini kan yang sudah yang sudah pindah balik itu
err akak tanya okay okay memandangkan awak sudah tak ada kan okay ada satu benda yang ini nak bagi tahu okay so bagi tahu lah yang akak yang bagi teratai itu okay
um my parents err no I mean not err err macam
err macam sometime not in a good side but somehow
it turns to be a bad side juga okay uh so
greatest impact sebab greatest impact tak tahu apa benda ah okay soalan nombor sepuluh ida
okay ramai itu okay
ya lah family lah kan family mak ayah adik itu saja lah
third spend time the most ini boleh jadi orang yang kita call
yang paling nak akak cakap dengan top first
asnah lah itu tak dapat dinafikan itu memang top first lah
sudah okay next how did those five people influence you wow ambil engkau
yes so dia banyak bagi nasihat and so on lah
okay bagus bagus so itu lah yang paling most impact lah
okay so akak err
influence yang the first one is asnah
dia yang suggest sudah lama sudah dia memang suggest untuk akak pergi jumpa psychiatric
instead of counsellor ah sebab dia tak dia rasa it's not ini lah kan
and then after yang um
akak punya akak go talk dengan doctor doctor itu kan yang akak cakap dengan awak itu
and then after that akak decide memang akak tak nak go for university punya
akak go for memang professional punya field lah
and then um apa macam mana dia apa ini how impactful these five people ini
um tadi parents akak dan juga akak cakap pasal madrasah kan okay so madrasah yang akak pergi ini um
dia orang err most of them are refugees
okay and there is uh ada satu macam episode lah yang mana seorang budak ini dia
ganggu tau lembu dekat kawasan itu
orang kampung lah kata dia nampak okay but then um and then
macam pihak penguasaan madrasah ini macam marah lah and tampar budak itu depan mata akak
so itu akak rasa macam sudah lah you sudah lah dia refugees tahu dia memang
macam itu lah kan macam memang ya lah kita tak tahu negara dia dulu macam mana kan
memang ya lah mungkin dia orang bermasalah tapi dia dia orang adalah kanak-kanak yang ada perasaan
okay so issue nya adalah budak itu duduk tonggeng-tonggeng
punggung dekat orang kampung lah apa semua lepas itu main lepas itu macam
lepas itu err I talk to my dad lah waktu itu kan macam mm
anak ah cucu dia buat benda yang sama tak sama saja so apa
apa beza cucu dengan orang yang dia jaga ini ini kan
sama saja dia orang pun budak juga even err ya lah memang cucu lah umur bawah kecil sikit kan tapi sama saja
uh these refugees kulit hitam ke kenapa kita tak respect dia
okay so that one like yang I rasa err macam lagi kasihan dekat budak-budak semua ini so
these people ini yang give greatest impact to me lah okay soalan nombor sepuluh
who are the five people you spend the bukan ah sudah sudah salah salah nombor dua belas nombor dua belas what were the best five books you read
tapi dia tak ada cakap dua puluh dua puluh tahu dia bagi tahu what were the best five books you read itu saja
err daun tidak membenci angin macam itu ah
dia pasal cerita saja macam itu ah and
buku itu daripada bukan daripada ini lah dia memang negara luar punya
apa uh daun tidak membenci angin macam itu tajuk dia kalau tak silap ah ah okay
buat cerita apa ini dengan activity dengan budak-budak macam itu lah tapi
and ada satu masa itu ah dia punya quote dia macam ini ah
okay kita banyak menyalahkan takdir tapi semua yang jadi ini semua tuhan sudah tahu
even macam daun yang jatuh pun allah atas kan sudah allah kan ah
so benda itu just go with the flow jer okay so the first book
okay ida ada lagi tak buku sambil-sambil tu kita tukar-tukar lah
buku english
okay nanti aku nak baca
oh okay dia orang tak kahwin
okay walaupun dia sudah tak ada
okay okay akak ada satu lagi err buku yang akak rasa macam ini
ah sepanjang COVID err kak asnah suggest untuk akak baca lah who moved my cheese
ah that one ah dia macam okay
err dia orang dia ada beberapa ini lah beberapa character mm
tikus lah yang mana yang stay
sampai lah cheese itu habis
maksudnya tapi sebelum cheese itu habis lagipun um waktu cheese itu ada dia orang sampai sudah buat rumah apa semua dekat situ
which is these people adalah orang yang cepat settle down
tapi bila cheese sudah habis macam mana kan tempat sudah dekat situ apa semua so macam itu lah
and another one adalah orang yang nampak orang yang tahu cheese ini akan habis
so dia get ready with another another option okay
and daripada dua ekor ini juga dia orang ada yang berpecah satu lagi memang nak stay
berharap yang orang akan hantar lagi cheese dekat situ
cari cheese tapi tak jumpa struggle jatuh terduduk macam nak mati nak macam semua lah
tapi akhirnya dia jumpa cheese
uh tapi tapi after that the fasa yang sangat sangat teruk lah okay
ah itu lah who moved my cheese lah okay lagi ada buku lagi tak baru dua
ah then another one is err buku karangan liyana musfira ini err
dia macam untuk buku untuk wanita-wanita lah yang mana yang orang rasa orang cakap ah sudah tua tak kahwin lagi
ah sudah kahwin tak ada anak err sudah kahwin satu anak nak dua
lepas itu orang yang memang pilih untuk business dan sebagainya dan semuanya silap
a'ah kan tak ada benda yang betul pun tapi asyik dipertikaikan so macam mana kita nak
err apa bangun daripada scars pun dia bagi tahu okay
ada ada fasa yang macam bila akak seorang then ah then a lot of things kan
this world doesn't deserve me ah macam itu ah so
this is the first lah yang I I'm grateful for is I am still alive

so that this um apa ini
kita punya resolution untuk eh resolution
atas view of orchard tapi err in a budget hotel
I mean okay lah I mean considering dia punya apa tu space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite macam convenient and comfortable because macam very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because macam like you have to walk through the lorong and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that lah so macam I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like ah okay
I hate it oh my god macam like betul betul self-conscious sia oh my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare kalau like terglare and then you like oh no
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we datang selalu kan so
ya then you have to wait lah queue then wait for the aunty to like okay adik berapa orang okay dua orang duduk okay ah
adik also it's not abang okay it's adik cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know lah but he look I call him adik cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him ah adik nasi ayam dua I tell you it'll be so insulting
we'll be like adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with uh female punya shopkeeper yang macam fierce and garang right
nak apa dik nak apa huh makan lah dik semua tak nak
ya so macam like oh okay lah maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza sahaja so I think because you see eh the near nenek atau mak tak tahu lah dia punya atuk ke apa they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause dorang tahu macam orh ah nak pakcik ni cute ah macam like dia selalu smiling
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially kalau queue makanan kau sampai of course you want to cepat-cepat kasi habis pe
you mean angkat ayam merah oh ya
oh yang kat tepi err
mm I mean macam like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that tapi ah ya his diabetic punya reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends ah I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
he did this one going on for a couple of years what it's just that macam he only started yang exercise is much more rigorous because err he goes I mean he eventually found like kaki to you know run and all there and then you know lah people kat sana dorang selalu macam nak
buat apa tu compete siapa lari lagi banyak and all that ya
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby orang macam like oh they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends lah so it's always good to always
uh check whether you punya you know levels okay ke tak
it's very frustrating ah macam like especially for my brother-in-law cause dia dah yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so boleh naik pangkat
ya exactly but because doctor kata dia ada this certain levels you know that kind of thing so dia tak boleh ambil ah ya so he needs to be macam semua okay so that he can resume taking then lepas tu baru dia boleh considered for uh promotion
mm I mean like you will be wondering lah so I remember macam like on sangat kuruskan badan lah and all that because ya he's stuck there because like macam they said that oh because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted macam tu ah
not ya this is going to be a long period lah mana boleh overnight turn kau ni pun
so ya so um I mean I was telling lah maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I nak turunkan my eh my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
tak lah dia pergi doctor just untuk check dia punya apa tu blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with macam like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that main pun gila so aku marah dengan kakak
but just tauge because err okay
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like macam you want to be healthy then okay lor unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that tapi setakat macam nak like show off then ugh
I like apa tu make your own plans lah as
no more like my father is atas not us we're not there yet
apanya yang birch car punya skirt
oh okay okay uh yang baju lengan pendek tu ah okay okay
but now it's available kau tak nak beli
beli satu jer
mm mm it's really about whether or not um you nak better details but you need to take care of the material ataupun
and specifically macam like you do not have menses on that day
four or five pieces of clothing on depends ah sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait macam cause I beli tengah mid year sale atau end year sale
and then I will purposely go bila err towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many err options for me so I just make do with what's available lah
you know like okay lah boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana which explains my poor choices of clothing lately lah it's really makcik makcik bodoh but then
ada ada yang teruk lah aku macam terjujur juga
mm mm no but you must also always set aside something lah like for your self-care and all that tapi it's just with self-care fund that you dah set aside you have to really properly choose your battle lah macam like I nak pergi let's say lah pedi mani mani pedi ke lagi massage ke you know
um hair treatment ke so it's really macam you have to choose one of those macam ya
macam staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya tak boleh macam like I nak pergi staycay then lepas tu I nak buat kuku I I nak buat rambut I no no such thing ya
maintain lah bengok
no it's really about macam the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so technically kalau macam begitu
kalau macam begitu lah it really depends actually ya um you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya murah tak kesah asalkan okay lah you guna kan
kat ion yes
I mean if don't have also you can always pergi dengan
dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena inject kat uh spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
then itu lah naik Grab mm
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just uh call the hospital just to inform and then after that err tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting lah than daripada keep quiet call kena towed away you know we don't want that to happen
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there bodoh sia
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time eh motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak
mm mm so ya lah nak kena kena actually call or inform at least just to check
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before tapi
no never because I think because of location macam
ya so far so tak tak hairan lah
ya lah that was even later you know that was in october ya so the paling recent pun
ya can you imagine oh my god letak the kids at home I need to get them out
no lah because you have to book in cause you just you just got the vouchers right so you can only book macam only now lah recently sebelum ni tak boleh book in advance
ya ya ya staycay is that one lah that one is a given itu ada book err quite early
tapi macam like
ya lah new year pun expensive lah mana mana expensive seh cause nak step tengok fireworks ah and all that
can you imagine you stay here then kau nampak kat hujung there's fireworks okay ah
eh but if you have new year's eve kat sini then you look out quite nice eh
oh okay okay tahu tahu a'ah tahu tahu okay okay
mahal gila mahal gila I mean dia macam chalet eh ke apa ni
resort lah macam itu
ee boring nya
now just lebih mahal sia
nak beratur still mahal satu malam
ya but at least kau turun pun banyak barang kau boleh buat apa
I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain kat sana tengok momok
ya the thing is kadang kala how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean kalau nak kata kan pulau ubin okay lah eh but you you don't need a passport for that tapi I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon ah maybe like macam pertengahan twenty twenty one
I entah lah aku mana tahu
they delayed because err tiba-tiba ada the spike in the number of cases ah
and sketchy sekarang
I think macam I think kat thailand macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk would be macam kat um malaysia
because I think number of cases so far yang dorang report kat news thailand macam tak ada jer
mean ada yang tempat rural ke
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right bodoh
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay lah kasut kau orang lah I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any err medical attention if they ever get COVID
all over the country oh bagus lah good job
mm mm mm mm tengok jer lah
how sure are you there are the same group of people mungkin tak lah ada tapi segelintir
daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni then you like ah korang minta kena sepak
ya you know that time dekat asia one kan tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam train tak pakai mask bodoh betul
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador atau the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like kadang-kadang orang singapore ini kan dorang banyak complain banyak ambil gambar banyak submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
ada lah segelintir
no dia kena saman lazarus island pun sama semua kena saman
I feel like you kalau jail yang perempuan yang kata mana tak
ya that one she does it she did it repeatedly kalau you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time tak serik second time tak serik
ya lah but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone lah like got the first time okay kalau kau buat lagi then that's it kau minta kena sepak you know that kind of thing
apa dia we have what
no the thing is adela they have different arrangement adela so macam like offices right now right they said ah cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that macam
kan begini ah seh
khatib khatib kat mana ni
oh kat yishun itu
oh yang ah ya ya I wanted to ask him mana then I I saw HomeTeam
panjat panjat panjat then lepas tu
but ada lah I've been avoiding arrows so much
alah kesian
maybe should just put disclaimer I'm really nice please don't take my niceness wrongly you know macam cerita a walk to remember please don't fall in love with me
oh ya that's true dorang just bengat gila sia
yes ke bedek ah you know like ah
aww awak ambil berat tentang saya ke oh alah comelnya naik nombor boleh ah pergi mampus lah
ku baik salah ku tak baik salah semua adiknya pergi mampus lah
I think no lah maybe just because like I don't know maybe dorang main game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to macam vent you know dekat rumah you know that kind of thing
okay jer lah aku dah biasa benda begini
like ya like I even have my favourite buaya at uh
no lah because you know kat malaysia kan ada satu video ni the mum ke the father ask the the child bunyi ayam macam mana bunyi kucing macam mana bunyi itik macam mana
I tak tahu and then bunyi buaya macam mana the bunyi buaya is hi sayang
ya so what I mean my favourite buaya is I have this one player who always use the same line on me every single time we play
so I was like eh buaya favourite I and then he's like hi sayang still bisik-bisik nak tidur kan ah macam mana you tahu
I'll be like pergi mampus boleh ya
uh ya usually do that in the presence of other guys then they'll be like kau yang buaya lah sia
tak tahu lah aku malas layan tu kalau dorang mengamuk tu antara bini dengan dia bukan aku nya pasal
alah kesian
kan you main game lah belajar lah main game
I mean nak kena ada schedule lah like okay my previous clan right err
they they are they are they are all muslim married and they have children and all that so what they do is uh they they actually actually agreed with their wife tahu macam okay I will settle everything I will take care of the kids you know homework and all that but then I will play I will have my playing time from nine thirty onwards
is is is is surprising because you know why pasal mereka berbual dalam telephone kan eh dalam game okay abang dah habis ngaji bang okay sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur eh
adik adik macam mana adik homework dah habis ke dik okay kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah check nanti adik boleh tidur
so it's normal lah I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know err really manage time and all that tapi ada tak tahu lah yang macam bengap semacam
I mean like there are a few macam like shirk responsibility sanggup balik rumah lambat and all that pasal nak main game kat luar
tak tahu mana aku tahu but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought dia belum kahwin tahu because uh my that time my friend was like kau dekat rumah bujang uh uh then I was like rumah bujang then after that I ask my friend then I said rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck tapi dorang mana rumah flat kat situ kan so is macam like those
pondok-pondok like kosong like people rest
mm mm macam itu lah along the road ada satu err so that's what they call rumah bujang lah
tak tak tepi road lah tapi ah correct ya ya correct ah ah ah lah sial
then aku aku macam cause nanti dia macam like okay aku nak balik
eh kat mana ni sekarang
eh lawa kat rumah bujang ni then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group ah the lobby right
dia tanya kau orang eh
uh rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya you know macam like macam like okay rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke and then he's like tak tahu lah you tanya dia sendiri
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person lah I said asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri err dia kata kat rumah dia punya internet tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ
fair enough because like macam awak that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the hutan
ya so I'm like okay lah fair enough lah desak kau kau buat apa kau nak
ya lah data pun tak boleh
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research tak bagus data pun tak bagus
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's kat itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite macam low to medium right depending ah
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos lah lepas alah
kan macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil
ya ya I do that tapi nak kena ada portable charger lah or maybe mm mm mm
tapi kalau macam like err either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
mm mm betul betul
it's literally macam cucuk selah
apa pasal aku berdarah sia kat bawah
like I feel like I fell like macam I be right again
so macam lepas tu aku pergi toilet kan I kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah I was like
takut bilang kau that time
akunya akunya benda baik balik bodoh
is because it's really macam masuk then dia pakai macam clamp sakit bodoh
kau belum kena lagi kan berbual banyak huh
they do put the benda macam gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that cuma like the initial part a bit painful lah
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the cepat and you get the result on the spot also
ah kalau ada fibroid ke tak so buat buat sekali lah and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like macam like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like begini sudah beranak dua no I said no I said I said dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising and then when I kena
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya then she's like baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan
ada ambil ah
eh but then when I was at the clinic ini kan it's so awkward
because semua orang datang dengan dorang punya partner I went there alone
tak tahu apa nak buat kesian like husband pandai buat you know that kind of thing
bila nak penetrate semua nak ya bodohnya jantan
ya depan belakang tak boleh okay pusat pun boleh
ya air air I also quite a number of people lah you know people in who had late pregnancies then I see teenagers with their mum it's so it's quite sad actually
like I pretend macam dengar music daripada hal
tak nampak pregnant ah tapi dia macam nangis lah but I wanted to tell the mum like you're doing a great job ya
unless ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia lah
mmhmm lepas beranak ah mm mm
macam like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not aduh what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about macam how to have sex responsibly or safely
pakai tu lah saran wrap
ya because err err kadang-kadang you know before when they did that ligation right maybe an egg has already been released
is it yang is it yang reflect journal is it the journal yang
a'ah I can hear you snoring from the hall itu lah it reminds me macam aku punya poly days whenever aku tengok muka kau penat kan like macam it reminds me of my poly
that's why kau akan nampak aku selalu satu malam jer dekat rumah tak buat apa-apa actually aku duduk dalam bilik fikir fikir-fikir benda but then
kau pun nampak ah at end of the day bila aku macam submission aku macam oh chill and happy and everything sebab tak fikir banyak then when is the start the semester start balik lah all the stress and all the macam eh don't disturb me now don't talk to me don't don't whatever don't
eh but kalau aku boleh pull through aku lagi design background I don't have any design background kita madrasah we don't have any art school tak ada D&T art and craft I cannot draw a straight line ke apa-apa but then
okay I cannot draw a circle straight line boleh with a ruler but then still aku manage to pull through ah so macam aku selalu tengok
kau stress kan aku fikir macam ah lah you are left with err one and a half more years you are already in two point two ah so are you excited for three point one chey
huh but you are in a school what kau kat polytechnic semua benda kau task to do you complete what
eh that actually happen to me bila poly uh apa ni bila during internship whereby aku punya internship kan aku design web design dengan digital pin
abeh time tu aku punya task untuk buat it was already aku punya internship was just three months long sebab kita punya panjang abeh
during aku eh three to four months internship so during macam like the first one third of the internship I had to design something for an overseas museum
so aku nak kena design macam dorang punya apa ni interactive punya benda and it's not even a topic that is being touched on dekat poly tak ada pun imagine kau kena buat punya benda
kira macam code tapi untuk punya system orang letak I pad dorang boleh scan abeh kita orang nak kena design that code
and actually at the start of the project it was only me and I had to design for four building pasal museum dia ada four buildings then I had to design all four outer thing so that when visitor datang dorang boleh scan benda tu initially aku kena buat sorang-sorang
then kau internship sama-sama dengan kawan lah ask your friend to internship like sama-sama company like apply together
mana tahu like macam kalau tak kan my company tiga orang apply three people apply me and apa ni kawan aku yang lelaki yang end up dengan sama-sama internship and another aku punya close friend but in the end dorang reject my close friend sebab ada dua intern kat company tu and dorang can only like
hire two interns at that point of time and is a good thing dia ada sebab dia more vocal than aku so macam because
I think it's because it's an environment whereby I'm not comfortable with it's an environment aku tak comfortable jadi macam
aku take a very long time to berbual even dengan aku punya supervisor but luckily but the thing is during aku punya internship kan is not the supervisor my supervisor dia macam assign assign benda jer dia cuma assign aku for one task which is to
it's a mural wall for a company yang dia dah buat cuma bila dia send dekat client client nak kena revise so aku yang revise that file which in the end bila aku submit balik sebelum aku habis internship aku punya supervisor kata aku buat salah abeh by then client dah accept aku punya design so macam hmm pandai-pandai lah kau kau betulkan aku punya file tapi client dah macam eh okay macam gitu tapi during aku punya internship was
aku punya kira macam senior one of kita orang punya senior dia macam higher sikit dari supervisor punya position dia yang apa ni uh overlook aku dengan ni pasal aku ada tiga project afterwards kan so this tiga project was overlook macam dia oversee kita punya design work bukan aku punya supervisor
cuma dia pasal aku punya mural wall
tapi client dah accept so macam aku nak pergi balik tempat tu abeh tengok mural wall tu pasal it's for pasal dorang sewa tempat this company punya one of the room so mural wall dia ada dekat company itu so macam kalau aku tebalkan muka maybe boleh datang tengok tapi jangan pergi atas lah
huh macam mana
dia punya company dia buat apa as in what is the
research pasal
ah but then dia punya nature of the work tak perlukan dia to be in office lain macam like certain
courses ataupun kerja yang macam there was one guy the same area as aku punya internship pasal aku punya office based kan dia punya another group of friend from different course tapi kita orang punya course related to mass communication eh dorang bukan mass comm dorang communication design aku punya interactive media design so dorang punya is like dekat
macam printing factory tau so aku tak tahu whether kalau during that time lah if is like during period
abeh kalau kau macam magazine ke newspaper ke cetak buku sekolah ke
abeh siapa nak jaga machine kat sana
wah rabak seh can't imagine myself if during imagine you
kau ada kawan year one kan
ah lagi especially kita madrasah student kan jadi kita tak pernah exposed to like apa ni people from different races
different ya ke like macam all this while korang berbual kat sekolah berbual melayu jer pe
ah okay lah like during my time is like total culture shock aku kena joget semua
wah like looking back right macam haram sia aku buat semua
ah kau tak regret
ya I remember ya you had a apa ni project during secondary school I scolded you for like macam huh benda macam gini simple pun tak boleh buat ya that is so
pathetic pun ada
actually honestly kan like since aku first kan among kita punya siblings kan so macam aku tak ada kakak or abang to ask things from mummy and is like totally apa ni dorang tak tahu apa-apa and they depend on me kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik shahrul macam mana nak anuh ni semua kan dulu bila aku start pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku can imagine last time before kita ada internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend yang pandai internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours pakai dia punya internet computer remember so aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya email dorang tolong buatkan aku punya friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad tak akan aku nak tunjuk and you like what kindergarten lagi pe time tu like time tu I was
okay kau baru primary kan
no it was like primary four primary six ya lah ya so primary four primary six yang kita jalan gi apa ni bedok library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime nak pergi mana then I say or else mummy tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi library so last time kalau nak buat research ke apa pergi library ah abeh tu then bila abi beli computer letak dekat bilik that's when slowly but then kita pakai internet untuk buat apa tengok youtube video game
ya so dulu pun macam struggle pun struggle sendiri juga like macam ah yes and that's the ni apa ni
aku by the time kan boleh nampak beza tau so time tu aku ingat masa aku tuition ah aku tuition dengan kak mon kak mon sama umur kan cuma aku first child dia third
so bila kita kat tuition I never felt the difference between me and mon so aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama like we learn together we grew up together like we had silat and everything like that and like on these last few days of the kita orang punya tuition ni the kakak cakap
ah mar anak nombor berapa then I say first then mun berapa oh patut lah nampak beza then I was like huh there is a difference macam dia kata in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her macam aku merepek-merepek pun there is still a difference between
tu lah so last time aku struggle ah kau nampak aku macam I had it all like some uh macam senang but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like macam mana nak pakai computer macam mana nak buat ni nak buat report macam mana nak buat homework okay of course I had tuitions lah back then but
dapat laptop
itu lah susah kan dulu hidup
and tak macam dulu
macam kau sekarang by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would macam huh benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu
but then kau imagine kau and last time it was not as apa ni is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation tau so macam memang kena belajar and last time I honestly I was one of the macam lembab
macam everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year aku buat friendster
dah tak popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook oh I think it was facebook facebook atau messenger it was the messenger yang popular
kau tak tahu messenger apa kan
dia macam chatting punya benda
itu pun I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail ke microsoft so tapi by then aku dah ada messenger terus facebook dah popular so macam bila orang berbual pasal friendster aku macam hmm oh I also had friendster oh nama apa then I was like
if you okay kalau aisha ada time okay lah I know aisha baru masuk poly life kan like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one macam pada kau paling memorable sekali
rabak in what sense
tak ada satu pun jadi monitor ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi lah
since but bila first time kau jadi monitress kan was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes aku tahu aku favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and abang
bila ni which year oh my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject cakap jer lah dah lepas pun
ah class ni tak payah dengar lah
kat ear punya height oh
tak tinggi mana shoulder oh
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you pilih which madrasah you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during kak punya time
kita orang tak ada pilihan unless you choose to change school then kita change school kalau tak all the way kita in the same school lah
so time tu bila dah masuk secondary kan bila primary kan kita orang macam
whereby madam rosanna was our form teacher and she taught us everything dia ajar
dia ajar ah english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday kita orang akan mix so someday we just do all english
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class ah like thirty five of us work together madam rosanna being herself a creative teacher she like do art project untuk kita orang semua and that's how we became closer especially during ah like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
ah during the june holidays lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat artworks for example ah old vases kita orang paint balik to sell during our end kita orang punya tempat yang kita for the competition was at tampines mall you know where dorang have the bazaar sebelah tampines mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar hari raya
no even now yang kalau ada bazaar dekat tampines
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of aku punya classmate dia kau tahu yang vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it yang colour colour purple colour blue macam vanguard sheet oh my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet ah
so dia pakai macam vanguard sheet depan belakang and then dia jual envelope macam untuk envelope macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition kita orang punya class dapat eh kita orang punya sekolah we first time arabia masuk and kita orang menang dapat fourth position
all thanks to madam rosanna so but she put the most effort lah because we were like only primary four kita berapa years old then ten years old we don't tak tahu banyak benda kan so then after that when kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu primary four bila primary five kita split class
they just tak ada
so last time during my dorang tak ada my time right dorang tak ada macam ah yang pandai
yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga kan dorang tak ada split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those yang susah juga lah
korang seven levels seh A B C D E F six okay
oh because they want you guys to focus on studies or ah but did you look forward to that camp so tak ada lah kesah sangat
antisocial lah tu so okay back tu aku punya cerita so bila primary five kita split class tau abeh kita orang punya class ground level ground level kan so satu class satu class it all happen when mummy kan dah start jual kan kat situ so aku selalu stay back
so I think there was a kita orang punya senior ke apa tak puas hati dengan some girl from of course lah boy so dorang macam unhappy with the between class five A and five B ah so boyfriend kat five B suka girl kat five A girl kat five A suka lelaki kat five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six tak puas hati
so what happen was like one of kita orang punya time find that I always stay back pasal mummy jualan kan kat sekolah kan so aku tunggu lah mummy habis baru balik sama-sama what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
ada a few clique until today aku masih ingat pasal that is the same clique
who koyakkan aku punya duty roster bila secondary one
kalau dengar okay so dorang dah koyakkan the duty roster and the next day bila five B datang dorang cakap lah aku yang koyakkan
sebab aku yang stay back
yes and ya ya pasal aku tak hold grudge sangat aku hold grudge yang secondary one punya tapi semua dah besar
so lepas tu then after that after that whole incident
mengamuk ah
tak ah because it was just not me I was with another friend kita orang sama-sama
ah macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan by the time akak balik dia pun balik so all this while kita orang sama-sama but the other class knowing that aku yang selalu stay back tunggu mummy
then dorang ni ah
or maybe bila aku tak ada dekat class I didn't stay at the classroom what I will just stay at the musollah ataupun dekat luar
ah so what happen afterwards was kita orang start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school semua orang kena stay back semua dari five A semua dari five B kena stay back aku daripada five A kan dengar
dorang tak tahu tu primary six aku tahu pasal siapa lagi yang stay back tapi pasal dia senior aku tak ada senior lagi nak tolong aku so it happen to the extent that madam rosanna form teacher kita orang bila primary four gather kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang
then I say you were together last year macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk primary five semua macam gini things like that so in the end kita salam and dah habis ah
tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this kakak-kakak stay back
and I knew the history of all this aku kan orang tengah semua benda aku tahu ah yes
ya tapi time rapat dengan dia so ya
tu lah kakak tak suka tu primary five bila but then bila dah masuk secondary kita masih split class sampai secondary one time tu pun sec one a lawan dengan sec one B
pasal kita just annoyed dengan dorang like there was this one trend semua orang akan pakai this jacket do you know my jacket bukan varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket yang kau tahu yang grey and another pink
pink dengan blue star aku selalu pakai bila bila it was that trend that kind of jacket and ya backpack kat belakang do you know what aku punya backpack yang colour brown yang boleh clip ya okay it was a trend and there's this one group of girls dorang pakai tu
and I was so annoyed pasal dorang macam flaunt dorang punya because it was in trend and dorang macam flaunt and the whole group nanti ambil gambar and things like that abeh aku annoyed gila seh so aku pun tak suka dorang then comes the teacher day punya time tau so bila tengah teacher day punya time one of aku punya classmate instead of tolong decorate aku punya class
dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong decorate kan kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam oh my god abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang until dorang secondary one
then bila kita orang masuk secondary two kita sama kelas balik
kita orang different class after that bila masuk balik secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two pasal by then pun kita dah pindah dekat toa payoh kan so classroom dah lagi besar so bila yang secondary two tu
kita orang macam ada certain orang kita tak click sebab dia gatal
but other certain students we are okay with them ah by then kita dah quite click then after that bila masuk secondary three end of secondary three kita ada secondary three camp
ah whereby dalam secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby kita orang semua sama-sama except kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya time
so other than kita orang semua tak sama-sama actually bila camp itu lah semua orang start rapat
um level one ni kat sekolah mana
I think the only time whereby kita orang tak tidur sekolah so last time kita ada was one week and
apa ni kita orang ada arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language paling susah kan so what was ustazah mashallah beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur a day before the paper I think that was thursday kira arabic paper was on friday so dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang so the reason why kita semua tidur kat sekolah was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead kita of course girls being girls when we are together kita orang ketawa-ketawa and the thing is only girls yang tidur
kat sekolah and there was only one ustaz and another male student to accompany the ustaz lah is the only guy in school ustaz was there to look after us lah tak akan kalau all girls kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi kan
then after that during kita orang punya ni ada something happen again so kita orang tidur dekat creepy honestly even bila camp bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh and last time tak ada cermin last time there was no mirrors then we bila dah new sikit that is scary lah so last time bila masih tengah kat kita orang semua tengah duduk it was already at eleven plus
mah then kita orang pun dah habis revise because we going to wake up earlier before subuh the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school kat sekolah kan exam dia esok pagi semua student datang balik ah dekat arabiah dekat hall
then lepas tu
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang facing parade square I think it was there
lepas tu what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby kereta jalan then bunyi imagine ustaz muhammad kereta was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so tak gerakkan kereta pun semua orang
yang kereta jalan ya
park kereta dekat depan
oh yang sebelah security punya ya
and it couldn't be from the road pasal road dah jauh
so kakak punya the more okay I
tak pernah experience benda-benda seram
sampai orang point out
so meaning ataupun staycation ingat staycation dekat dengan old changi hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu kan so macam
aku macam tahu tempat dia very eerie very seram
our chalet time kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali kan tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis the whole thing baru orang cakap kau rasa bila oh it wasn't only me
ah tapi okay tapi itu bukan the most scariest experience aku ada the one imagine ada satu kali tu kita orang ada staycation eh bukan staycation yang chalet dekat pasir ris
pasir ris holiday flat time itu pasir ris holiday flat baru renovate lagi sekali tau they just renewed renovated that's why kita the year before is at changi yang kita ambil
then the following year baru kita buat kat pasir ris pasal dorang dah renovate tempat dia so ah so that time aku pasal aku tak boleh overnight that day kita orang buat barbecue aku tolong the day before
pasal after that day barbecue kan kita balik siang cik shahrul fetch kita orang
so I decided to help a day earlier because kita ambil four days three night so thursday just ambil kunci friday datang petang decorate prepare benda-benda barbecue then saturday the event barbecue some more then saturday is the event sunday is the punya macam retreat pasal tengah ada submission
poly submission so yang tolong cuma lima orang jer akak
kak sumayah dengan lagi tiga kakak ni ah kak jah kak nana kak nisa so kita orang semua tengah bersih-bersih sekali dorang kena beli benda tau
dorang nak kena dorang nak kena beli benda then okay ah tinggal kakak dengan kak maya tengah prepare pasal kak maya in charge of the creation
so aku tolong ah kak maya potong-potong benda tampal-tampal semua untuk batik remember the batik thing yang korang dapat EZ-link
sticker batik ah ah yes yes ah backdrop dia punya backdrop
so nak kena kemas-kemas then after that terus dorang balik so dorang balik dorang letak benda and still nak kena keluar beli benda tau
so then it was three of us sekejap lagi tengah buat kerja thirty minutes ke apa later
terus google punya ni google no it was google ah google ah atau SIRI SIRI ada pakai iphone
don't say anything don't say anything tengah buat kerja
astaghfirullah astaghfirullah then after that terus balik ah imagine balik kul dua belas lebih daripada pasir ris
kau tahu kan the chalet we slept is tengah-tengah laut eh is at hujung depan dia laut pokok-pokok pasir ris park
so like terus kita orang macam hmm that was the
scary experience pasal aku sendiri dengar I myself heard
that thing that beyond that macam aku kadang is it my just my imagination is it something that because from all those ghost story yang aku tengok or was it just me but this one everyone heard and everyone was like macam
okay let's not talk about this anymore so then cepat-cepat ah habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu
but you don't seem like one aku nak tengok cerita hantu
for telegram ke
classroom yang mana which classroom
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the dia punya ni
mengundang kan mengundang
but those one of the stupid things korang buat lepas aku it was polytechnic punya time like it was during it was between kita orang punya from one class to another oh from one consultation to another consultation the session kalau tak salah eh
so macam daripada april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
then kita orang tengah tengok so from one class to another class is like three hours break pasal kita orang punya class straight so during that three hours we have our own lepak place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class ah tap to masuk
pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk so it became our macam hangout room for our course ah
so what happened was the dia punya laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai projector semua so kita have access to main cerita dia macam cupboard dia buka
dia yang buka the whole thing ah so kita buat
tak ada lah dia just pakai macam ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a macam he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa so
tak ada apa-apa lah so should be okay so kita tengok movie so like majority of us were in the class tengah tengok movie and
since dia is a glass door dia glass door kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita but then the glass door dia tutup dengan projector kau faham ah so kita facing projector belakang projector glass door kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok so like macam some of my classmate dorang tak nak duduk tengok movie dorang nak keluar or lepak with others the mix ah from different courses or just nak pergi lunch so one of aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap eh what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
seven eh bukan eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six umur yang twenty six yang buka cerita shaun the sheep kau faham tak so we were watching shaun the sheep abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa after that kita tengok cerita apa tau final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend yang shaun the sheep keluar dia masuk balik kan kita tengok final destination five dia macam wow you guys ah asal tengok one cerita to the other tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa but that was one of the best ni lah
and another best thing I yang kita orang pernah buat was
main hide and seek dekat airport
akak punya clique my clique dengan a few guys so time tu kita orang dah habis
I think sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal that day I think that day was
kita orang main terminal two kita orang main terminal two ah kita orang main hide and seek the thing is kita orang tak boleh hide dekat toilet ah pasal boys tak boleh masuk girls toilet girls tak boleh masuk but it was so fun
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play main hide and seek paling best
ah teman
kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram ah so during kita orang punya
secondary four secondary five kita pergi malaysia
tak lah no is different tak ada during our time tak ada such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate kita pergi overseas kita pergi malaysia and visit universities to macam kononnya future nak kenal-kenal ah universities luar singapore
so kita orang semua dapat bilik hotel okay lah actually ni cerita seram ah
so kita orang dapat bilik hotel so there are kita orang dibagi like our classes are being divided into three levels so example dia level seven eight nine so level seven semua guys
level nine semua girls
so macam guys punya room this thing is the guys room is sebelah depan girls room sebelah belakang
jauh daripada lift so you have to walk in like macam and my room is one of the last few room for that floor kita orang punya that level kita punya room last few
and kak mun was also on the same floor so kita dua bukan the type yang akan takut because we usually travel go hotel kan so macam benda ni tak akan occur unless before this kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room lah so time tu kita ada ada macam seminar sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya hall ah so aku dengan kak mun pun terlupa something so kita orang kena rush pergi bilik so kak mun dengan bilik aku sama level ah
so kita masuk terus time tu ada hall and it's a long way tau like macam ah the corridor macam panjang have to pass by around ten rooms
the room dia macam zig zag
so kak mun punya room is around seven aku punya room eleven tak salah
sama floor tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua sec five dua sec four dua sec five dua sec four dorang split macam gitu ah
terus aku tengok kak mun tengok each other lari masuk bilik letak benda lari
patah balik all the way
itu the worst experience
tak they dim the whole the very old school punya macam yellow light corridor and the carpet was red
most of the time aku akan pakai
oh ya that's why oh so actually mak aku cakap kan um vanilla extract have gelatin
but kan um mak aku cakap if you want find like vanilla extract atau vanilla essence
kau nak kena make sure dia tak ada gelatin cause most of their product have like gelatin inside
ya that time kau cakap kau nak bakekan aku brownies
so kau sudah bakekan haikal
but we're fine we no we just fight macam sekejap jer lah you know like ten minutes kind
no lah because most of them like I'm cranky but then my cranky is like main-main jer
but yesterday I saw you post about him then kau delete
why apasal kau delete
wait so dah dia ada motor
oh tapi dia rarely pakai motor
um takut tapi lama-lama macam sudah biasa
err spark eh eh sorry aku tak ingat ah dia punya motor semua
no it's either spark atau sniper
mana picnic
um okay maybe not friday since friday hari raya haji kan
okay kejap bila ah okay mostly
next week aku sekolah lah
this week aku tak sekolah next week aku sekolah
but aku tak akan sekolah on the thursday and friday sebab hari raya
ya next week oh eh alamak aku sekolah lah ya allah
okay hopefully nenek aku tak datang sebab she's coming today I think
aku takut she will stay until hari raya
then kau tahu ah kalau ada nenek aku kan macam a bit
eh can we try like um picnic dekat bonnet
they like decorate the place they put like tikar all
then dia bawa like bakul of makanan
ya but aku rasa kau punya kereta boleh ah sebab besar seh
kan habis kau just bawa kau punya
kau punya laptop then kita tengok netflix
wah shiok sia habis kau bawa cushion
ah someone actually ajak me to watch train to busan but then out of nowhere tak update
um tak ada slot then after aku macam okay lah sedih
then dia tak update macam okay ada place you know
then you know and then after that dia keluar dengan abang dia
kan banyak orang sia nak tengok like most of kawan aku semua nak tengok then aku macam
tengok ah siapa first come first serve dulu ah tanya aku
but then end up najrah tak update aku then aku macam okay tak apa lah
ada train to busan kat netflix tak
oh my god you should watch your name dekat anime
ya it's damn fun like it's damn sedih like serious like you will cry like legit cry cry
sebab aku tengok dua kali kan dua kali aku nangis tau
huda said it's damn good so I think you should watch ah aku
akan tengok after my english shows so ya I got a lot of shows ah to catch up on
eh fah jap kau cuba bau yang dia orang bagi yang virus shut out itu
you tengok apa bau
mm bau kau nampak yang benda warna biru dekat atas table tadi
oh maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
kau tahu oh wait
so um kau tahu aku kan
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
Zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu kan
tapi aku punya kan it's like we talk
apa inner soul kau
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
no oh my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
aku cakap like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange kan so aku cakap ah like um
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me ah macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay ah then end up aku dapat five points
I want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
kawan aku eh no huda's sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she oh cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go ah like try but then aku cakap like
cause I'm using hijab what so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
macam it's so pelik like ya but I really want sia
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is kan kalau kau eh
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so I think kalau kau sudah fly bangkok or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like eh just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume what eh you use tudung you know
like macam back to back
but kau pergi bangkok bila
mm aku
for temperature screener dia dekat bukit batok hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
kan pelik dia cakap like note kan dia cakap below like for the note they said um
tak ada aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
I never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
lah aircon tak ada biar like I don't want like I want I need
that time kan aku dapat okay someone I got
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then kan end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing eh it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it
so aku pergi double text like okay I was being annoying tapi aku need a job
and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
um hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text tau
err dia cakap hi yes err dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
um dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever lah I just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes I'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like
are you sure you're okay so aku macam okay whatever
so aku cakap mm
so aku rasa dia annoyed macam bila aku macam tanya like kalau ada aircon ke ada fan then dia tak reply aku sia
tak akan whoever kerja sana macam just mati kan dengan heat dia
eh kau tahu aku tak dapat seh yang that kids club punya
merepek seh
what if what if all of aku punya
month is aku tak hardworking it's just macam nak tak nak

so kalau
kalau haikal dia masuk kau okay
kau excited sebab kau tak payah layan dia
I mean it depends sebab kan
um most of the time is quite lepak
like tengok section kau ah like macam
most of the time like they will only do like macam the important stuff
so kalau
cause zeko brother masuk kan most of the time dia
banyak free time
quite susah lah sebab they have to
but then lama-lama it's quite okay
it's the part yang after itu yang busy gila
he have to think about it lor like you know lagi dia sudah family strict
kau boleh imagine tak kalau ada family strict
then kalau after dia book out dia nak jumpa kau macam mana eh
mak aku finally okay not finally lah
mak aku sudah tahu yang aku sudah patah balik dengan zeko
um okay kau tahu yang the five hundred grant that singapore bagi kita tu
okay so actually kan zeko dapat
but then he have to give back sebab dia
okay itu zeko dia pergi bilang aisha like macam kau tahu macam member seh kau just bilang like about our problems
then after that itu tak apa then zeko sudah bayar like two days after yang dia dapat that notice
then after that kan mak aku cakap dengan aku
um okay cause we were talking about friends lah like aku cakap dengan mak aku
ma like why you like very macam
aku tak tahu like for me and sarah like we realize mak aku macam tutup one eye for aisha
and it's like annoying macam
okay whenever like we balik lambat okay so that time aku balik lambat like aku balik
before one habis aisha like my mum called me a lot of times ah oh yang kau tahu yang
yang aku aku ambil gambar dengan zeko yang kita side by side
ya so that day right my mum dapat tahu my mum called me like around ten
she said err where are you so I said lah like I'm at newton then she said err awak keluar dengan lelaki kan then I was like

so cakap okay lah then aku text sarah aku cakap
how mama know I went out with zeko then she said
sometimes aku tak bilang apa like aku aku tak bagi nama
so aku macam okay whatever lah aku malas nak fikir
so aku sudah mak aku asyik call like around twelve like macam pukul berapa nak balik pukul berapa nak balik
so after that aku sudah sampai rumah like around twelve fifteen then mak aku asyik call then aku bingit
then aku saat masuk rumah aku cakap ah relax lah like it's only
eh like you said our curfew is one but then kau call aku
pukul dua belas semua like pukul berapa nak balik like it's so annoying then aku balik aku cakap
um yang si aisha mana like dia sudah balik ke belum pergi ah call dia
then after that mak aku macam ya lah nak call dia sekarang
then ah then aku macam okay ah whatever then aku bilang sarah like
ya aku sot but then I think it was like my tone
bila aku balik rumah then because it was so annoying so after that saat um
after like five minutes or ten minutes later aisha balik
then aisha pergi masuk bilik dulu ah so aku kat luar so obviously aisha macam nak gossip gossip
um dia pergi bilang sarah
cakap um pasal mariam ah um mama cakap mariam biadap
itu pasal aku kena balik siang then sarah cakap
err apa yang kau merepek eh like curfew memang pukul satu apa yang kau nak salahkan mariam
which is true ah like apasal kau macam
cakap oh it's mariam fault now I have to go home
padahal just because I was rude like macam kau tahu curfew pukul satu like
kau fikir kau special sangat like you know macam boleh balik like any time
like mak aku tak cakap apa-apa pun mak aku just text dia cakap pukul berapa nak balik then mak aku cakap err adik beradik kau sudah ikut kau
err sudah biadap balik lambat semua then itu pasal aisha nak kena balik
so but then aisha was like blaming me then aku macam like
oh ya then mak aku cakap tak lah like err aisha kan
macam okay so aisha's friend right is like macam
so aisha cakap like um eh mak aku cakap aisha punya kawan
um macam family tak ada family support that kind
so kita macam oh okay lah then mak aku cakap dengan aku err so yam kalau awak nak cari
kawan make sure yang baik-baik semua then after that mak aku cakap
so awak err zeko dia sudah bayar yang duit government
so aku dengan sarah macam tengok each other kita macam
like how you know then kita tanya mak aku ah how mama know
then she said ada lah mama ada spy
so aku sudah sot like I was damn pissed off lah I was like
ya then after that at first aku sudah bilang sarah aku cakap oh zeko kena bayar balik that five hundred
then after that sarah macam oh okay then after that out of nowhere mak aku tahu
then um dia cakap ah confirm aisha bilang
then mak aku cakap tak lah um mama tahu jer gitu like mama dengar so aku macam
uh huh padan muka dia like kan mama punya mulut sudah err masam eh masin
mm ah kan mama punya mulut masin like I already told her to not balik lambat or like
then bila aku sudah keluar semua err aisha texted me she said

um huh no lah mama kan ada spy you ask her lah
that you told mama about it then aku cakap um
tak then aku macam aku cakap tak bagus fitnah like anyhow only aku cakap gitu then dia cakap whatever lah
um apasal like mariam nak kena expose aku like
habis sarah pergi reply dia cakap
then after that aisha cakap ah like um like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that betul pe like story itu is zeko's story tapi apasal kau pergi bilang mama
habis sarah cakap kau fikir mariam nak sit back
err habis like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then aisha say oh gitu then aku macam
like you get what mean macam I'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
and and one thing I don't like about aisha kan dia macam
like one time she macam she balik the she said um
apa tu oh she went out to eat with haziq like one of her friends ah yang pernah suka dia
then after dia cakap oh haziq sekarang bawa motor ini ini ini then dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar like kau tahu macam
like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam huh tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then err satu kali oh tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
tadi I mean through text lah
then the tempat
apa eh
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat um atas ni kalau
converse kan nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name kan
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission tau
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if I see my shoes like this
sebab dia punya nike kan she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's mahal
then after that err dia cakap
err dia cakap I was airing it lah habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why mariam so rude then pada aku macam it's basic what it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau ah
habis after dia cakap dengan aku err okay lah so from now
err you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry what like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
um aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam ah whatever lah then err dia cakap dengan sarah I want to buy shoes so like
err mariam don't have to like nag then aku macam I won't nag if you don't
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed I was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use lah but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang lah aku boleh beli habis pergi lah beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
um how to say ah like macam
ya like macam these past few days ah like me and aisha we have like this tension then sarah satu kali
oo I sense tension then aku macam ha lah kau just stop
confirm nanti balik kan dia akan cakap aku err pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time I use her bag
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
she won't ask permission for her macam oh kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like I don't get it
aku penat sia rant pasal dia
far lah it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
um merry eh kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok tau dia pakai macam just
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang kan then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
malas nak go through ah the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu kan tapi dia swee swee jer seh
a'ah macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
swee swee tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah swee swee so like
aku cannot use thick socks I have to use like
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
berapa banyak doc mart ah kau ada
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
macam rare occasion
oh if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
ya I think that one can match my baju because
okay I have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah um tali tau
so kalau aku pakai kan kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
ya dia bukan skinny dia um flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
ya because that baju since that time seh my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct
but then kau tahu aku perasan kan like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
eh baju you boleh nampak dalam kan baju you boleh nampak dalam kan
sekarang bila aku check baju kan aku really see macam
a'ah lah like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet kan
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape kan
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no lah orang like kau tahu sun ah kalau sunlight kan nampak obvious kan then aku macam tak apa ah like
boleh nampak sia like um inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic sia
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too
err macam how to say ah like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam kan
sometimes sekarang aku macam even though aku malas nak pakai
like singlet aku akan just pakai err what ah what's that
the sports bra tapi yang sports bra loose so bila aku pakai at least dia tutup yang kat atas
cause one one time kan aku punya button kan dia
dia very far and aku tak perasan then boleh nampak sia kat aku punya dalam
just hal then aku have to change like my hijab
tapi itu nasib tak ada zeko sia kalau tak dia sudah macam cakap ah siapa suruh pakai baju ni
it's true because if you don't have strict parents right like your parents don't care like if you've matair
ya but then kau
the problem is about kau orang kau orang punya time and like macam parents dia pun quite strict

tak tahu dia orang suruh buka radio

at first I didn't want to tell my mom tau because I scared like dia macam skeptical about this thing and then I was like ah ya this is jian wing ini dari like telegram ada like
this macam channel of jobs itu semua and then she didn't reply
then you tak cakap apa-apa
at first I was like senangnya kerjanya like it's easy for like eighteen dollars per hour seh
I am contemplating whether to masuk dikir barat atau like err I don't know if anyone can added like this
itu macam something got to do with like choir the thing tapi it's not really choir but like macam
ya macam nyanyian ada yang menguar I don't know whether I want to nyanyi or not but I don't know where to find barat
like dia macam ah like
actually dia ada ada ah piano punya tau it say like uh I think is piano assemble carpenter and then I don't know if I if I want to masuk do I need to have like a piano punya experience or what atau I can just start from scratch
uh uh mestinya
I didn't know that ngee ann also got dikir barat
ya ke I don't know I thought was only like
have islam ni ke malay
bagus lah
esok err awak masuk see mostly
you know for the for the person you tak boleh
like honestly honesly speaking I don't mind leaving my parents gitu
mm baloi
your course boleh pergi which uni
but the thing is that like like for example macam hari raya if we cannot go back then a bit sad lah mm
no one in my family have gone to like belajar overseas before so like if I'm the first one to go it's gonna be freaking hectic at the airport
but still right one whole army datang sia confirm dia
can you imagine they everyday confirm everyday mesti kena video call like at least once confirm
but I feel that it's okay if if if the school like provide it feel like a dorm atau apartment like if you if you live in the dorm I think it's okay I think it's ya I think that one can like save a bit of money
but like you know you you have to know how to like behave yourself there are like you cannot be iman kau mesti kuat punya like your your spiritual self must be strong ya
like you me and iffa pergi at the same uni but different course I don't mind though right ya
iffa boleh iffa boleh masak actually
bico boleh buat kerja rumah macam vacuum jer she laju
okay aku tak suka suka baju ah aku tak suka basuh baju
oh jemur kain aku suka cuci baju jemur baju angkat baju suka lipat jer tak suka
pasal right lipat baju kan like I don't know like you have to be station there macam if if for example okay like you say you can tengok youtube and stuff right but I cannot I cannot concentrate kadang-kadang
like a suitable time that I want to lipat baju if like someone asked me to do it right I won't do it like I wouldn't have the mood to do it
oh but if like someone like macam tak suruh and then I just like you know voluntarily do it lah finally
oh you have you read about the news yang pasal yang yang orchard killing tu yang orchard tower well what do you feel about that
I I don't like I don't wanna be like racist ke apa lah but like is the fact like if let's say like kalau um our race yang buat
confirm kena punya kan like lebih rabak but I don't know lah I don't know what was the judge or the court was thinking
just just now I told my like I told my sister lah ya every time I see like the news like cakap pasal
I feel like okay lah like how many is is okay but then it reality actually is like quite serious eh like for example like if I'm in that person shouldn't like macam
like confirm it's a bit like severe pe kan the symptoms and everything and like for me to feel like all takde apa-apa lah like that kind of thing it's like a bit worrying though because I selalu nampak and then like you feel like macam day by day your
feeling towards it macam dah apa-apa jer lah
no I think one of the reason why it was because of the election yang kat sabah
fool ya dia lelaki actually know what to say
ya he said that he said that then I'm like like no even like ah is is not even two week tau and he already said that he dah he he baik already from COVID nineteen I'm like apa seh

so macam rasa dia tak seram sangat it was actually funny
sebab you were just talking about it apa then I saw it so I macam rasa macam eh

eh cause I scared if I tegur then suddenly
no depan lagi no depan lagi depan lagi depan lagi you know they have ever that kind of thing if you tegur and then the thing just follow you
so just diam
so when they send to kallang all the way I walk home right I press the lift I look back I press the thing I look back I before before I go masuk ke rumah I look back because I scared
I scared if I bring that thing home my mother scold me I'm not scared of that thing nanti mak aku macam engkau ni keluar malam-malam bawa benda tak tak senonoh masuk rumah

ya the thing is that it happens to everyone including the lady and all like like it's constant it's not like memilih
gee what what what's wrong with me dulu berani eh tau then sekarang macam open shutter
ya lah that is my bekal lah I haven't eat lah I don't know what to eat
that's why like my break time I really macam because breakfast I don't makan
like unless my mother like prepare for me and I makan ah tapi kalau dia tak kasih then macam tak ada ah
eh japan pula thailand tamarind chicken
wet market and market pasar market
so mee soto nasi ayam sup kambing the best sup kambing in singapore is there
pasar lah
ya we have kedai mamak like you know the movies
at the pasar there where you can find variety of food lah
but like the only thing that I find macam sedap gila
nasi ayamdia in the world
like you can eat the rice only and then you will feel like damn sedap
nasi ayam now
you know those bawah block yang ada own fast food thing
nasi ayam western those chicken the rice is chicken rice
tapi dia punya chicken tu macam yang two wing
like the malay food I would not recommend kalau macam makan lunchtime only during your breakfast sedap gila because that two kedai only open for breakfast and they will close
dia sedap gila they only open for breakfast
siala aku belum tanya pun siol
cheebye tak ada tak ada tak ada tak ada dah habis dah habis dah habis dah habis
hey sedih sia
nak apa dik at least lah eh
makcik ni false hope ah

dah lah aku ni berbulu dia ni pun berbulu
forty five kecil begini jer nanti hug dia
tak nak lah super light gray this is nice this is just nice
oh it's nice pasar makan
pasar makan jer
hey actually okay lah but then like I cannot I condemn nasi campur melayu
it's so mahal
it's called my kampung
chinese stall you know tak chinese stall yang macam economy rice
but they make it nasi padang
ya and then tempat then like got a lot of cuisine and then everything's halal and then like you don't have to worry
sebelah dia ada waffle
siot lah tak ada mood sia
ya but because I think like clifford tu macam kena jalan kena tempuh tempuh clifford kena tempuh like tau
ah tadi kerja macam mana
oo jadi
habis participants pun sikit ah
jadi dia orang bawa banyak duit ah kalau berapa banyak hari macam gitu
um jadi ah apa habis tapi tiga orang jer kan tadi
tadi dari um apa sektor
tak ada lah
tak tadi nenek tak pekik ah apa pagi dia terbangun then dia pekik sekejap lah sebab ini tapi biasa lah dia tak ada dia punya maki-maki hamun lah
then I think dia lapar biasa dia minta pergi toilet tapi dia tak minta solat solat lagi ah dia tak I think because dia nampak mak keluar pergi kerja kan jadi dia tahu dia seorang seorang dengan bibik jadi dia diam aje
um so entah um tak ada anxiety tak ada ah
tapi selalu panggil doktor lepas tu dia orang cakap apa pasal anxiety pill tu
I think err tapi is susah to say ah that this is still moderate like I mean moderate I think is kalau nak cakap apa um penyakit yang bila atau paling terhangat kan like you know heat at the peak right moderate lah is should say I think anything more than this um
I think anything more than this kena redha lah
compared to the past tiga hari lalu lah yang
tapi dia ni memang dari dulu selalu apa bila dia bila orang dekat dengan kita orang apa go nak pergi dia kan selalu at her top
um tak tak senang lah reckless lah lepas tu ah apa terkebil-kebil mata dia kan
tapi nenek timid timid kemarahan dia tahap singa
eh hari tu ambil test yang dapat test dementia tak
ah tapi macam mana sebab test dia kelakar kelakar tanya soalan kan
the dementia I pernah nampak ah like the test to do
um bila kita cakap pasal dementia kita pernah nampak test dia apa um dulu dekat tempat kerja sekarang kena buat dia tapi nama test abbreviated mental test or something
A&T kan then apa macam ada dia orang cakap kat situ I tell you the number one nine seven two
huh what is it ah actually you are supposed to go and get her like tested that like for five years ago like when it was at the peak of the light where she keep asking is it already azan is it time to pray is you already azan then you can get their diagnoses which is at the mild stage because right now already at the moderate right
it is there's some like the guidelines to ah diagnose mental conditions susah like it is continuous assessment because ah apa
doctor cakap macam okay dah dia ni he show like five out ah like out of ten he show eight sign then ya diagnosed with dementia or depression but then apa
doesn't mean just depression kadang-kadang kalau dia datang enam bulan later sekali I am very depressed but I can hear voices in my head telling me to jump down
ah tu dah schizophrenia tu but then you see is like mental condition is terlalu susah cause
it's continuous assessment that's why dementia you'd all these mental condition you get diagnosed early you are follow up by doctor psychiatrist early like continuously so they know they see a progression dia ni oh dia ni dah tukar dah lain
just depression kadang-kadang datang enam bulan later sekali
tapi memang dah ada dah lama pun dia orang abandon yang dekat malaysia pun dia orang hantar apa mak dia orang sebab nursing home dekat situ lagi murah then but you cannot blame lah dia orang kerja apa mana ada orang ada time nak jaga mak bapa kat rumah it's like
tapi kalau kita tengok dalam islam kan macam mana
I think kalau you nak ikut yang orang europe punya is that kita first of all kita singapore tak ada space tapi kalau ada space kita boleh buat tapi dia orang buat dia orang tak buat nursing home dia orang buat macam nursing bilik you know
a nursing home right is very strict like you have to be inside there are because they don't have the manpower to bring you out and even if you can go out err is very risky because later nanti anak dia orang datang complain eh why you let my mother my father go out ah ah you know
mak bapa dia orang yang like oh people who stay at their already they also frustrated they also want to go out okay imagine it's like you've been living your life up the whole life in a certain way out of sudden your place in this new environment lepas tu dia orang macam you want to
quote and be be scold or something also like that right pun tak boleh because apa
family members isn't that in singapore if we don't use it have enough resource kita tak ada banyak kebolehan untuk like build something from scratch start from ground zero we have no space and then it's like
our only resource kita punya apa kita ada is ah hasil kita is orang you know we only have people that I would like crops like that that we can export and import so that's why like
you know those uh I think last time your late aunty ah arwah tu dia duduk situ
you mean senior activities macam tu
but if you have to understand sebab kalau dia orang keluarkan I think banyak sangat orang nak literally like rental flats are never enough in singapore
but um apa
macam that time yang for hundred dollar COVID fund tu orang ambil advantage
tu lah
for like the elderly right is you in okay maybe not in singapore because I'm mean in singapore but why doubt popular another reason is orang dah tua orang nak pergi masjid nak pergi temple nak pergi church
you ada that club house especially as senior activity centre it doesn't appeal do you know that that clubhouse one session can facilitate up to thirty maximum sixty lah if the centre is really big
ya so it's like there are people who have to go every everyday because they are alone and very at risk tapi for those yang habis bad manpower is in low you know like if there's not enough space so macam
and not in the activities to appeal to everyone tak tak semua orang nak karaoke tak semua orang nak colour tak semua orang nak main mahjong ada orang nak pergi church nak pergi solat you know nak pergi prayer nak pergi temple so it's like
they should be away like for it to integrate um the spiritual part plus the active aging but it's just that dekat singapore is black kita neutral kan kita apa
um kita apa macam mana nak cakap apa tu yang
ah kita tak nak emphasize right that kind of thing you know and then
so because of that it is not about how I should say are very highly encouraging play a country to practice your religion first that if tapi kita kena buat moderately kita tak boleh over of course lah kita tak nak extremist kan kita nak be good to our neighbours
it every individual tahap um how religious they are tahap dia punya iman it's more like eat in the bowl
so bila you nak bawa orang orang ni cakap okay ah siapa nak pergi mall nak buat you know macam kalau let's say dia orang taruk rental flat like one of the benefit atau studio apartment eh what are the benefit is boleh buat pergi church temple and
um mosque mosque this mosque lepas tu ah church let's say is a catholic church then ah
but I didn't tinggalkan dia seorang seorang
so I I wanted that I'm not so keen but I'm not so sure about how it will pan out like because I'm not raised in the environment you know I'm raised in like nenek dekat rumah
um how to say ah macam nenek kat rumah so I am not the one that go out to seek my to accompany my elders my elders is the one that um my elders is the one that come ah
anything with me if with my family right so it's like you know that that the dynamic is already different dia punya um relationship is different so
macam mana nak cakap eh I I think it's not that I'm not keen maybe it's the fear of the unknown because I'm not used to it mah so it's like I'm I don't know how will it
um I feel sad also macam budak-budak kecil budak-budak secondary school yang macam dia orang nak duduk dekat rumah dalam bilik dia orang because they are because they are the oldest one
then dia orang nak kena sacrifice nak kena pergi rumah nenek
apa ah for those elder grandkids who have been tasked to take care of the grandparents to accompany I think um the parents should the parents themselves should naturally let it flow you know
oh semalam ada cakap kan the discussion dari kecil is what is important how you didik and show right um
kalau you tunjuk dia orang that oh you have to go you monday is usually is me feel like alamak this is a task this is a task
ah because once it becomes a task it becomes a chore nanti macam tak happy then ya but you know you can never know even though they are your kids they are still human beings you made me me like what they are actually very happy with the idea because for me it be like
why didn't you do lah bila kita nak kena pergi
ke apa kita tak nak pergi sebab apa oh cannot cannot I need to take care of my grandma if my friend ajak me go out nak keluar oh sorry sorry tak boleh tak boleh need to take care of my grandma you know like is it for me nenek dah kat rumah it convenient
ya it is a team effort macam mana dekat nursing home ada satu orang satu orang jer ada tiga orang
ya but so jadi ke masa cakap apalah kebaikan apalah sebaliknya jaga penjagaan like you all this tanya right dah tak cabaran lagi lah so it's just a learning experience
tadi mak cakap yang apa jaga nenek baru dapat tahu macam mana nak lain kali in the future macam mana mak nak dijaga don't you think that is the reward don't you think that is the syurga
is that you have to always selalu
be prepared to tukar mindset
tukar mindset
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh if metaphorically is if you put it in a
you can ah whatever makin turun makin turun kalau you tukar your you will say okay I'm trying to swim now okay swimming doesn't work okay let me take a path I let me do some breathing exercises that me just tried to float for a while you know
swimming you are trying to get to where you want to go you get a cramp in your leg and then there is like you know you patah balik patah balik right kadang-kadang like it can be like
it three weeks of peaceful snipping all of a sudden one day it is ah again ya and apa that sucks lah because
apa kita selalu um try our best too you oo kita nak beritahu mak kita jumpa kawan kita hari tu imagine eh kalau
and dia cakap lecturer dia is ah mak dia pun ada dementia she's the main caregiver lah okay you when even a lady who is teaching nursing who you would know is a pakar a professional in these right in having patience and kesabaran cause they take care kan
she also experiences ya she was experience caregiver stress that really affect her work so what my kawan bilang me was that
uh okay lah dia because dia ada background the towel the thick and jake's dump the limit jacket you should you hire professional you know they know what to do so her her tips and tricks is that the disrupt
the incident was um dia try her very very best untuk mak dia tak akan berak dan kencing anywhere
bila nak berak kan dan kencing I rasa dia ada strategi lah macam every one hour you bring every minute you bring you know that kind of thing she has already picked up the mothers are non-verbal cue err bila dia nak pergi berak nak pergi kencing dia cakap I try my very best I try so hard and it happen
siapa dia nak marah tu dia nak marah mak dia ke mak dia cannot help it kan dia nak marah diri dia ke dia ada choice all along ya so she like even like a I'm not sure whether nursing professionals or what lah but a professional who is teaching
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh ya like okay now I realise that even you doctor you nurse as you ni cuma you you also don't treat the patient twenty four seven
family yang dah ada history with that person and then like you they have a lot of emotional
attachment for nurses and practitioners they can always be like okay this is not working you try as so much with your client you try and like ask them work with then work with the family tapi kalau family do decide that one day
there is a professional boundary where you stop at like you will never go beyond it so like family there is no like is unconditional you selalu kena not not selalu kena actually you have to always be there what not what not
yet studied in that I guess especially in the asian society dementia is the terikut perangai lama jer perangai lamanya mana doktor tahu you know even like as much as you share with the doctor or my mother is like this like this like this
but doktor macam as much they are only able to do so much with the information you give tapi like I
think I had one someone I know right um dia punya mak dia tak nak makan kat rumah cakap makanan tu berpasir lah apalah a'ah macam tak suka kalau anak balik lagi so it's like instead of
sitting and eating that meal half an hour she takes four hours to finish that meal ah but did you know what actually what is the history is because she ya she stay in a different child's house now anak dia yang dulu duduk dengan dia ada dia ada bermampu lah
untuk bawa dia keluar makan tapi dementia makes you lose your ability to communicate right so dia tak tahu macam mana dia nak cakap yang dia nak makan kat luar
jadi cerita dia macam ni mm
dia cerita dia macam ni lah like
dementia is you can um jaga because you have heard stories fifteen years taking care but um it's your ability can you go through it or not and communicate they lose a lot of things they lose communication they lose their memory they lose their ability so
yup so it's very important to communicate with your family members because walaupun jaga dementia ke tak bila dah nak tua like mak cakap the blessing in all of this is that you know next time how you want to be taken care of macam mana mak nak dijaga jadi mak tahu mak nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak so bila nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak sekarang

okay um I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya shopping ke I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya work ke nak dengar pasal kak alin punya wedding
tapi one of the macam
tapi no lah I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something lah for my bags or something
because I remember reading before dia orang kata can just keep
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips dekat dia orang punya zips covered kan in in like its original packaging kita tak buka so it's all just there abeh kita takut ah okay so I thought was safe
abeh I followed his wife macam a luxury person lah okay on instagram abeh dia ada macam Q&A session gitu sometimes abeh dia punya one of dia punya itu is um don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime abeh if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then um the humidity and also whatever whatever
ya so so I'm worried about it tapi kalau if I ask him to keluarkan
then tak oh my god tapi that time itu saya tengah because saya beli banyak benda kan then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because kakak dia belum keluarkan her clothes
so in that so ada a small section where I can put the stuff lah abeh
you know bila macam nak unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag ah macam all nice gitu kan so woohoo open it up
then tak enough space tau so long as it can I can you gerakkan your tempat baju sikit so that I can more space lepas itu dia how why you just taruh dekat atas lah then no nanti crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is kalau kak suruh dia like can you keluarkan this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
nanti dia just macam campak or whatever nanti semua like I don't know nanti macam crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why macam oh if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now kak punya kerja like
just nak duduk rumah ya
um because now dia apple boy he got a macbook
then when your contract ends kita sama tak mine is on february
tapi yours is the same kita sama plan kan ada abah
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think dia punya pun end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone ah
ya then macam all the other laptops macam will
ah then macam not bad ah then like ya macam
macam all the food that abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai seh
then dia okay lah then dia ya
no I just thought macam
I tak tahu I tahu macam when I hear macam the oh the android versus apple whatever macam android punya argument macam their specs is better
and like sea creams like sea cream pastels and dia macam you know that marshmallow and macam round gitu swirly gitu it literally looks at that considering the pathway is not
ah macam film theory
kan film theory on youtube kau dah tengok I feel like ada
I tak tahu fashion so back to the basic
ya cause I tak adventurous so saya tak adventurous
saya takut stick out
okay saya tak tahu ring so
the vibes eh the vibes get a little vaccine also hello it's just it's just tampal there anyway
aku tak tahu period aesthetic tau aesthetic kita tak ada the third eye aesthetic close
kita tak ada vibes kak ada I would say um FOMO
ah ah macam oh she looks nice let me copy that look
I have macam oh okay I like this I don't like that outfit ada lah but macam
it's not like oh I the whole genre of that outfit I suka
ya lah academia lah macam sweater um with like pleats and like straight cut pants
you know kak benda semua dekat my table black and pink
oh so kak limah macam on that scale kak limah macam on a six
I'm fine with that tapi dia end up with um macam best so been tested
um he's kinda like dia just not a nice guy
I don't remember if dia ada err actually I do I don't remember if dia ada err apa macam character change plot whatever what is it called ya character development I don't remember
ya macam huh asal dia ini ya actually all the guys in gossip girl boo humphrey boo they just macam oh oh it's me okay I don't fit in macam okay relax
zero number first affordable need archie bol something like that okay I get it macam kau kaya okay archipelago I teller I david archuleta
weird but no archuleta is doesn't he doesn't even sound macam atas
archie bol dia how to spell archie B O L oh
he's like in the upper class you know cause ya tak humphrey macam humpty dumpty you know he's in the dumps period serena serena van der would said okay she has she has european blood line okay
I mean I'm sure macam small characters lah but the main cast their white
dia macam oh my god brooklyn dekat a part of new york
so macam school high school ya dekat ya the show started dia orang high school that means it's high school season so by the time case dia orang dah kerja dia orang dah kerja some of them kahwin so
dah kahwin dah ah si chuck bass kahwin si blair waldorf si selena kahwin si dan ah I tahu dan lah he main the netflix you know the you the stalker that's dan and then selena is siapa nama selena eh
blake lively selena william selena wiliam sejak bila nak sama tak oh tersay then blair waldorf selena booked dia the waldorf brown hair ah siapa
there's two the main character I would say two girls and three guys two girls three guys ther's one more girl tapi dia macam I think
I was like tak salah lah at the end dia macam
um I at the actress some something and then dia macam tak so so present either like ending last season something like that the actress herself macam problematic something like like that lah dia macam dia macam indecisive punk life then dia macam I think so lah there were some like drama whatever contract tak ingat ah something something but
kalau if I remember correctly she wasn't macam so
I tak tahu I tak tahu dia nak pursue music something like that she had a rock band and that no she's blonde she's like super like platinum blonde and tapi dia ada pakai like eyeliner macam wow macam black the character also not nice
towards the end agaknya lah ya
anyway dia dan punya adik in the show
so there's three guys and then ya I think the two guys if I say the name you don't know who ya because dia orang after gossip girl dia orang tak so popular
no itu
skaters pretty liars ah no pretty liars tak ada boys actually ada boys but dia orang macam not
maybe I don't even know what the guys look like ada ada boys but dia orang macam not so
aria aria the rambut macam besar gila kan

eh why we talk about this ah what were we talking about gossip gossip girl pretty little liars okay anyway tak tahu siapa gossip girl then

lesen motor buat apa tak boleh duduk ramia-ramai apa lesen kereta ramai-ramai ah
apa-apa keluar man bawa kereta
macam ni ah shafiq
so dia punya ex contact
mm ya tak malas ah
tapi kalau macam shafiq dia nak orang yang high maintenance tapi dia tak boleh maintain orang tu
tapi takde duit ya
he only expect the car to kirakan macam
oh sekejap jer kan rasa dah dua ribu dua puluh satu dah
kan dia macam january february march december terus
tu ah
target berapa target
wow eh tapi kan khairul aming buat kan fifteen dua bulan tau ah tak dia memang dia memang makan sihat eat clean and he did skipping like for every day
ah but memang kak long vegetarian kot of course you can do it
mm menarik menarik
of course I have a lot tapi kita kena prioritise lah kan mana yang for this year and nanti next next year kita buat lagi yang lain kan
okay before this rasa boleh survive lima ratus sebulan sekarang gaji pun tak cukup untuk survive bulan-bulan so plan resolution untuk dua ribu dua puluh satu adalah untuk
mm make my own business uh untuk for side income lah part time lah part time for fun
mm ada two things actually which is dah started dah pun ah macam tu tapi kita
kita slow slow lah menapak kita punya business kan first uh untuk buat surprise delivery
sebenarnya kan nak buat surprise delivery ni I tak rasa pun nak buat
dia bukannya more to untuk duit tau it is just that I feel happy to see people happy
faham ke ha macam pergi delivery pergi pergi buat delivery kat orang nanti orang tu surprise eh dapat happy dapat surprise gitu kan macam seronoknya macam tu lah lagi satu the
the other part yang best sebab selepas delivery ini adalah bila kita
pack surprise tu kan so kalau orang tu order nak ni ni ni kita pack dia punya surprise box tu kan bila pack tu rasa macam
uh we pour love in that box faham ke
boleh customise lah sebab kita tak nak macam idea macam mana eh kita nak every gift tu comes with thought
orang tu sendiri fikir dia nak bagi hadiah apa bukannya dia dia bagi bulat-bulat kat kita oh okay uh I nak set A dah let's say macam tu kan which is set A dia memang kita dah provide
then it dia macam tak comes from heart truly tau ha
ha kita macam gift creator lah macam tu
everything is possible apa jer orang tu nak kita akan make it happen kan
end of november tahun lepas kot start
ah ada dua customer and more to come
hmm betul
then satu bila macam selalunya kita surprise delivery orang yang order surprise delivery ni orang yang tak boleh nak pergi hantar sendiri
so dia part oh part yang orang tu pergi hantar part tu dah tak ada tau untuk orang tu bagi dekat but macam nice ah kita nak bagi kat orang kan
so part yang kita pergi hantar barang tu dah tak ada which is dalam surprise tu satu part tu dah tak ada kita tolong buatkan that's why customisation tu penting maksudnya orang yang nak bagi hadiah tu
dia memang gift put in thoughts dalam apa yang dia nak bagi orang tu walaupun dia tak boleh hantar sendiri tapi thoughts tu ada ah
a'ah dia bukan the for the sake of just giving but giving with means lah macam tu
nama dia kotak riang okay boleh search kat Instagram pada kotak riang okay
yes that's right tu satu second is
err ni macam baru jer start like semalam first of january err a'ah but err this one
tak tak tak buat sendiri lah just drop ship barang orang lah kan err nak jual healthy food
uh dia uh makanan-makanan yang orang yang nak diet orang yang nak sihat cari faham ke

main sukan lah berdebat lah apa semua kan so it was very interesting life
interesting as well because I have my own money kan very interesting tapi
come back at home like for six and then at ten dah kelat sebab penat and that is very non healthy lifestyle for me lah so in twenty twenty one my resolution is to have
no no that's not the I want some me time yang can benefit myself as well bukan macam me time just leisure time lepak-lepak tak ada tak ada
a'ah betul dulu ingatkan abah kan main guitar kan then semua anak-anak abah ni kan angah sorang jer yang
ada keinginan nak main guitar kecil-kecil dulu kan
so I yes darjah darjah enam kat kedah dulu

something yang dah ada base eh
ada satu yang angah teringin nak err enroll in mandarin class a'ah I don't know ah I think I really I really have strong interest in language
betul lah I I really learn to love new language I think mandarin err is my choice right now because
apa dia a'ah
ah tengok
mm betul tiba-tiba dah berjaya
and one more thing I think macam macam kak long kata lah belum kaya lagi kan but in the process in the journey sepanjang-panjang nak jadi kaya tu
you actually contribute a lot to the society mm from the the fundraising that you made or daripada the job that you created for other people
you know those small small things actually walaupun tak kaya but it means a lot kan
mm betul
mmhmm betul
what is your advice for a startup macam angah
tapi cakap pasal start up tadi kan sampai sekarang tak puas hati lagi tau
han ji pyeong patut jadi hero
mmhmm betul
pasal dia dah bring the character tu
a'ah betul
betul lah tu tapi nam do san tu hais geram jer lah tengok
um ni macam very small small small thing tapi important lah
tak nak procrastinate ah
kan sebab itu lah punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh ha hapo pun takde
betul err and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better faham ke macam like very last minute tapi it push us to to make a better thing faham ke ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard lah actually faham ke sebab ya maybe maybe
so tahu lah kita ada deadline kan deadline is twentieth october lah konon kan but the boss want to see the progress bukannya on twenty nine tu I can do everything faham ke
yes betul
hmm tapi susah lah
the the algorithm dia mmhmm
a'ah eh tapi kadang-kadang kan bukan kita sebut tau benda kita fikir pun macam keluar juga
pelik kan angah rasa dia tanam chip lah
mm sometimes benda yang kak nor cakap dengan umi pun macam nak beli apa-apa benda tu keluar dekat angah ha
ya entah entah camera ni so scary
tapi kita pun sedar jer kan like the like kita punya that time ada yang kelat
memang terus scroll bawah sekali tick
internet internet ni they works in a very interesting way
live okay lagi ni some people err even make like house tour kot
I think I think that is very something that unacceptable to me lah maybe others think that it's for fun but for me it's like you are showing to people how to enter your house faham ke
dah lah mostly yang buat tu semua wealthy people
ah faham
but I think kan angah pernah dengar satu video ni
err actually kita boleh set for err ni for iPhone users lah kita boleh set set for one day how many hours that we spend ah bila kita dah exceed kan dia akan keluar notification that you have exceed the the total hours of err social media or something like that lah for today
hmm boleh boleh set dekat phone I think we can also keep track lah on that day how many how many time on the day how many time how many hours
ya we we are adults takkan nak ada parental control lagi
a'ah oh ye ah
eh seronok lah
eh orang nak tengok nak try ah
menarik ah
kan I think that this is how we would faham ke
kita akan more determined
if we can see what is the result faham ke kalau kita macam okay four hours nak concentrate kita tak dapat sebab kita tak nampak apa-apa kita tak boleh nak materialise benda tu tau
ha oh walaupun apps yang acknowledge pun it's enough
betul betul betul betul kan kita manusia memang mcam tu ah
ah apa dia
oi menarik
kadang-kadang kita nak tengok waktu pukul berapa sekali a'ah lepas a'ah betul
betul yes
that's correct anyway cakap pasal kucing tadi dah entah lah kucing ni kan diorang ni macam addictive eh
ya ikut suka hati dia
ya betul tak tak tahu lah kita bela kucing untuk apa sebenarnya
tak ada hati kan kadang-kadang kan kan kalau kita adopt kucing kan macam kita pergi adopt kucing kan tapi kan macam orang kata
it is not you who choose the cat the cat choose you faham ke
dah lah diorang selalu buat dumb things tapi kita still bela bagi makan
but they pee everywhere kenapa elegant
huh dia kan tidur terkangkang tengok kucing-kucing kita
that is very interesting kadang-kadang kan teringat kucing ni pun boleh gelak sendiri tau
angah terfikir satu benda but it's very random lah tapi something that angah memang selalu terfikir lah bayangkan lah kan kalau tiba-tiba
ada zombie apocalypse apa kita akan buat
tak sebenarnya kan zombie ni boleh jadi ke
ya betul
ah kat rumah a'ah
eh I think angah pernah sembang dengan kak long ke siapa dulu ke it is only my imagination but I think we have plan before that we want to sell zombie survival kit pernah tak kita ke itu imaginasi angah ada
uh huh macam cukup makan cukup first aid ah kan
oh it's not specifically for zombie lah tak beli ke a'ah
war ke mm mm
tapi kan cakap pasal bunker tadi angah terfikir lah kalau kalau kita buat rumah kan kita hire contractor
then the contractor will know everything about our house isn't that dangerous ke sometimes I would think that way lah macam okay kalau kita buat secret room then the contractor tu akan tahu secret room kita kat mana what if the contractor have bad intention
ah lepas tu ah faham aduhai
oh back to cat conversation cakap pasal cat ni kan diorang addictive
eh kalau kita pindah rumah baru kan I really want to build a catio for our cats
mm betul
ah that's what I was thinking about catio tu dekat hujung sekali depan tu swimming pool
so when we were swimming kita boleh hi kucing macam tu
and and sometimes I feel like I want them to swim with us as well boleh ke kucing boleh berenang ke
oh comelnya kalau kucing berenang
oh ye ke
steady boleh berenang ah
macam glasshouse lah kan cantiknya
and itu lah kita punya permulaan kepada segala-galanya tak ada harapan tak ada
perancangan so tak ada apa-apa kan takkan tiba-tiba terjadi selain ada pelan kan
siapa ramai tak percaya time tu
mm mm betul
cakap pasal cross country kan
kesian kan tengok ramai stewardess steward pilot yang laid off sekarang
mmhmm memang tak boleh langsung boleh lah but a few flights jer yang boleh pun sekarang
tapi tapi tapi pasal steward and stewardess ni kan ada cadangan untuk bawa
err steward and stewardess jadi macam helper lah ataupun additional staff dekat poly lah sebab diorang ada basic first aid punya basic ha
a'ah betul
kan a'ah sebab dia memang ada basic
betul mmhmm
pastu kebanyakan yang kena sack yang kena laid off
pun akan start business akan start buat business
because that's the fastest way untuk kita do something instead of waiting for jobs to come to you
employer pun tak semestinya nak ambil kerja dalam waktu sekarang
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul
social yup betul betul
actually kan kalau tengok macam junior junior pun kan ada pun ramai yang
ya betul satu err satu sebab
jarang lah kita buat assignment sorang-sorang waktu dulu pun mesti discuss dengan kawan-kawan share jawapan like very very normal things to do kan tu satu second
our youth feeling faham ke
mm betul
ya lepas tu dah habis online learning
tiba-tiba graduate online then terus masuk kerja
then you will you ya we have to face a very hard life waktu kerja without your friends anymore
mmhmm experience pula
I think dekat china err they even built a academy for influencer kat china korea takyah cakap lah korea memang
itu memang like being famous is like
most of their punya ambitions lah ya being famous become actors actress dengan idol idol
tu lah tapi
budak-budak muda sekarang memang look up to
because artist ni orang akan minat dia sebab character yang dia bawa dalam drama character dia bawa dalam movie but influencer ni orang minat dia apa atas apa hidup dia faham ke so that's why people lagi look up to influencer daripada
mmhmm betul
eh apa kak long punya macam
for our family lah kan apa kak long punya resolution
mm dan angah rasa sejak kan sejak kita punya ni movement order ni angah rasa kita pun memang banya spend time
mm together sebagai satu family
I think same quite the same things juga lah
I want all of us to be involved together in everything that we do faham ke yes macam
main dengan kucing memasak ke
a'ah betul cantik-cantik
they can remind us satu lagi satu we want mm make them
we want we want to prove that we can do it to them faham ke macam angah cakap dengan kak long gini kan mesti angah rasa macam kena tunjuk ni boleh buat ah ah takkan cakap kosong jer
