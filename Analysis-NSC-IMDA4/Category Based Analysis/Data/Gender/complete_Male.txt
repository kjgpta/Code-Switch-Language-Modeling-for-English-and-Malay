need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job [ah]
so like
so like (um) for me I I pick the shipyard job [ah] because I heard of like very good like (uh) what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing [ah] because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing (uh) <malay>bila kau</malay> sail [kan] (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>enam</malay> months like that
six month <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] away from your families [lah] which I don't think I personally think I cannot [ah] you know
ya that's why [ah] cannot [ah] you know
for me I don't know [ah] we usually we like homesick [ah] you know so I go
on overseas
but it's definitely something <malay>aku macam</malay> look forward to [ah] like in in the future [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah]
then also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay (um) <malay>apa dia</malay> [eh] [oh] okay
(uh) I haven't pick yet [ah] any yet
but like I planning to [ah] so now <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) my first year [kan] [ah] I only got to like try out the different [ah] so like we all can like
<malay>apa</malay> choose [ah] the various types of sports or
club activities [kan] so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
<malay>kat sekolah</malay> we you can choose [ah] so I for the for me I pick the <malay>apa</malay> floorball [lah] like something new [lah] for me like I never try before [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
okay [ah] I find floorball quite interesting [ah] like
quite fun [ah] you know enjoyable your [ah] <malay>kawan kawan</malay> you know quite fun [ah]
but like honestly it's not something I like [ah] as a sport [ah] you know if
<malay>apa</malay> sport I prefer
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay got offer quite a few sport [ah]
you know you got <malay>apa</malay> soccer and basketball got tchoukball <malay>gitu</malay>
but I I don't know [ah] for poly I maybe won't pick like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) sports [ah] I will definitely choose something else [ah]
maybe like okay so for they got clubs [ah]
(uh) clubs as in <malay>macam</malay>
okay so you know got different schools right
got like the engineering <malay>dia ada punya</malay> business
then you got my school [lah] called the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs [ah]
so my one is (uh) club
then <malay>macam</malay>
I was planning to join [ah] in the first year <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak dapat</malay> like you must go for <malay>apa</malay>
(uh) interview [eh] (um) when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply [kan] then I went for the interview
like I talk <malay>banyak tau</malay>
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I <malay>tak dapat</malay> you know
[ah] that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like !walao! [eh]
[ah]
ya that's why
but hopefully if I tried apply again <malay>dapat</malay> [ah]
[ah] that's why (mm)
ya ya true [ah] it's okay [lah]
sports
clubs [ah] I think clubs can [ah] but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can [ah] so possible
kay
so like for you [kan] Nads</P2>
your school what what course you take [ah] for you I know you are in year one but what course [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then what are the modules you will like learn
like for your course other than like programming <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) okay
[ah]
for me personally [kan] (uh) I enjoy the <malay>apa</malay> workshop [ah] not for like year one
because I <malay>apa</malay> secondary school I <malay>pilih</malay> [ah] what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology [ah]
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me [lah] cause I got experience in secondary school [kan]
so like for me is (uh) is fun [lah] cause it's actually something new [ah] some s- some of the what (uh) workshop practice or something you like welding (uh) you got the two types of welding <malay>macam</malay> gas welding <malay>ngan apa</malay>
arc welding [ah] something new [ah] then I <malay>macam lepak lepak</malay> you know
but (err) on workshop cause I workshop [ah] <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> four hours [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is (uh) about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A [ah] you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun [ah] for me
really enjoy [ah] cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun [lah]
ya
ya
then okay for my course right (uh) they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like (uh) different kind of <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia punya</malay> skills [ah]
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three [ah] is where like the interesting part [lah]
cause no no no before the internship [kan]
(err) <malay>apa</malay> they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like <malay>dia macam ada</malay>
what [ah] the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine (uh) fuel system you know so like for us (uh) students right before we go for internship right you must understand [ah] all these kind of (uh) machinery how it works
cause if we just go for (uh) what [ah]
if you just go for interview [eh] no sorry my bad but instead of interview <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) internship when you go for internship (err) what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills [ah] before our internship
[oh] what also [ah]
[oh] ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this (mm)
[eh] they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
(uh)
(uh) purifier room okay purifier room is <malay>macam</malay> like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right (err) you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test [ah] it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like (uh) as the water level rises so it's about five minutes [ah] it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
if I'm not wrong <malay>kita</malay> will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the okay eventually the water level will rise [lah] but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast [ah] ya
ya
ya that's why
that test [ah] honestly I haven't experienced yet [ah] cause I only year two now [ah] but something I look forward to [ah]
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me [ah] cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly <malay>macam</malay> like inspection you know like okay as
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or (err) what you call the inspector [lah] so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into [lah] like that [ah] ya
ya hopefully [ah] (mmhmm)
not bad [ah] not bad [ah]
<malay>ape benda</malay> like other things I do other than in school [lah]
kay for me right <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) in my free time I like to game you know
spend a lot of time playing game [ah]
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right (uh) I start off with mobile gaming [ah] then I started moving to <malay>apa dia punya</malay> competitive scene [ah]
(oo) #shiok# [ah] I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two [ah] then the prizes <malay>macam</malay> (uh) gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
<malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so something [ah]
something to kill time also [ah] in secondary school you know
then for you [eh] your free time what you normally do [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what got any I join right then for you [eh] cause like you know you are like
(uh) year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any for your poly have or not
legit [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(oo)
(mm)
so okay [ah] based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first [ah] cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a like promoting for you to join right so you go see [lah] which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
ya so you obviously <malay>ada</malay> experience [kan]
so maybe you can make it to what (uh) #Temasek# poly (uh) floor ball team [ah] who knows [ah]
ya who knows who knows but I know the floor ball team very competitive [ah]
know
(mm) can [lah] you just you just go for it [ah] <malay>dulu</malay>
see which one you like the most y'know
[oh]
today [ah] I just finished my
last paper you know today
[ah] okay [lah] because like <malay>semalam</malay> I got study like the whole night you know like <malay>macam</malay> two
(uh) got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one one two hour paper
[oh] my goodness legit
so much to study
okay [ah] hopefully hopefully [ah] hopefully hopefully can pass [ah]
but then [ah] after the paper like
at three <malay>gitu</malay> I went for an appointment [ah]
for what [ah]
it's for like
how should I say <malay>macam</malay>
for my
infection [ah] or it's like how to say it's like a pimple [lah] you know in a sense and it bleeds [ah] so I have to go for appointment [ah]
check up first
and I read up ya it it's very painful and very itchy you know
but then I read up [ah] or on this right it's actually called the pilonidal cyst you know
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation [ah] so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) it's a weekday and there will be there won't be a lot people [ah]
but then when I went there [ah] my goodness
like legit a lot of people [ah] I tell you !alamak!

then you're so crammed you know
[oh] my goodness
some reason I thought week day three plus
nobody will be there [what] right but then got a lot of people [ah] should have picked another day
the surgery [ah] okay so like kay just now I went for the appointment right then the doctor right keep
advising on the surgery
like okay [ah]
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery [ah] cause like I'm only eighteen [kan]
then like it will affect my future [ah]
cause this surgery is it's like
quite risk [ah] quite high risk [ah]
have to like what cut open that [one] put me on anaesthesia
<malay>gitu</malay> then
once they cut open they take out the <malay>apa</malay>
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
(uh) pull a skin
<malay>macam</malay> a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
so I cannot imagine [ah] [a'ah]
[ah] confirm painful [sia] legit

you know when you're like kay now
you finally in right
then there is like you must start studying right you know do you ever like procrastinate when you want to study
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
for me [ah] I also procrastinate [lah] like you know I prioritize my (err) playing games over doing work [ah] my assignments [ah]
but then again if like <malay>apa dia punya</malay> deadline is like
very close right then I'll start doing [ah]
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time [ah] you know because if
I don't do right then my will be affected <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me [what] so I obviously have to start on doing [ah]
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over [ah] then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it [ah] you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle [ah] this issue of procrastination cause like
<malay>aku selalu macam</malay>
always [ah] since secondary school [ah]
always prioritise my games over the
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> our school work [ah] ya
(mm) !wah!
damn
ya it is hard [lah] but you know we must [lah] you know
it's very hard [lah] then okay like okay
through I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course <malay>ada tak</malay>
ya group projects like that
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
okay
me [ah] okay I have [ah] okay recently
like for this semester one [kan] (uh) I have this (uh) project called the module name is which is <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
social innovation project [ah] (uh) ya
so like (uh) we all <malay>macam</malay> is
I think combined with
(uh) different types of (uh) people from different courses [ah] so like
(uh)
(uh) two from then <malay>macam</malay> two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for <malay>apa</malay> (uh)
to do a project together so basically this like
what is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry [ah]
so equips you with this kind of skill [lah] but let me tell you something [ah] I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you [ah]
cause like (err) it's damn #rabak# I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like !walao! [eh] why why got so much workload [ah] [ah] I don't want do [ah] like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
[ah]
like this
ya
[ah] then okay okay this [one] [ah] it happen like
<malay>macam</malay> a few weeks ago before our final group project so like (uh) it was during (uh) hari raya haji right
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal [ah] for our presentation slides
then these guys right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to (uh) help them with something and present then when I tell them <malay>macam</malay> I say I cannot [ah] I like damn busy today I got my
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate [ah]
then
[oh] then they say [eh] why like that we you the only malay just come [lah] then I say how can like that I holiday [what] hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
[oh] my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining [ah] keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school designs right
they should know the different type of <malay>apa</malay>
(err) the type of programs <malay>dia punya</malay> different types of software [ah] to do like animation <malay>ke</malay>
or like do some drawing design [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] I tell you [ah] these guys [kan] is even the girls <malay>tau</malay>
they <malay>diorang semua</malay> they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of <malay>apa</malay> different type of drawing you know
[ah] !alamak! legit I tell you I don't want [ah] but it's okay [lah]
ya but overall I think it's a good experience [lah]
cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together [ah]
and also ya it's good [lah] so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made (uh) okay you know for our project our aim right
is to help people with depression you know so like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
to help people with depression integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely [kan]
[ah] they are like damn lonely right
!alamak! why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
more with <malay>macam</malay> (err) people [ah] online people online [ah] like strangers you know not in not strangers [lah]
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use [ah] then we decided to come up with something interesting for them [lah] cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
(uh) our the depression app [ah] counter
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing [ah] like <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>apa</malay> the
Pikachu [ah] Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
then our app also <malay>ada</malay> you have (err) what [ah] you have the therapy consultation tab
kay so what's so special about this tab right
(uh) when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app [kan] they can (uh) what [ah] (uh)
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual controls right so when they talk then they type right say (uh) how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
(mm) it's it's quite cool [lah] honestly
and also (err)
you can also prompt for
(uh) real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one (uh) what (uh) questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool [lah] ya
ya (um) and also for our app right (uh) we also put what [ah]
(uh) since like most of us like like to game [ah] like we
most (um) people like to game like they download apps for what
(uh) games right
for most people right then
[ah] our app introduces like some mini short games [ah] so you got heard of (uh) what kind of games [ah] (err) like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
[ah] Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
some mini games [ah] like also we put (uh) animal crossing [ah] concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
(um)
games for the user to play with [ah] which makes our app interesting [ah]
ya a lot of people [ah]
(mm)
ya so our app
since our app is based on (uh) like I said the <malay>apa</malay> [eh] the <malay>macam</malay> Pokemon [kan] like the virtual pet right
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins [ah] basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to <malay>macam</malay> what I decide to do [ah]
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
so like the shop right we also have a shop [ah] the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put (err) like the what [ah] poke food poke food includes like the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
what ramen or some like cookie [eh]
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon [ah] which is I think quite cool [ah] so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to [ah] ya
forward to ya
so that's about it [ah] for my module interesting [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong (uh)
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two [ah]
ya semester two [ah]
it's called (err)
[ah] communicative I can't remember [ah] what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
<malay>macam</malay>
(uh) improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach [ah] like one of them is [ah] time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance [ah] it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right [kan] do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what [ah]
what's that [ah]
[oh] your interview skills [ah]

(uh huh)
<malay>kamu letak kat mana</malay>
<malay>kat mana</malay> [ah]
<malay>letak dekat</malay> thigh [ah]
[eh] so you actually contemplating on putting a tattoo of a pirate ship on your thigh
[orh] but like of all the things a pirate ship [ah] that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something (uh)
ya
sure sure
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] its like
the spur of the moment that kind of thing [eh]
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through [lah] !huh!
but you would think
!huh!
[ha] I didn't know [oh] ya yes ya recently like one of the <malay>budak yang</malay> [dah] he came back to station what last night
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of #angmohs#
then the guy like <malay>bawa motor</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
then he <malay>bawa motor</malay> then he got tattoo then the #angmoh# like [eh] !wah! you are so cool then the malay guy was just like
#siao# [lah] <malay>ini semua malik</malay> in singapore <malay>ada</malay> [sia]
<malay>bukan apa yang</malay> special
but he like just step step <malay>begini</malay> [ah] like that
but the #angmohs# were like you're you're so cool
ya [lah] he working at some burger
like the standard [lah] <malay>kadang kadang belakang</malay>
on the arm
it's a <malay>belakang tangan dia begitu ada apa tu</malay> flower something like that [ah]
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>ada</malay> colour <malay>punya ke</malay>
<malay>tapi beberapa beberapa begitu beberapa ratus</malay> [ah]
[orh] I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people [ah]
no [lah] it's just like her own <malay>macam tak ada kerja nak buat</malay> then just
brand tattoos for her friends that kind [ah]
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first [lah]
which is <malay>macam</malay> <malay>gila</malay> [sia]
<malay>macam tengat buat kerja tidur</malay> [ah]
[ha]
actually
you you know you know about the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>bekam</malay> before
<malay>yang bekam melayu dia</malay>
[ah] like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
[ah] so <malay>yang kalau melayu buat</malay> it's called <malay>macam bekam</malay> [ah]
then there's like the <malay>bekam kering dan bekam basah</malay> so the <malay>bekam basih</malay> right it's they poke
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part [lah]
so while I was getting that thing I was just thinking [ah] [sia] [lah] <malay>sakit</malay> [pe] this one confirm <malay>macam</malay>
I think like this is what tattooing feels like [ah]
and maybe if you ever think about getting tattoos again you should go for the <malay>bekam</malay> first [lah] then
you see how it feels [ah]
but like <malay>sakit gila</malay> [sia] it's like
<malay>pedih</malay> [ah]
like getting injections over and over again
okay [lah] I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast [ah]
like really rapid
<malay>sakit</malay> [ah]

was that on impulse also or what
<malay>habis</malay>
(uh huh)
(uh huh)

then <malay>bangun</malay> like <malay>bangun</malay> like I don't know [lah] like ten eleven that kind then <malay>balik</malay>
I mean okay [lah] no rush like not like I'm in a rush to do anything also so like okay [lah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [ah]

[orh]
then <malay>keluar makan semua semua</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa ramai ramai</malay> [ah]
[sia]
[oh] then my medical call
not bad [ah]
quite interesting [ah]
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill [lah] yes [ah] okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
<malay>kalau merepek ke apa</malay>
not <malay>nak merepek</malay> [lah] but it's like <malay>tak tak tak</malay> serious [ah]
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
as in we were rushing up but <malay>tak macam lari tak lari</malay> [ah] just like brisk walk that kind of thing
then we reached the lift lobby
we reached the lift lobby then suddenly one guy came running then he was like panting and <malay>berpeluh semua</malay> then he come in already
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
(err) are you the one who called just now then the guy was like [ah] ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he [oh] his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is (uh) pretty rare [ah] to to to see like shocks getting given by the [ah]
ya but the guy
<malay>beberapa</malay> shock [ah]
[dah] <malay>beberapa</malay> shock already
<malay>tapi</malay> they shock all in the ambulance [ah]
(uh huh)
[oh]
[orh] but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping [ah]
I I think so
<malay>itu kali bila dia orang jumpa dia tak tak</malay> breathing [ah] no breathing no pulse
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
[oh]
[ah] quite fast [ah] actually cause <malay>yang abang dia jumpa dia</malay>
so <malay>dia abang jumpa dia</malay> then he collapsed so I that one maybe estimate five
<malay>tak</malay> (um) I think I think five ten minutes max until the brother found him
then the <malay>abang</malay> straight away he called nine nine five then he started doing
then I think nine nine five dispatch the near the my responder app <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] ya people actually use that [ah] do you know that people actually use that
compulsory to what
[oh] serious [ah]
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay [lah] I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay [lah] that guy quite nice the the community responder
he <malay>naik basikal</malay> then he cycled over
cause he was at home [ah] he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah]
so from from no breathing no pulse [ah]
[oh] ya that guy
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so it's within like ten minutes <malay>kena buat</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tak buat</malay> then
confirm gone [ah] is it
<malay>macam</malay> just show show face [ah] okay
(uh huh)
got the what again
[ah] the the one and two and three and four and that kind [ah]
[ah]
wait that was a doctor [ah]
<malay>asal boleh</malay> [jer] doctor
it isn't you know
!wah! <malay>rabak</malay> [pe]
#sian# [sia]
who gets to do as in nobody want to do [oh] nobody wanna do
why [sia]
(uh)
!huh!
but (uh)
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also [lah] so he was saying that
cause
when this is a new thing also [ah] like during out time was it or <malay>tak ada</malay>
[orh]
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is [lah] but like
I don't know [lah] like a bit half useful a bit half <malay>macam</malay>
no point
cause I don't think I don't think anybody would ever get conveyed their [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>siapa</malay> about conveyance
[oh]
like normal alpha <malay>tak ada buat</malay> [ah]
so can [what]
!huh!
[ah] ya ya the ugly one [lah]
[oh]
ya ya
[oh] ya I #ding# was telling us [lah]
actually they can <malay>buat</malay> [ah] <malay>habis buat</malay>
<malay>terus yang nyonya tu</malay>
<malay>dia ada</malay> feeding tube so <malay>makanan terkeluar</malay>
<malay>habis cakap busuk gila</malay> [ah] so then he straight away ask the boy to take over
also he said <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>nak muntah tu</malay>
like <malay>busuk sangat nak muntah</malay> you take over [ah]
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the [lah] recall
[ah]
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
medical relay [ah] <malay>habis dia nampak segak entah</malay>
okay [ah]
cause I came also like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai seluar</malay> [jer] [ah] bunker <malay>dengan seluar</malay>
then the top helmet <malay>put tak pakai</malay> so it's just
<malay>bawa</malay> that one medical <malay>punya</malay> equipment bag then <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah]
then go up
but okay [lah] fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress [lah] cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no [lah] but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya [lah] definitely [sia]
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge [lah] but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the [ah] take charge
cause the [dah] <malay>kena buat</malay> one year course [ah] as in their attachment to the medical side
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
last time <malay>macam</malay> indefinitely [kan] <malay>dia orang kat</malay> medical side
but now makes sense [ah]
ya
and fire bike
!huh! ya <malay>ke</malay>
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
[oh]
(uh huh)
eight people
!wah!
but <malay>asal boleh sampai lapan orang buat</malay> is it wasn't like alpha be come like on time and then
[oh]
but wonder how often it's actually being used [lah] in
[ah]
[ah]
[eh] my friend from #paya lebar# also the madam told them don't turn out [sia]
they said they want to minimise
[ah] they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
[ah] fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I #suay# [ah] my
it's just my <malay>sekarang</malay> like <malay>baru</malay> like #ons# [ah] <malay>sikit</malay>
ya [sia]
don't know [ah] apparently it's the first time [ah] that
only the
they said because of the or something [ah]
but I don't know [ah] not really buying it
ya <malay>baru tukar</malay> about two months ago
okay [ah] #bo pian# [ah] just go [ah]
then they also all the all the people were like
he ask us like (uh) sec com for I left [oh] ya the worst part is that <malay>dengan</malay> is double meaning now
so like the one five <malay>tu sekarang</malay> is on repair
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
cause the crew is the exactly the same so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>sama</malay>
ya so it's called double meaning [ah]
so like
ya [lah] so must just be extra alert
okay [lah] but as in #bishan# usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
then ya [lor] that's my last duty [ah] double meaning but I left <malay>tak ada</malay> call [lah]
ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
not bad [lah] at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay [lah] interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
like <malay>betul betul</malay> I need to do on somebody I think I'd be a bit more confident now
ya
<malay>pasal macam</malay> before this you only <malay>pernah dengar macam belajar</malay> theory [kan]
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different [sia]
what didn't you download the app
[ah]
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>apa</malay> office <malay>cakap</malay>
I think for you all different [lah] cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay [ah]
download what
[oh] no [lah] I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
[oh] the card [ah]
[oh] for a as a reservist [ah]
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>siapa</malay> [sia]
what did I what did I teach you
[oh]
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
(uh huh)
[oh] I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected [ah]
[oh] ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know [ah]
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
that one they are not choking already [ah]
!huh!
so in the end convey <malay>ke tak</malay> convey

then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
(err) something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> there's this very thick
heavy door <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
that you can close
[ah] so like
then two of them [dah] <malay>terkeluar</malay> so got one guy left inside
then <malay>dia orang dua macam main main</malay> [lah] so they
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then <malay>dia orang tunggu kat luar</malay> then like [eh] <malay>asal tak perasan</malay> [sia]
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
banging on the door like <malay>tolak tolak tapi tak ada buka</malay>
and like the <malay>lampu</malay> was on everything
then he like
[sia] [lah] like <malay>tak ada buka</malay> [ah]
so then he don't know why okay this part this part is (err) a bit scary part [ah] he don't know why but he went to <malay>panjat</malay> to the downstairs the scary part
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
so it's like you can take the ladder to go downstairs to the first floor <malay>punya</malay> fire fighting store
then which doesn't make sense because
downstairs is confirmed locked <malay>apa</malay>
if upstairs <malay>tak buka</malay> then <malay>korang</malay> downstairs is like even worse it's gonna be locked also
but he climbed downstairs
then he climbing down the ladder he looked down <malay>gelap</malay> [kan] then he saw like a figure in a corner like swing back and forth <malay>begitu</malay>
[ah] then he like <malay>panjat</malay> [ah]
then he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs
he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs then after that then the door opened [ah]
then door open then he like he told them [ah] what he saw
then the two people outside like [eh]
but we didn't even close the door [sia] we just like we just held it ajar
<malay>tak tak dengar</malay> [ah]
ya that's the
that's almost as scary as the <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
as my my my call
as in not my call [lah] but the one that guy <malay>kena rasuk</malay>
mine is mine is like first hand experience [lah] this one is just <malay>macham</malay>
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
okay [lah] but to me now that I'm not to me now that I'm not staying in station in anymore like <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah]
ya
K brother <malay>tapi semua ramai ramai</malay> [pe]
[seh] [ah] <malay>tak boleh baik baik</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak buat benda tapi masa</malay> secondary <malay>juga</malay> [ah] boy <malay>karipap</malay>
then what you doing tomorrow
[ah]
<malay>baju</malay>
(uh huh)
[oh] so you buying for yourself [lah]
[orh]
[ah]
vaccination vaccination <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
[oh]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] take [ah]
ya I
I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen [kan]
then I I was having headaches like every week
then I thought like okay [lah] maybe cause <malay>tak cukup tidur ke tak</malay>
<malay>salah bantal</malay> something like that
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
[oh] shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
(err)
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing
cause I was googling it's called photo

!hey! [lah] how are you man <malay>dah lama tak jumpa</malay>
really really long time <malay>semenjak aku</malay> last <malay>jumpa</malay> you right so how long do you think <malay>kita dah lama tak jumpa</malay>
no I think <malay>kita tak jumpa</malay> for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right (err) last year when do you remember <malay>bila dia</malay> start
COVID <malay>bulan sebelas</malay> COVID <malay>bulan</malay>
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so <malay>dah lama gila</malay>
right
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory <malay>aku rasa</malay> is that
<malay>aku baru balik daripada</malay> my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that <malay>kita dah tak jumpa lagi</malay> for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
(err) my mum <malay>bilang aku yang nurul</malay> is pregnant was pregnant and then after that [eh]
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and <malay>asal kau tak jumpa dia</malay>
yup
how old is your daughter now
[oh] my god you see
you see
it's [ah] it's he's a it's
he's turning two this coming december so that is how long that I've not seen you
and the the irony is that you only live like two blocks away from me
and we used to be very very good friends <malay>semenjak kita orang kecil lagi</malay>
[lah] you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time <malay>kita orang jumpa</malay> I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet <malay>abeh kau nak berbual</malay> english <malay>pun dah susah</malay> [kan]
just after kindergarten okay no no no no no no no no no because if you remember correctly right for the longest time
(err) from my memory is that we went for <malay>apa</malay> [tau] performance ya you know that that was like some <malay>bengkel kanak-kanak</malay> or some do you know remember <malay>aksi mat yoyo</malay> when we used to be there was remember that show <malay>aksi mat yoyo</malay> it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
(err) we met up at <malay>mak long punya</malay> okay so <malay>mak long aminah suriga</malay> is the like the producer for those kinds of (err) shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes <malay>pasal dia</malay> it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
(mm) <malay>mak long</malay>
yes we just performed our buttocks off ya and you remembered in her house there was like there's there's like
a mini stage where she you know it was in like her I don't think that is her living room her house her flat was quite big
then <malay>kita orang</malay> and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so <malay>aku</malay> I remembered that [ah] <malay>kita</malay> start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are <malay>kawan baik</malay>
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> how they became friends [eh] yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you <malay>dulu</malay>
<malay>rumah mak long</malay> correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam</malay> performance and then I remembered doing shows <malay>kat situ</malay> with my sister <malay>dengan</malay> your sister <malay>dengan</malay> you together so it's #sriwana# yes yes you see now it's all coming back
ya lots of memories there but very (err) blur
vague
cloudy ya ya you can use the word cloudy because it's (err)
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes I think <malay>kita orang</malay> were quite active in performance because I remember (um) quite vividly there was this particular show <malay>kita orang semua nak kena</malay> remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a <malay>kebun</malay> is it <malay>kebun</malay> in malay
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
<malay>engkau ada topeng</malay> [lah] but I do not have a <malay>topeng</malay> so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because <malay>lembu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> horns right so I need to be a <malay>lembu</malay> with horns so what I did was during the song of (um) old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing <malay>dia orang punya topeng</malay>
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me [lah]
yes ya
ya but at the same time I was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
<malay>kita</malay> happy go lucky just go with the flow <malay>mak cakap apa kita buat</malay> then after that <malay>jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu</malay> then just <malay>joget</malay>
in front of people
you were a duck I remembered <malay>kau itik kau itik</malay> because they had if you remember there was this disney <malay>nya itik</malay>
and then after that the
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be (err) not confirm just to be sure [lah] [kan] <malay>kita orang ni iya</malay> [lah] [kan]

(err) you were <malay>itik</malay> okay so
I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay [lah] the word is forget ladies and gentlemen (um)
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] so (err) the next memory is <malay>bila aku dengan kau</malay> we were in your dad's car
<malay>baru balik daripada</malay> some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right <malay>kat luar</malay> some [lah] community centre <malay>dulu dia orang cakap apa</malay> [ah]
ya ya ya we all so it was it was actually quite (err) at that point of time I did remember that <malay>kita orang</malay> we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I I I remembered that (err) we were doing good stuff [lah] which we did not know was good at that time
ya (err) <malay>aku pun ingat yang</malay> that that we get to perform then after that <malay>balik</malay> so getting back to the memory <malay>yang</malay> in your dad's car <malay>aku ingat bapa kau</malay> because your your your <malay>bapa</malay> was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so <malay>kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam</malay>
manufacturing
okay cool cool but I remember <malay>kereta tu kecil</malay> then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time <malay>kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke</malay> and so we were at the back <malay>dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang</malay> and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like [oh] so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
right no no no continue no no no ya
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now <malay>kita dah tua ni</malay> [kan] it was very it was because it happened by (mm) ya so I'm not sure okay so your
this was another traumatising part (err) on my end
<malay>pasal</malay> your <malay>bapa</malay> suddenly <malay>pusing belakang</malay> then <malay>cakap</malay> can you guys stop it or not
so I was (err) you know I got quite scared of your dad <malay>daripada hari tu aku macam</malay> [eh] hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these [lah] and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes <malay>aku rasa</malay>
I guess so ya I guess so
maybe <malay>dia bingit</malay> ya I mean we <malay>kita orang</malay> deserved it <malay>seratus</malay> percent we deserved it
[oh] ya [ah] we were kids we were
just stop [lah] like !whoa!
ya but you know
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know (err) I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that <malay>nak bilang kau</malay> [jer] that was a memory [ah] ya your turn
right
(hmm) [oh] my god
I remember those moments of education <malay>yang aku tak</malay>
forced that's the word
really [oh] that was so sweet of you <malay>aku</malay> feel so (err) yes
yes <malay>aku terharu orang cakap</malay> so
really <malay>pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa</malay>
you know what I felt the same way about you
<malay>engkau bukan seorang</malay> ya
[oh] I remember I know where you're going with this I <malay>aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda</malay>
and
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well <malay>pasal aku ingat</malay> at that point of time [kan] you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle <malay>ada</malay> tank <malay>warna kuning</malay> it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then <malay>lepas tu ada</malay> seat <malay>kat belakang</malay>
<malay>untuk kau duduk</malay> then after that that bicycle <malay>kecil</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang</malay> each other it's a chopper
what
[oh] my god I remembered
right
right (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
we ya
I remembered
I I I I try to describe it [ah] so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are <malay>tengah hisap rokok</malay> [ah]
then we were doing [oh] and you know ya that was
we were very very happy
right
[oh] ya
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any <malay>macam</malay> dustbin <malay>tak</malay> [kan]
but
it [oh] ya yup yup near our house [ah] ya the one opposite our house <malay>kat rumah bawah</malay> block #farhan# if you remember correctly
yes I remember that part also and another thing which I also remember was that (err)
brother john
<malay>salah</malay> brother love
no
love
brother brother love
john J A B C D E F G H <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] same [ah]
ya I <malay>aku</malay> understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then <malay>kita lupa nama dia</malay> and then after that <malay>nama dia apa</malay> then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and [eh] he looks like a john you know [oh] ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe <malay>apa</malay> [tau] [lah] like they did (err) they did a study about this <malay>dia orang cakap apa</malay> [tau] <malay>siapa yang dulu</malay> (um) <malay>buat</malay> show <malay>dengan mak long gitu</malay>
(mm) <malay>siapa siapa</malay> the kids that <malay>buat</malay> show <malay>dengan</malay> #sriwana# so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if (err) if you know like if I get to see her [eh] <malay>mak long</malay> hi remember me she probably wouldn't <malay>pasal</malay> ya
ya you can say that I have a <malay>janggut</malay> it's okay because I I saw you staring at my <malay>janggut</malay> and <malay>aku</malay> realise <malay>yang kau tengok dengan macam</malay>
right
okay
you
I mean you are very positive
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole <malay>janggut</malay> thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do <malay>kalau</malay> if you don't mind <malay>janggut ni sebenarnya apa</malay> [tau] if for me [kan] <malay>aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas</malay>
<malay>aku malas</malay> (mm)
ya because I realise <malay>bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk</malay>
<malay>kau tak keluar janggut kau jadi gemuk</malay>
ya but <malay>gemuk</malay> is okay because you know (err) I I don't mind but
what
right right right right right I I feel that I feel that you are trying not to raise up that that that whole thing about you know fat people are lazy or whatever ya I (err)
yes (err) I mean my mum is quite
fat and I love her and my dad loves her very much you know (err) ya she's been quite fat for
quite some time
(mmhmm) okay (err) I remembered when we we went to primary school together right we went to #xishan# primary school together which is in #yishun#
like I am one year younger than you if <malay>kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka</malay> [jer] <malay>nampak macam</malay> ten years older from you and of course <malay>aku punya</malay> attitude is very mature
bye
right
(err) yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other <malay>kita akan jumpa</malay> each other <malay>bila</malay> (err) <malay>macam nak balik sekolah</malay> so <malay>kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan</malay> thing sometimes
you know that kind of thing so
[oh] no
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory [lah] because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so (err) what happened was (err) after primary school [kan] <malay>pergi</malay> secondary school <malay>tapi aku</malay> went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from #yishun# you see I went to saint andrew's school (err) which is located <malay>dekat</malay> #potong pasir# so <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] saint andrew's <malay>kat</malay> #potong pasir# so saint andrew's <malay>dekat</malay> #potong pasir# (err) <malay>aku</malay> had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school [kan] <malay>mula pukul tujuh setengah</malay>
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty <malay>pagi</malay> then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around <malay>pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah</malay> then after that
ya
normal timing correct so during that point of time we <malay>jarang jumpa</malay> each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
<malay>dekat dengan kau punya rumah</malay> so which is northland secondary school
see how lucky you are and you are living in (err) your your place right is located whereby it's
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because (err) there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking <malay>kau punya pemandangan</malay> [kan]
warning sign [ah]
that what you must be like <malay>terkencing dalam seluar</malay> [eh]
confirm <malay>kena rotan</malay> with your mom confirm <malay>kena rotan</malay> with your mom I remembered because your mom is (err) your mom is very strict (err) woman from <malay>bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam</malay> quite (err) (err) how to say how should I put it [eh] verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because <malay>sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih</malay> best friends you know I mean I mean not as close [lah] because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that <malay>datang balik</malay> fade away <malay>datang balik</malay> but I I appreciate the
the connection still
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my <malay>mak aku punya</malay> birthday ya and guess how old my <malay>mak aku</malay> is
<malay>mak aku</malay> is sixty six years old [lah] that is (err) there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
so yup
and
your father because I think we did have this conversation
(err) at one point of time
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for <malay>bulan puasa punya</malay> time
<malay>bulan puasa punya</malay> time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or <malay>kita pergi sembahyang jumaat</malay>
yes so we did [lah] but not not not for a very long time [lah] <malay>sekejap aje kita lepak</malay> then after that (err) I bumped into your dad
(err) he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said [eh] uncle (err) how are you because your dad always speaks in english then <malay>mak kau berbual melayu</malay> so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
[oh] ya ya ya my dad also [lah] my dad also speaks english
[ah] then after that (um) ya so (um) your dad <malay>aku jumpa dia</malay> then after that (err) you did ask me this question before [eh] <malay>bapa aku umur</malay> seventy almost almost eighty years old <malay>kau cakap gitu dengan aku</malay> then <malay>aku ingat macam</malay> [eh]
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old <malay>kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda</malay> [tau]
like around my dad's age [ah]
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say <malay>bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul</malay> your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad [lah] my dad will exercise <malay>tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke</malay> he should be at home or <malay>dia keluar rumah</malay>
as in to to do his exercises right
amazing <malay>macam bapa aku juga</malay> my my dad will wake up like early
and he will do the the simple exercises with the stretches no I I did introduce him to yoga but I I don't think he's interested in that
but <malay>tapi</malay> you know looking at him stretching <malay>aku rasa</malay> he is still you know quite active in that sense <malay>pasal sekarang</malay>
(err) during on his birthday right two years ago I think <malay>aku belikan dia basikal</malay> for his birthday present then <malay>sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar</malay> as often
ya he starts to like cycle so
like I'm actually happy for him you know because
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now [kan] <malay>dia orang dia orang kasih</malay> (err) facilities for the old people <malay>untuk dia orang</malay> workout
correct ya yes correct correct so (err) what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to <malay>masuk</malay> class [ah] join a class <malay>yang</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so <malay>dia orang ada</malay> this skillsfuture <malay>punya</malay> thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some (err) security course so ya so
I guess I mean
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards <malay>bila kau nampak kat</malay> condo then after that [eh] uncle how are you
okay [lah] same same [lah] like yesterday also <malay>takde ubah sama aje</malay> like that [lah]
ya so (um) (um) he will be one of those and hopefully he be going strong you know like for a few more years [lah]
ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him
what do you mean
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking <malay>pasal kita orang punya</malay> growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>asal</malay>
ya
yes yes that's a good segway actually because (um) I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially <malay>pasal aku</malay> realise <malay>engkau sampai sekarang masih macam</malay> (err) doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still <malay>buat kau punya</malay> music <malay>semua</malay>
ya
(hmm) okay (err) is it it's due to the whole COVID <malay>punya</malay> situation <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan]
[oh] you do (err) facebook <malay>punya</malay> session like live <malay>punya</malay> session is it [oh] that's cool you know what I found out that (err) one of our friend's <malay>apa ni</malay> boy #cazly# because I did meet up (err) met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time [lah] so <malay>sekarang dia</malay>
when we hang out that time <malay>dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka</malay> a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook <malay>punya</malay> account I am not a
not say active [lah] like I am not interested in the whole thing I I I don't know maybe because I'm like you know I like it's weird because okay
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information <malay>daripada</malay> you know the social media but <malay>untuk aku</malay> I
I don't get my information from there I go to the news I direct news and all this
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time <malay>macam</malay>
the reason why I do that is just <malay>tak banyak sangat</malay> information coming in from left to right too many points too many (um) you know opinions from the social media <malay>dia punya</malay> community
so I don't and as as you know I'm quite introvert also
am I ya I think so ya I'm quite introvert ya so ya because ya I I rather you know
I rather be alone
and I'm not lonely !wow!
<malay>tak</malay> I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> does that make sense to <malay>kalau aku cakap</malay> I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely (hmm) do I have an imaginary <malay>kawan</malay>
no no no
ya I mean but
why
okay so like basically just to be updated <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> [ah]
so what you're telling me that you have like (err) you have you are talking about facebook right okay so <malay>dalam kau punya</malay> facebook <malay>tu</malay> you post like funny funny things
right
but
ya I ya you know what I definitely one hundred percent

those must be the youtube commenters [oh] my god
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to <malay>macam apa yang kau berbual tadi</malay>
yes the the the punk (err) phase of our life
how did I get into the current music that I'm listening to well okay how did I get
roughly (um) you know (um) (err) as you know I'm working from home right now right so <malay>aku ada banyak</malay> time <malay>kat rumah</malay> then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar <malay>apa nak beli</malay> you know this is this is a typical (um) you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just <malay>pasal aku ada banyak</malay> time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes
yes [lah] as you know <malay>aku dulu main</malay> drum <malay>asal</malay> it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated [oh] ya you do
right
<malay>yang penting kau</malay> terror !wow! that should be that should be your next (err) malay album <malay>punya yang penting kau</malay> terror
<malay>dengar</malay> [lah] <malay>kita orang punya</malay> record <malay>baru</malay> which is called <malay>yang penting kau</malay> terror
ya <malay>dan sekarang aku main</malay> guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication <malay>nak kena</malay> invest <malay>kau punya</malay> time <malay>main</malay> guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late [lah] I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school <malay>punya</malay> time at the point of [kan] <malay>kau dah</malay> start <malay>main</malay> guitar you know and all this <malay>kau dah</malay> start <malay>main</malay> cranberries <malay>kau dah</malay> ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and <malay>aku pula</malay> when I was in saint andrew's school [kan] <malay>aku belajar</malay> drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then <malay>bila kita masuk</malay> band together we had a few of our friends then <malay>kita masuk</malay> a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
<malay>yang penting kita</malay> terror yes just like your the name of your future album
yes correct so
talking about drums right you were talking about drums is it
guitar right [oh] sorry
(mm) that's that phase of my life
ya yes <malay>pasal</malay> okay (err) the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music <malay>pasal</malay>
at that point of time <malay>kita orang punya</malay> band <malay>dah tak ada lagi</malay> then after that <malay>kita orang</malay> decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to (um) dance music
some techno <malay>punya</malay> stuff some (err) defected (err) record stuff which is quite cheesy [lah] to be honest with you like (err) they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor <malay>punya</malay> beats <malay>macam</malay> that kind of music so (mm)
so <malay>aku dengar</malay> (um) techno <malay>aku dengar</malay> tech house then there were few other house <malay>punya</malay> genres [ah] so they they had (err) like like like different
genres like sub genres [ah] within that that genres so I listen to specifically <malay>macam</malay> tech house deep house that kind of thing so (err) it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
(err) I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that <malay>kita orang dapat</malay> a few gigs <malay>kat</malay> #sentosa# <malay>dapat main kat</malay> club <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
in my in my perspective at that point of time I was like doing it
(err) because because right
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> music <malay>tu</malay> I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey <malay>dia orang punya kerja ni</malay> is to mix (err) <malay>satu lagu dengan satu lagu</malay>
so <malay>dia tak ada</malay> stop [ah]
right correct
yes for so for example <malay>macam ada satu lagu</malay> if he's playing in turntable A right so that <malay>lagu</malay> belongs to an artist correct so from my (err) end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
in a playlist you know because the whole thing about
(um) or house music or that point of time it's just to get the the whole flow the whole energetic flow of dancing you know of having fun in the dance floor
<malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err) I would
<malay>lagu</malay> original it's preferable [lah] you know you know that's the reason why like <malay>kalau nak</malay> have a band to play (err) like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have (err) you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so <malay>aku rasa</malay> that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then <malay>kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya</malay> chord <malay>belajar dia orang punya</malay> style of music
correct (err) back then yes (err) but
in that kind of genre [lah] in that kind of context (mm) ya I mean the whole thing for me <malay>aku rasa tak</malay>
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like (um) in #sentosa# which is an outdoor <malay>punya</malay> outdoor like
(mm) not restaurant like a disco
disco discotheque <malay>mak mak cakap</malay> discotheque <malay>kau pergi</malay> discotheque <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> discotheque [ah] <malay>mak</malay>
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then <malay>lepas tu aku</malay> manage to do my own company so I hooked up with (err) a friend of mine then after (um) together he was from america then we <malay>kita orang</malay> joined forces
(um) to create to have a company so we we brought a a brand which is from the brand is called (err)
[oh] my god how can I forget this
(err) <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> wait wait <malay>sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa</malay> that was quite some time ago (err) so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then <malay>kita</malay> launched <malay>kita orang punya</malay> own party [ah] so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment (err) value to singapore which which is at the highest standard (err) at that point of time then <malay>kita orang</malay>
<malay>buat duit</malay> apart from that you know we (err) charged people at the door <malay>kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat</malay> bar
so we managed to make (err) money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail <malay>dalam tu</malay> then ya [lah]
(err) now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing <malay>aku punya</malay> guitar
ya I've been listening to what got me interested with there's a lot of guitar driven bands

<malay>tak</malay> [tau] [lah] that time I was
(um) maybe I'm getting old <malay>ke</malay> whatsoever <malay>ke</malay> maybe
that's the reason why [lah] or maybe it's too powerful [lah] <malay>dia punya pusingan tu banyak</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> know <malay>dia punya</malay> movements a lot [ah] that's why make me
make me headache
[ah] maybe that time before I ate a lot [ah] <malay>banyak</malay> at that time <malay>banyak banyak sangat makan</malay>

then [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>rasa</malay> I want to vomit
<malay>adik</malay> I feel uneasy [ah] headache [ah]

<malay>tak menarik</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk untuk orang muda-muda</malay> okay [lah] but for old for senior citizens
I think they cannot afford (uh) to to ride that kind of (uh) rides [ah]
(uh) the best part also last time we did was (uh) what's that

satisfying [ah] we we were able to ride (uh) most of the rides (mm)
<malay>nampak macam</malay> best [ah]

I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya <malay>bila</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> travel <malay>lagi macam</malay> camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
<malay>bila</malay> time <malay>nak makan</malay> we can <malay>makan</malay> or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus <malay>lima puluh</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar</malay> he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
<malay>pergi</malay> pub [eh] <malay>pergi</malay> pub hot chocolate !wow!
[eh] so was the first time that you felt snow or <malay>macam</malay> how was it [ah] <malay>macam sejuk gila ke</malay> or like how was it
[ah] K
[oh] okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K [lah] at least you were sort of prepared for it [lah] to happen
[oh] okay [eh] <malay>tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk</malay> [ah] I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right <malay>macam</malay> hot chocolate or like
I don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate <malay>dekat</malay>
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it [ah]
like it was like an (um)
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
yup yup correct [ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
<malay>yang</malay> the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then <malay>bila</malay> wombat <malay>tu macam bau kita punya makanan</malay> !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come <malay>tak ambil gambar</malay> [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kecoh saje</malay>
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like <malay>kesian</malay> when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay> COVID <malay>pergi mana</malay> [eh]
[eh] but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
<malay>dia penat gila</malay> [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in [lah] like I need my dose of man
ya I really hope this goes away soon [seh] K <malay>tak sabar</malay>
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
<malay>tapi rasa macam</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] <malay>selamat tak</malay> seasick [eh]
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
weirdly I miss the supermarkets <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] <malay>kelakar tak</malay>
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so <malay>lain</malay> right
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that <malay>kita nak</malay> save <malay>duit</malay> [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
I don't know I <malay>rasa apa dah pakai</malay>
(err) wait (err) K let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one <malay>yang kat</malay> farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was <malay>dekat bandar</malay> like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and <malay>macam</malay> all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] <malay>macam</malay> modern
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# <malay>yang mana satu</malay> [seh]
yes yes I remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream <malay>macam bunga</malay> like that <malay>macam</malay> the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but <malay>macam tak</malay> memorable <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
ya but if I had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (err)
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
<malay>tak</malay> I'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
<malay>pening</malay> [seh] I <malay>tengok</malay>
ya
<malay>faham faham</malay>
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
<malay>macam</malay> there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so <malay>macam</malay> you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're <malay>lapar</malay> like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
<malay>borong</malay> market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
<malay>macam</malay> it wasn't it wasn't like popular or <malay>macam</malay> ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like I remember there was one <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] flavour <malay>ni macam</malay> some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
<malay>pisang goreng</malay> is it <malay>pisang goreng</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> they said that it was <malay>pisang muda goreng</malay> or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] <malay>mana nak dapat</malay> [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie <malay>sebelum tu apa</malay>
ya
what's dragon's den <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh]
<malay>ini macam</malay> shark tank <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but I miss (um) ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas <malay>macam masak sendiri</malay> and all [kan]
ya
I do I do like <malay>macam</malay>
like you know when we were craving for
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or <malay>teh tarik</malay> shop and pay an exorbitant amount <malay>untuk beli</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay>
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than <malay>kat sini</malay>
what what what what do you miss
<malay>kau</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or <malay>apa apa yang sedap sangat</malay> [ah]
okay okay
livable boy <malay>sama makan sama hidup</malay> [eh]
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there I think <malay>malam</malay> [eh]
a pie pie face
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! <malay>rindu gila</malay> [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes <malay>kat</malay>
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like
like like I didn't even know something <malay>macam</malay> so basic and simple can taste so <malay>sedap</malay> you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait <malay>apa</malay> what was the filling <malay>dalam</malay> jacket potato <malay>dia lupa</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> order <malay>lagi lepas tu</malay> ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
<malay>sedap sedap sangat sedap</malay>
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and <malay>macam</malay> ya things are just
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita boleh buat kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby <malay>duit</malay> [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
<malay>macam</malay> ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores <malay>pasal dia orang suka</malay> touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
<malay>yang</malay> unbeatable [lah] and ya you I think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand <malay>tapi macam berlambak</malay> [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester

[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the <malay>manis</malay> one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
I see I see
yup
so what siesta time basically <malay>macam</malay> nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never encountered this before so
<malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] madrid
he <malay>pernah kerja</malay> at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large <malay>macam</malay> like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your <malay>ni</malay> the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]

I mean I don't think I want my legs
like this

I don't need to be full [lah]
I just wanna like because I don't have make up
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but like
you know how the korean pictures look like
like singapore but not singapore you know
you know I know you know
[eh] <malay>aku nanti</malay> photoshop
is it okay !duh!
(oh) okay maybe nearer ya
ya okay maybe I should show my <malay>baju</malay> a little bit
so like black and yellow black and yellow you know little bit fuck
okay
so funny
okay like this it's so hot
okay I should try editing it with light room
[oh] look like
<malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
(oh)
okay
okay later I will edit I will try to edit with lightroom so <malay>nampak macam</malay>
I because I I used I edit like preset on my lightroom <malay>punya</malay> account
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
is is more like <malay>untuk</malay> photographer [sia]
but you can learn [ah] it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so I love it [sia] no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much how much filter how much (um) you edit [ah]
like your preset the <malay>macam</malay>
the higher your
your saturation (err) contrast and all that right
the worst the the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less
ya
that's why that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of (um) effect and then like the effect you put how high it is [ah] technically
[kan] and that's what my photographer friend said [ah] and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
[oh] is my card with you
okay
(mm)
ya same as you right
[oh]
[eh] but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take [what]
like if I end before eleven forty five
(mm)
but will that minus off like my pay
(oh) okay that is nice
(mmhmm)
it just enough time for me to take home [lah]
so like can I have to go back to orchard
[oh] [oh] the stop the bus
<malay>tak de</malay> bus stop <malay>dekat</malay> somerset somerset also will be easier [ah] because like somerset have take
then I stop at #dhoby ghaut#
[ah]
<malay>duduk sana</malay> [ah] <malay>depan</malay> laboratory <malay>kita</malay> why we sitting here
(uh huh)
nice I mean at least better than Smiggle
ya why why would you even put like six cents
they say they want to increase my pay after like
whatever whatever but they didn't even do that
I'm so tired what the shit
okay I can't wait to watch my Netflix
<malay>aku semalam tak pergi sekolah</malay> [kan] I literally stay at home and watch #anime# ya
I watch #anime# then I watch this new K drama <malay>yang</malay> do you like #brams#
#brams# no
no no it's a it's a K drama about like classic music classical music (mm)
it's not bad [lah] I think next week [dah] <malay>habis</malay>
no actually K dramas [ah] korean drama they usually end after episode sixteen
the longest it'll be twenty six or like thirty eight
right right
(hmm)
that's me that's me when I watch scarlet heart #ryeo# I was so sad ya I mean like scarlet heart #ryeo# was more than twenty episode I think
I think like twenty five or something I think so [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay> I I wanted a season two
[oh] my god it was so good [kan] then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then !ee!
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
and technically the <malay>anak</malay> is a princess
I mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood [lah] because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner like commoner
<malay>dia punya</malay> sister the cousin-in-law is a princess then got married to another prince then after that she became like this the lady in charge of all the princess and the kings <malay>punya mandi mandi</malay> and stuff
ya you like the ya the head servant that kind and she became like that like a royal something [ah] can't remember
is a nice show
like I'm so sad
I heard they make a chinese version of it
I don't know but then chinese version <malay>ada</malay> season two
that is the thing
[kan] [oh] ya I saw
<malay>ya ke</malay>
(hmm) but then I feel like <malay>yang cina punya</malay>
drama the goals are [eh] like [meh]
like [eh] but then the case like korean dramas <malay>punya</malay> standard ya
[oh] you know I watch I recently watch this chinese drama my unicorn girl and then
the the lead actor was the guy from meteor garden
like the chinese the china chinese or china version I don't know [ah]
I think china version of meteor garden that are four
one of the guy is the lead actor of this drama I finish watching
<malay>habis macam</malay> handsome <malay>gila</malay> [sia] he's like my favourite actor [ah]
dylan I think his name is dylan dylan #chen#

<malay>kau pun sama</malay> I cannot say much about me
my jaw line is gone <malay>diam</malay> [ah] [sia]

ya like that [ah] because like they are old people I guess
but at least like the the food is nice ya it's cheap also I want to eat the fried mushroom
super nice
<malay>sedap</malay> [sia]
maybe but then it's small
i'm' not I'm not sure
but then right I heard like if you book the down town east the new down town east resort
staycation #thingy# ticket and the chalet you get free tickets for !wah! !wah! wet
ya and I want to go !wah! !wah! wet
ya but if you book you get free [sia]
I don't know I think hundred plus I remembered it depends on how how big you want the room to be the small the smaller room are like hundred plus per night or something like that it's quite cheap [ah] actually but I feel like it's not that worth it
because <malay>tempat dia pun kecil</malay> even at the two storey two storey room is small ya like when yo go inside the room right
you didn't have like toilet sofa balcony then you go up it's just the beds
ya so it's nothing much ya ya ya it's like it's like studio M but maybe slightly smaller I think because of the area and then more hipster
I wanna go cherry
so fun
[oh] my god I was so shook [sia]
and I felt so
guilty you know like I literally said sorry [eh] sorry [eh] I'm so sorry I'm so sorry about my friend they didn't even realise that then the malay malay bouncer said it's okay it's okay [dah] <malay>biasa selalu selalu macam gini</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] ya [sia]
literally <malay>terus aku tengok macam</malay> what the shit but thank god she she was wearing like

(mm) so she have to
so she had to like flip her
her shirt
(um) (mm)
she had to flip her shirt <malay>macam</malay> from the front to the back so that the back [one] was in front then the back the back stained [ah] stained yet
ya [sia] but okay [lah] she was drunk so
(mm)
(um) sure
three [oh] my god so so <malay>lambat</malay>
I don't think so
I don't think so because
because confirm she will ask me like why didn't you take an earlier shift and the she be like then how to go back like very logical
ya ya she be like !huh! why you
why you just cannot earlier shift
why you can't <malay>balik siang</malay>

(um) I would say like I'm not a baby anymore I can I will I am responsible and I can ensure that I will be safe <malay>nanti dia terus macam</malay> no [ah] as long as you live under my house you are my baby you stay my baby
[kan] asian moms okay [lah] it's not a bad thing [lah] but sometimes it is
ya
but one point eight K is too much [ah] honestly
(um) not bad what you have to consider you have to consider your <malay>gaji</malay> you have to consider how much you have to set aside for like is being cut for example your food your home utilities
but that's not possible for a graduate student like just finish schools kind of
ya [sia] I mean like the most we can get is two point two I mean like that's the standard diploma
salary I think
true but you have to work [lah]
why not you rent your at your brother's house
he has a room what and the child is small
she doesn't need her own room yet
I mean like you cannot live there for technically like for free free <malay>apa</malay> you have to help out also right
ya but you are still living in the same quarters
so you have to actually do a little bit of chores
why would you even do that
I can't wait for my sister to have her own house
I mean I think she has or maybe like she contacting somebody I don't know [oh] my god it's so annoying <malay>tengok besar</malay> [sia] this is my stomach
I'm a cow okay maybe this is
okay this is my stomach this is my stomach <malay>perut</malay> this is my <malay>babat</malay> this is like
<malay>sini</malay> this is my <malay>pusat</malay> this is my stomach I think this is my stomach

I will [lah] like
because I have once
I rebond my hair when my hair was pink and it wash of the pink colour and it became brown
because this is this is not permanent dye [what] ya ya and it was okay [lah] my hair was little bit tinted like pink but most of it was brown in year one I think the one that I did myself like you know the top dark thing or like purple pink
ya ya ya I after that I rebond
!huh! I was the prettiest
right
okay [lah] among my siblings who is the prettiest
how dare you
okay but among the three of us just straight forward tell me who [lah] !wow! I'm expecting to hear something else
what you mean last year this year <malay>pun apa haprak sangat ke</malay> this year okay [lah] maybe I gain weight
but then that that doesn't mean I'm not pretty that's what you trying to say because you say I ugly
ya but I wasn't exercising last year also not as much as year one
I think it's because of weight gain
my insecurities pop out

and diet but you get that's the thing that she did she diet she don't eat a lot during like
honestly I don't know
she didn't really starve [lah] I think she just I don't know she just eat lesser she don't eat dinner ya she only eat lunch
<malay>tak tahu</malay> apparently when she eat the TruFitz is it helps to curb her appetite
[kan]
and maybe because she maybe sometimes she eat dinner or like she <malay>minum air</malay> so it makes her full
but but it's true [ah] when you eat the TruFitz
<malay>kau takkan lapar</malay> because I ate that for like one week [what] and it does help !wah! I don't eat a lot in during lunch I don't eat a lot during dinner

so (uh) <malay>kita macam tak tak</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's no more energy to to [ah] to to expand to to argue [tau] <malay>macam</malay> at the most <malay>pun kalau</malay> even if we don't agree [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer [lah] you know it's just you know you just you just stop [lah] just you just don't don't don't speak [lah] but but it's something that I have always (um) like <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really thankful that (um) she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because (err) I I knew back then [eh] I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay [lah] you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because (err) <malay>dia pergi haji</malay> (uh) last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that (uh) she came back and (err) I think I don't know [lah] maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
and then after when she came back ya when she came back (err) she was more (err) you know (err) she was more more able to control herself [lah] her emotions [lah] and on my part also I try to I try to control my own emotions [lah]
ya
yes it's not a one size fits all kind of thing yes correct

so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this <malay>dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap</malay> I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience [lah] ya and then <malay>apa</malay>

yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya

yup yup yup
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang yang yang ni apa</malay> we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was (uh) the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time [kan] so you ask me to apply for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) opening [kan] <malay>yang yang</malay> ala air steward
ya (err) I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about (uh) I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like [eh] come [lah] just just follow me [lah] you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at <malay>dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>kat</malay> #yishun#
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area <malay>dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>dekat</malay> McDonald's and then <malay>kat luar</malay> and then we were talking about things like illuminati [lah] we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right (um) the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective [tau] which which means okay <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example [eh] I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand [tau] <malay>kenapa dia macam gitu</malay>
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective (uh) a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think (uh) it's quite it's it's something that (uh) there I I would I would (um) and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn [lah]
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so (err) and and and it was honestly right my mind [ah] is always a one track thing so let's say for example [kan] <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay I told myself [ah] I I want to become a pilot but (err) I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing [lah] so I I don't have that kind of (err) presence of mind [ah] to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
for me
[oh] right
so so my my life in in this industry [lah] in this aviation industry started out with (um) with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room (uh) on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion [lah] because he wanted to become a pilot himself <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> eyesight (err) <malay>macam tak</malay> (err) how to say [eh] (uh) not hundred percent [lah] not not not not a six six [lah] vision [lah] so (uh) and at that time [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> very strict [kan] <malay>kalau kau punya</malay> eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance <malay>dia lain</malay> [ah] [ah] [tau] yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right <malay>sebab tu</malay> [eh] they realise [eh] in (err) in (err) eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so <malay>dia orang</malay> (uh) they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot [tau] who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because <malay>dah tak boleh apa</malay> because you <malay>dah pakai</malay> you <malay>dah pakai</malay> glasses then that's that's it [lah] you you no more already [lah] no more chance right so [ah] so that was what spurt on my motivation (uh) and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in (uh) so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to (err) (err) start the flying course [ah] so that time (uh) they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents (uh) fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight <malay>macam</malay> familiarisation flight [ah] so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> then after that <malay>apa tu</malay> they they brief us and then (err) they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that [lah] this was a very long time ago <malay>sekarang dah takde lagi</malay> [tau]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition (uh) even further because I felt you know [ah] bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight <malay>dekat</malay> youth flying club [tau] and this was when I was sixteen [lah] when I was up there it was such a different feeling
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
[oh] definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet [lah] bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing [lah] that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that [lah] ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could <malay>tapi aku</malay> I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics <malay>macam</malay> science [ah] science <malay>punya</malay> subject [kan] (err) I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
(uh) it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time [ah] I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my (uh) my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so (uh) puzzled because <malay>did cakap apa</malay> [tau]
(uh) [eh] I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics [ah] but your other topics [ah] you <malay>rabak</malay> man you cannot make it why [ah] then I realise that but it was it was (uh) (uh) only way way way later [lah] then I realise that (uh) okay I I I actually
[ah] no no it was a academic (uh) more of a academic kind of (uh) mistake [lah] (uh) I mean it was a academic (um) how to say [ah] misstep which which I could have my my my (um) my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science [ah] which means then after that (err) the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was (uh) just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six [ah] I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit [ah] when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis [ah] so I had to remove my appendix because (err) it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had (err) not (err) what (err) gone to the hospital [lah] (uh) if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally <malay>aku tak boleh bergerak</malay> I was just I I and I still remember that day was my (uh) examination my english paper <malay>punya</malay> examination and (err) I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now [ah] okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication (uh) in which this this (uh) operation actually made my stomach lining weak
(uh) because they have to cut they have to cut through [mah] so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my (err) my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another [lah] basically so it was first it was an appendix then (uh) it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical [eh] in a medical sector your intestines (uh) usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
(uh) apparently that can be fixed okay (err) and and basically what happens is (uh) if you fix it (uh) generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
it recurred again ya it recurred again so (uh) that was another dent in my in my in my dreams [lah] basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know <malay>aku pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>punya</malay> air steward <malay>punya</malay> interview <malay>tu yang aku</malay> pass
(err) actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why <malay>aku tak aku tak dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>jadi</malay> (err) air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up [lah] how it all times ties back together
this this this this (uh) this condition but (um) the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and (uh) hopefully hopefully [lah] [ah] cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again [lah]
!huh! this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was (uh) in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is (err) (err) specifically flying related
so (uh) they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day (uh) but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying [lah]
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation <malay>aku pakai ni aku pakai</malay> my medisave (uh) my my <malay>apa tu orang panggil</malay>
(uh) I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid (uh) <malay>pakai</malay> insurance [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my medical insurance [ah] ya (err) for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
<malay>apa</malay> working
am I still what
in that in that in in in that [ah] [oh] debt (uh) I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
<malay>ada ada sikit sikit</malay>
<malay>ada ada sikit</malay> (uh) my mortgage [kan] every month is (uh) one point one K (uh) <malay>aku punya</malay> (err) they cut off <malay>aku punya</malay> (uh) eight hundred
so <malay>aku kena</malay> top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future [lah] <malay>aku aku aku</malay> I was thinking [lah] anyway that [one] is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me [lah] which is why I wanted a bigger place (uh) the other reason was because <malay>aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang</malay> [ah] all my baggage my
[eh] I don't mind man I really don't mind <malay>kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat</malay> it's just beside admiralty [jer] also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area [kan] and (uh) the it's only about <malay>macam</malay> five minutes
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay> it's not it's (uh) it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential <malay>punya punya</malay> place [ah]
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them (uh) [ah] no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate (uh) site I was actually doing (uh) business business aircraft when I was in the
yes I was there (uh) okay [lah] it was it was (uh) it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is (um) when you are overseas [eh] (err) your how do I put it [eh] you you're considered as an expat [tau] so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration [lah] so that's the reason why (um) most of us [kan] <malay>kita belajar kat sana</malay> we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to (uh) apply with the local <malay>punya</malay> okay so right now right now (err) so okay so so right now what happens is this [eh]
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
so (uh) average [lah] it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level [lah] I'm not I'm not a <malay>macam</malay> senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of (uh) about four K about there [lah] about about (uh) thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes so when COVID happened (err) this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad (err) I mean it was just a very bad timing [ah] it was the worst hit industry ever (uh) unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and (uh) they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old [lah] so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again [ah]
to the parts [ah] they get (uh) they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
(uh) some of them they do but most of them for the most part (err) they don't need right they just they juts leave them there [lah] they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there [ah] nobody wants to (uh) you know [ah] then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this [lah] you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be [lah]
[oh] man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of (uh) of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot [lah] this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was (uh) it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay [lah] so I thought it was (uh) it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did [lah] and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed <malay>kita dah</malay> sign contract <malay>kita dah</malay> sign #dok# we even we even (err) graduated <malay>kita semua dah</malay> celebrate [seh] we went out drinking I mean
[ah] <malay>tak tak tak tak tak</malay> I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks [lah] along the way there's you know there's <malay>ujian</malay> there's setbacks there's (uh)
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
ya I know right <malay>macam nasib kentang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before [lah] this phrase I know I know
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining [lah] you know in in every ya so <malay>aku</malay> I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to (uh) goes back on track and all that right (uh) I I'm pretty sure [lah] one day [lah] one day I (uh) you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it [lah]
but but for now (uh) I got the next best thing which is (uh) flying drones [lah]
[eh] it's a different skill set [lah] [sia] it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself (uh) being on the drone so when I see it I was like [oh] okay ya [lah] but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do (uh) (uh) that's relatable and that's (uh) you know but I think (uh) they they have already announced <malay>macam</malay> plans [lah] you know
(uh) they want to push us to become (uh) flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is (uh) back to normal again right (uh) I think you know hopefully [lah] hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] #dok# flight <malay>tak boleh</malay>
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers [eh]
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen [ah] but if that ever happens [ah] you will know why [ah] you know all about the history behind it [lah] you can tell people [oh] yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya [lah] yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know [oh] my goodness

why I scared to be bankrupt because I don't want to owe people money
[ah] but then a lot of things are restricted like you cannot (uh) apply for your own home you cannot invest
[ah] but if you're somebody with a home and if you are declared bankrupt then they will take away their home [what] no [meh] not true [eh] is it [oh] I didn't know I thought they will take why all your your earthly belongings and your possessions
(oo)
(oo) okay okay explain to me

but but like they will take away your assets [kan] don't they take away some of your assets how does it work
(uh huh)

okay
(mmhmm)
okay
I don't buy under my name
(uh huh)
(uh huh) okay
(oo) but wouldn't they be able to trace
because just because it's not under my name [lah] so if it's so so the thing is that if if let's say all these things are under my name then they can pull it away they can take it away
[ah] I see
(mm)
ya ya ya ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah] I see
(oo) I see but then what happens to the amount that I mean cannot recover the the the amount [eh]

(oo) (oo) (oo) yes yes yes yes
okay
(oo)
(oo)

so so it's not that you cannot get a job it's just that the jobs that you (uh) [ah] able to get are limited [lah] certain industries [ah]
(mm)
[ah] I see
ya ya ya I see I see okay okay
the system [lah] ya [lah] that's true
<malay>tapi</malay> if you will just the <malay>duit bunga</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang panggil duit bunga</malay> [eh] but you you still accumulate <malay>apa</malay>

I see I see
okay
two more minutes
[ah]
[ah]

okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
I definitely eat <malay>rendang</malay>
yes
cause
<malay>rendang</malay> actually that's a good question why <malay>tau</malay> because
I <malay>selalu makan rendang</malay>
when
<malay>hari raya</malay> but then <malay>mak mak</malay>
<malay>mak</malay> always <malay>masak</malay> like anytime she wants
so when she everytime <malay>masak</malay> I everytime <malay>makan</malay> and I love the taste of <malay>rendang</malay>
so I <malay>makan</malay> everyday [ah]
and like you know I have I've ever gone
<malay>dua bulan makan rendang</malay> straight
not really [ah]
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe <malay>petang makan</malay> with <malay>roti</malay> then <malay>malam makan dengan</malay> noodle
<malay>faham</malay>
yea
ya [lah] <malay>ketupat</malay> is the best [lah] definitely
you put <malay>serunding</malay> !oof!
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
!huh!
what
why
[oh] okay
actually <malay>kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan</malay> noodles and like
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
you had <malay>lemak cili api</malay> pasta
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle [what]
besides
you know the
#lanzhou# beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes !oof!
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah [oh] my god
you know just now
tender
<malay>sendu sendu apa</malay>
<malay>sedap je</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>pekat</malay>
<malay>sendu lain</malay> [lah]
<malay>sendu lain seru pun lain</malay>
but
the what reason
pettiest
(mm)
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
[oh] my god is that your
<malay>macam</malay> step know it all [ah]
<malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> the big shot [ah]
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
people <malay>yang</malay> ego
they are like
how I say [eh]
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no [lah] I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
so <malay>macam</malay>
I just can't stand <malay>kalau orang nak macam nak</malay> step <malay>besar</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> step <malay>orang yang nak</malay> step I really just cannot
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion [ah] <malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion
ya so like
(uh) actually
more better <malay>lebih baik</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay>
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
[ah] this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
then <malay>hidup tak ada</malay> objective
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> ya because for example if someone
right now in the world when there are doctors especially this kind of (uh) jobs doctors so if no they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah (uh) that should be my answer but if
work in terms of because <malay>orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu</malay>
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so <malay>macam buang masa</malay> [ah] <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
that's what I feel [lah] because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on on the fence [ah] on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
(mmhmm)
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed <malay>banyak banyak</malay> industry he <malay>dah masuk</malay> he fail <malay>banyak</malay>
but then
at forty two [eh] forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
and then after the <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>buat</malay> the apprenticeship <malay>dengan</malay> tattoo artist <malay>dia buka kedai dia sendiri</malay>
at forty five and <malay>kedai dia</malay> successful
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but (uh)
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at [ah]
(mmhmm)
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
(mmhmm) but the moral is don't give up [ah]
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
you <malay>rasa</malay> you
<malay>dah puas</malay> with the thing you <malay>buat</malay> [kan]
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
if not <malay>sampai bila bila pun kan</malay> you <malay>tak akan</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> that this is the life that I want
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said [ah] everything you explore
on after the next day
all that thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> explore remain inside your body
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at [lah]
(mmhmm)
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
!wow! okay
okay
that's the first wish [eh]
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this [one] it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
(um)
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff <malay>kan</malay> you know I did all traditional stuff
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
and <malay>susah untuk kita nak</malay>
<malay>ubah pikiran orang</malay>
yes
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
that society <malay>punya ape tu</malay> what do you call it requirement
the society's
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
[oh] yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like [oh] my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
(mmhmm)
I mean
that's good for you [lah] because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me [ah] I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
<malay>apa</malay>
yeah you go first [ah] I <malay>tak tahu apa nak</malay>
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook [oh]
why didn't you take culinary [eh]
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
[oh] okay
because <malay>melayu</malay> always <malay>masak with agak agak</malay>
so it's nice when it's <malay>agak agak</malay>
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
(hmm)
yeah
precisely what I what I I said [lah] it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
I want the <malay>rendang</malay> italian
italian
<malay>rendang</malay>
<malay>rendang</malay>
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay [ah] what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it

iphone eleven <malay>dalam</malay> one thousand plus [ah]
so if <malay>kalau tambah</malay> plus <malay>atau yang</malay> [eh] sorry iphone pro [eh] iphone pro <malay>dengan</malay> iphone pro max
<malay>yang tu kena</malay> check <malay>dulu</malay> like <malay>dia punya harga berapa</malay>
ya
the same
have you checked
[oh] so I think <malay>tengok tempat dia</malay> plan [jer] [lah] <malay>tengok macam mana dia punya</malay> plan <malay>dia berapa</malay> gigabyte
<malay>berapa</malay> incoming call free <malay>semua</malay> like
<malay>dia punya</malay> specs [ah]
(hmm) <malay>tengok</malay> benefit benefit <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] okay
ten gigabyte [kan] per month okay
but currently you use what phone currently <malay>pakai</malay> phone <malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
ya ya
(uh)
ya ya our <malay>saudara</malay>
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years [eh] but I think you just bought [kan] iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade [eh]
[oh] still iphone [lah]
[oh] but I think recently you bought [kan] a new phone
!alamak! drill [ah] <malay>buto</malay> sorry sorry pause
<malay>yang</malay> iphone eleven <malay>tu</malay> (uh) you plan to take which plan
[oh]
ya
unless you have wifi [lah] at home you already have wifi [kan] or
ya
ya
<malay>tu</malay> full price [ah] no contract [ah]
[oh] actually iphone seven also not bad <malay>tapi</malay> I I would suggest iphone eight [ah] because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone [ah]
I think <malay>tu paling terbaik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan</malay> iphone eleven is really good enough [ah]
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
ya so that one that time was during COVID [kan] so <malay>sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> COVID [kan] so not to get more consumer to buy the phone [lah] at a cheaper price ya
even [ah] android phone <malay>pun sama</malay> [lah] like google the new google <malay>apa</malay> pixel [kan] they they make it cheaper [lah] but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit <malay>kurang</malay> [lah] compared to the previous one ya
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
must check the new iphone right <malay>jap</malay> [eh] let me check [eh]
there's about four point seven inch
it has a better bionic chip the <malay>apa</malay> it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition [ah] I don't think so
ya they are still selling I mean (um) you must check you must check <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>ustaz tengah</malay> check
<malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>ustaz kena</malay> check <malay>dia punya</malay> iphone <malay>punya</malay> iphone store
let me check
there's no more [ah] sorry they don't sell anymore [ah] iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven [lah] so I think for camera wise if you love the camera [kan] take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough [ah] iphone eleven (uh)
not too sure [ah] cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven [ah]
iphone X [eh] iphone X <malay>jap jap jap</malay> there's a face iphone
ya !alamak!
who
[oh] our <malay>ni</malay> [eh] parents [eh]
I think <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] mum is sleeping then I think <malay>bapak</malay> baru balik ya and
<malay>siapa</malay>
[ah] <malay>bapak kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>dekat ni</malay> [lah] <malay>iya dia kerja ni</malay> [lah] <malay>hari ni kerja</malay> [pe] <malay>hari ni hari rabu</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think he working three times a week
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off [ah]
I'm not really looking to job search yet [ah] cause I'm doing freelance [ah] so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year [lah] I try to finish this projects and without expecting much [lah] I think I think the most important thing is experience [ah] and the skills that I will acquire ya
<malay>tu</malay> I think <malay>paling penting</malay> [ah] so like <malay>macam nanti</malay> (um) once I've started working
once I start working [ah] I'm more prepared [ah] prepared than ever
<malay>kalau tak nanti macam</malay> before this <malay>kerja macam tak</malay> prepare <malay>sangat setakat apa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> relax relax <malay>tapi nanti</malay> end up <malay>macam tak belajar apa-apa macam</malay> cause
I think it's a bit hard [ah] because once you already
<malay>apa</malay> start started working [kan] you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing [kan] so you need to
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test [ah] they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills [ah] you have the knowledge
for coding [ah] ya so basically it's not that hard [lah] because really we can just (uh) search up in the in the <malay>apa</malay>
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
[ah] ya
ya ya some some some <malay>apa</malay> some company [kan] they
they know [ah] whether you you've you search online <malay>ke tak</malay> [lah] cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important [ah] it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
and they will ask you like on the spot [lah] like how do you solve this [ah] [ah] this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem [lah] I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is (uh) that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them [lah]
ya
it's more mostly interview skills [lah] that
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice [ah] you need to really improve on it [ah] then you have higher chance to to be <malay>apa</malay> to be offered [lah] by the company
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
[ah] monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast [ah] (mm)
the expected
[oh]
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you [lah]
[oh]
<malay>jangan kena pijak</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
[oh] okay okay
ya
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> like looking into like contract or <malay>apa</malay>
(uh) full time <malay>ke</malay> part time
ya
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> full time <malay>pun</malay> there's a lot of expectation [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
[oh]
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay> N level start <malay>sama</malay> time [eh] <malay>dengan</malay> O level
[oh] okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
<malay>tapi</malay> [ah] the
ya <malay>tapi</malay> the condition <malay>sekarang</malay> condition <malay>sekarang macam mana dia punya</malay> COVID <malay>dia orang ambil</malay> O level december <malay>apa</malay> this COVID <malay>kat</malay>
[ah] the
<malay>tempat dekat rumah ke dekat examination hall</malay>
ya
(mmhmm)
but <malay>dia orang ambil</malay> same timing <malay>dia orang ada</malay> own shift <malay>ke apa atau</malay> it's just one time
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
microsoft office [ah]
okay okay
[oh] ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed [ah]
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is (uh) I think
[oh]
(mm)
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically [ah] system engineer [lah] you are looking to that position <malay>atau</malay> you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [lah]
ya over work [ah]
ya
ya
yup understood
<malay>ada macam macam</malay>
software engineer <malay>ke</malay> if
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding [kan] they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable [lah] you can still read the code [ah] like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
<malay>macam mana nak</malay> spell F O R T L A N
[oh] okay okay [eh] never heard before [eh]
even though I am a computer science
C hash [eh]
I think it's called C sharp [ah]
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before [lah] during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know [lah] this kind of
<malay>apa</malay> skills [ah] like
mostly low level [lah] like C sharp python [eh] sorry C sharp (uh) what is it called [ah] ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable [ah] than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
for example <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay name like
I think it's like flutter <malay>dia ada</malay> own language which which covered dart [eh] dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is <malay>apa</malay> go golang [eh] golang
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
like owned by google [ah] so they they have their own language they make their own <malay>ni</malay> designed by them
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing [ah] more structured
ya
(mm)
how do you spell logs
[oh] log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya ya
ya
ya
ya
I think
<malay>yang tengah</malay> [ah] <malay>siapa yang tekan biasanya</malay> the manager [kan] the <malay>apa</malay> (uh) the business <malay>punya</malay> side the project manager <malay>dia orang akan tekan</malay> [kan] this <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>faham faham</malay>
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya nobody use [eh]
[oh]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but each country like they have their own server <malay>ke atau</malay> they have their own
means like singapore have one server so <malay>lain negeri ada</malay> their own server <malay>ke</malay>
atau combine <malay>macam</malay> asia
[oh]
[oh] okay
<malay>abeh</malay> sekarang like [ah]
like
you know <malay>macam</malay> COVID <malay>pun</malay> is getting better [kan] singapore
malaysia <malay>pun</malay> like they they do open the border [kan] to singapore [kan] <malay>macam</malay> only for those <malay>yang</malay> business
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] green lane <malay>semua</malay>
so for the purpose of those <malay>yang ada rumah kat sana</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> ya for us I think we can't [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> we are going there basically <malay>nak apa</malay>
<malay>nak cuti</malay> [kan]
actually <malay>boleh balik</malay> [ah] because technically she is <malay>ni</malay> [kan] she is not singaporean [kan]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
actually I'm not sure like our cousin <malay>yang</malay> always (uh) who are staying there [kan] who are staying there #syakilah# #iman# do they <malay>dia orang boleh datang sini ke</malay>
unless <malay>dia orang ada</malay> they <malay>ada kerja dekat sini</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang ada kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>atau rumah kat sini</malay> [kan]
#clementi# house

(uh) the rice and
<malay>kuah apa kari</malay> [ah] <malay>kuah kari</malay> and I just cook <malay>telur sikit</malay> then <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah]
I think I need to start learn I need to start to learn cooking [ah]
but it's a bit hard ya it's a bit hard
I prefer to cook alone [ah]
ya
[ah] that one the smell <malay>nanti apa</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>bau dia</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti tu</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti iya</malay> [lah] <malay>tutup tingkap</malay>
<malay>tutup pintu semua</malay>
but I know [ah] I know how to cook <malay>macam</malay> like simple simple [ah] like usually I cook thai food [ah] sweet and sour fish
and #kai lan# <malay>ikan masin</malay>
baby #kai lan# <malay>ikan masin</malay> so <malay>macam setakat ikut ni</malay> [ah] <malay>ikut</malay> youtube and
ya <malay>kadang-kadang beli kat ni</malay> fairprice
nearby [lah]
giant so just <malay>beli apa</malay>
<malay>barang-barang semua dekat ni</malay> [ah] <malay>barang-barang kat</malay> giant and fairprice
<malay>kalau ada takde</malay> [ah] just find a replacement [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
that time <malay>takde ikan apa</malay> [eh] <malay>ikan tenggiri ke apa</malay> [eh]
so (uh) I replaced it with <malay>ikan apa nama dia</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin</malay> [ah] <malay>macam ketul-ketul macam</malay> cube <malay>ikan</malay> cube
throw the like it's just
simple [lah] <malay>dia punya masak</malay> it's not that hard [ah] just <malay>ikut dia punya</malay> youtube <malay>punya</malay> tutorial
ya not much
[ah] boneless and <malay>dia macam</malay> I think it's dried [ah] dried food dried fish
ya <malay>macam</malay> you you <malay>macam</malay> very dried [lah] <malay>dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat</malay>
ya it's not in the fridge [ah] it's like dried [ah] dried #ikan bilis#
ya so <malay>macam</malay> like it's in terms in the form of cube [ah] cube then with that cube just [ah] <malay>letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu</malay>
once the the fish <malay>dah tu</malay> [kan]
<malay>dah lembut</malay> [ah] <malay>baru tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak</malay> baby #kai lan#
<malay>letak kicap</malay> oyster sauce so once <malay>dah</malay>
<malay>dah panaskan</malay> I think like
five to ten minutes <malay>dah siap</malay>
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome [ah] <malay>kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa</malay> make sure <malay>letak dengan tepung</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> sauce <malay>senang nak buat</malay> [ah] sweet and sour sauce
ya
ya you you need to get the fish ya fried first [ah]
<malay>dengan tepung</malay>
ya
it's homemade [ah] homemade ya
ya
ya capsicum
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] I think this is like the starting point [ah] <malay>cuma macam</malay> <malay>nak</malay> I think I took me awhile [ah] like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring <malay>macam</malay> you need to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>potong ni</malay> [lah]
I think the
ya true [ah] <malay>barang-barang dah siap</malay> if someone already did that for me [kan] <malay>senang</malay> [ah] I think my life will be easier
<malay>cuma itulah</malay> you need
ya
but also maid also it's not that cheap [ah]
cannot cannot like that [ah] I think most women nowadays is they prefer to work [ah] [kan] but depends [ah] [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so take turn [ah]
[oh]
<malay>tapi boleh ke macam tu</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada</malay> agreement <malay>dia</malay> is just one house [kan] the maid
the agreement <malay>biasanya</malay> one maid <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay> one house [kan]
okay
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] of course
ya for weekend [ah]
ya usually once a week [kan] like sunday
[ah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
pause <malay>jap</malay> [eh] pause <malay>jap</malay>
but if the maid <malay>macam</malay> they have their own <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>kerja</malay> timing <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
like
ya sunday off
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day [kan] except <malay>malam</malay> [ah] [kan]
ya
<malay>dah berumur</malay> ya
ya of course
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> fairprice fairprice fairprice <malay>punya</malay> online
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] sometimes I think
that time I saw like <malay>macam halal punya daging</malay> [kan]
ya really <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> which section [eh] the section <malay>yang ada</malay> frozen food
ya it's similar [ah] same as when you go to grocery
ya
actually I saw this youtube video [ah] very interesting <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>punya</malay> shopping
<malay>tapi</malay> I don't think singapore <malay>ada</malay> [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> like I think in america <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] which country <malay>atau</malay> china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop [kan] there'll be someone who welcome you <malay>pastu</malay> [ah] you using the [lah] I think it's a like the device [ah] you need to buy the device device
then you are like it's like shopping [ah]
[ah] it's a virtual [ah] everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real [ah] I mean impossible [ah] but its similar [lah] it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
if if <malay>memang</malay> ya stock finish of course the thing is empty [lah] <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [ah]
it's the same as you are shopping [ah] it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually [lah]
ya very interesting
<malay>tapi</malay> it's very hard [ah] like I mean the software wise like
ya I think like imagine like walking [ah]
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab [kan]
why
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
access to shopping mall [eh] is it
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally [ah] I'm not too sure [ah] there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before [ah] I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
<malay>berapa</malay>
of course [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> price <malay>mahalnya</malay> it's like you're playing four <malay>punya</malay> <malay>punya tu</malay> [kan] console
(mm)
ya
but I think can be solved [ah] like technology wise <malay>macam</malay> they keep changing [kan] most like it's probably [ah] I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change [ah] <malay>macam</malay> in terms of like the new normal
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
like <malay>dulu takde</malay> [kan] I think previously my company my former company <malay>dia pernah</malay> offer [ah] work from anywhere so one year <malay>macam</malay> they give like seven days [ah]
ya
<malay>kat rumah</malay> [lah] you can can stay at home or go overseas <malay>apa</malay>

the manager will ask [ah] like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint [ah] sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya

[ah] but I not too sure [ah] like I heard from the news ya and they were hiring [ah] (mm) I think a lot foreigner [ah]
[oh] ikea [ah] I don't I don't think so actually I don't buy like
<malay>macam</malay> container [ah] <malay>nak letak</malay> something container like small [one] [ah] ya but I think [ah]

ya they make
one one table [kan] like ya seat of four or seat of two
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those <malay>yang</malay> one person [kan] they will sit at the seat of four <malay>kan nanti macam</malay> they don't <malay>apa</malay> utilise the space [ah] they don't make use of the space
then end up <malay>macam</malay> the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> weekend [kan] in #tampines# [kan]

ya
(mmhmm)
ambassador
ya
[ah] true [ah]
I think just make sure like everyone just follow [ah] cause now nowadays people like
ya [lah] you see like in at <malay>apa</malay> shopping mall like it's those crowded [kan] nowadays <malay>macam susah nak</malay> control [ah]
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya I think they will just monitor [lah] this <malay>apa</malay> maybe there's someone
watching the <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> detect
ya
check out [lah] don't check out [lah] ya it's very difficult to <malay>ni</malay>
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible [lah] just that location wise is a bit some [ah] some ya ya true [ah] some some [ah] some might be insecure a bit [ah] like
to be in track [kan]
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
about I think regarding the the battery [lah] <malay>dia cepat habis</malay> [ah]
ya definitely [ah] bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running [ah] it will still run ya because it need to keep checking [kan]
like the the nearby devices [kan] <malay>siapa yang</malay>
I'm not too sure [ah] I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise [ah] so I think they need like support of
(um) google and apple [kan] to <malay>ni</malay> with the android <malay>dengan</malay> phone
I think so [ah] I think it's just the bluetooth [ah] like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device [kan]
ya this is not this is not easy [ah] because because I think they still updates [ah] they're still updating they are still improving
for apple [kan] and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone [kan]
or you still stick with <malay>ni</malay>
Google
[oh]
android
(mm)
[oh] google home ya
ya
ya
who
google home okay
ya
(mmhmm)
yup correct
ya
[ah] ya ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
I think so [ah]
I think this is still depends cause google home [kan] they detect <malay>ni</malay> [kan] the surrounding [kan]
the microphone is how far
<malay>berapa jauh</malay>
as long as <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] microphone <malay>dengan</malay> I mean <malay>dia punya</malay> google home [kan] <malay>ada</malay> microphone [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
I'm not too sure [ah] like like what will be the reply like [ah] <malay>macam</malay> default like
[ah] there's something
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya maybe [ah] maybe ya ya the default <malay>punya</malay> default
[oh] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> offline data [lah] persistent storage [ah]
ya
maybe you can try like alexa <malay>ke</malay>
like
ya amazon products
ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
<malay>tapi</malay> but then it just think of us like their <malay>lagipun</malay> singapore is moving into smart nation [kan] so at certain points at certain [ah] zone for example I think #punggol# <malay>ke</malay> #sengkang# [eh]
like #punggol# [kan] there's there's a lot of flat [kan] so I think these flats <malay>dia orang ada</malay> their own smart <malay>punya apa</malay> devices [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart [lah] basically so <malay>bila macam masuk bilik</malay>
I think not too sure [ah] like they have their own ya they have their own brand [ah] I'm not not sure what brand is that [ah]
maybe maybe they collaborate (hmm)
I think there might be [lah] not too sure like
for example smart light you enter a room [kan] <malay>nanti dia macam</malay> the intensity <malay>akan</malay> increase [ah]
as we walk into <malay>macam tu</malay> example [jer] [lah]
so <malay>tak payah tekan butang ke apa</malay>
I think they have [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya <malay>macam ada</malay> sensor [kan]
[ah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house [ah] like or what like
ya
ya because
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country [kan] <malay>dia kat</malay> india [eh]
they use leg
<malay>pakai kaki untuk tekan butang dia</malay>
[ah] pedal pedal ya so they have to use
(uh) our hand [lah] our hand to press the button
ya there's some country use that [ah] <malay>macam</malay> pedal <malay>ke apa</malay>
ya
I think in singapore <malay>ada</malay> some building [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> like if inside the lift <malay>takde</malay> button
only <malay>kat luar</malay> [jer]
#paya lebar# ya I saw I went to #paya lebar#
[oh]
ya ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya ya ya

K
<malay>hari kita nak berbual pasal</malay>
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one [lah]
so I think you can start first [ah]
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
those abilities like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] kinaesthetic
[ah] kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility [ah]
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective [lah]
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you want to be superman <malay>atau pun nak jadi</malay>
batman
[oh] bat sorry batman or iron man okay <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> batman or iron man I would also want a superpower <malay>yang</malay>
can help others
but like for me is basically
[oh] so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
(mm) <malay>dia bukan dia bukan</malay> specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
[ah] so for me [oh] ya teleporting [eh] didn't actually come across my mind until <malay>tadi sebut</malay> teleporting
(mm) [ah]
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
any place of the world you [tau] <malay>macam</malay> harry potter
harry potter there's this
(err) magic spell I forgot [lah] <malay>apa</malay> magic spell [ah]
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot [lah] what's the the magic spell
(mm) [ah] disapparate [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age [ah]
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing (err) port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish (err) irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
goblet of fire cedric diggory <malay>yang ada siapa tu yang</malay> handsome <malay>tu nama dia</malay> [ah]
robert pattinson
ya that [one]
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers [ah] wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
[ah] if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like <malay>macam</malay> switch on and off
K but maybe
[ah] specifically to children [ah] because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard [ah]
like
<malay>budak-budak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kadang-kadang budak-budak pun kita</malay>
<malay>tak faham apa yang dia nak</malay>
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
for me to <malay>macam tahu</malay> what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I think also works for [ah]
adults [ah]
(um) but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
I do not want <malay>macam</malay> to be burdened
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> on and off [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya [lah] but
the thing is on and off [lah] I think every superpower <malay>ada</malay> burdensome
telepathy [ah] [eh] sorry <malay>apa</malay>
teleportation [ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
but it saves time it's very quick
<malay>cepat</malay>
(mm)
ya [ah] but the thing is
you are saving time
it depends [lah] whether you have more time the thing is people I think people <malay>nak</malay> this
teleportation
please [lah] don't cut me off [lah] the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this [lah] but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it [lah] [ah]
ya okay
so that's teleportation
(err)
(um) if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
<malay>macam kalau duit</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> definitely okay
ya
but money to me do it is not everything [ah]
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
[ah] your energy your smile and your
<malay>tolong orang</malay>
okay <malay>apa</malay>
superpower <malay>macam</malay> okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe [ah]
sorry occupational hazard K [ah] teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or <malay>jaga</malay> or <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak nangis datang kasi peluk</malay> to <malay>orang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> nothing [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son #aydin#
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
in the <malay>mata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
!wah! you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
(mm)
(mm)
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited [ah] okay
[orh]
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective [eh]
but what if <malay>naik lemak</malay>
like they <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay>
work hard themselves
they just expect to be given [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay> rich <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] work hard so we just wait for him <malay>apa</malay> to <malay>durian runtuh</malay>
okay
(mm)
okay
(err) but I okay [lah] maybe for you [kan]
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
it's something that you think of [lah] but I to me I think you know me as a person [kan] I'm not a person that wants unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
K
but I [oh] something came across my mind [lah]
ya I know it's just
a superpower
with unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
ya
(mm)
because [ah] okay the thing is something there <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that <malay>apa</malay> I respect it's just that I'm just
showing
the other side of ya
(mm)
okay
that's you were saying superpower
since you were saying superpower <malay>apa ni</malay> your superpower of unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
(mm)
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome [lah]
yes no the thing because I was thinking
if there's if that's if there is someone [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ubat</malay> for COVID nineteen like the perfect <malay>ubat</malay>
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study <malay>belajar macam mana</malay> like
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
[ah]
[ah] the bull's eye of medicine [ah] [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay>
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
free only <malay>untuk</malay>
K the thing is I think [kan] <malay>kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni</malay> [kan]
probably free depending on what type of <malay>ubat</malay>
but also
subsidised
(err) like singapore singapore doesn't give <malay>macam</malay> a lot of things <malay>percuma</malay> free
subsidised
then that [one] you have to talk to the experts [ah]
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
[ah] not everyone
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone <malay>betul tak</malay>
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
<malay>apa</malay> you your superpower that you wanted was
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
knowledge you <malay>pun macam</malay> [meh] (uh) <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
okay so
[eh] so that's about superpower [lah]
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
<malay>macam kena gaya</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> my personality [lah]
[ah]
or do you want to give me a superhero that <malay>macam sama dengan</malay> I wonder woman
or because I can
that is just [lah]
(mm) wonder woman [eh]
is okay wonder
okay can I I I will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
wonder woman is just <malay>macam</malay> too feminist [ah]
ya
ya [lah]
so but she can do [oh] she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
<malay>cakap bohong</malay>
about wonder
[orh]
okay
about wonder woman <malay>agaknya macam</malay> most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
<malay>tua</malay>
<malay>dia selalu sama umur habis ke</malay>
ya <malay>lambat gila</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai</malay> <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
she had to watch her <malay>kekasih</malay> die
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
[oh] it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
[eh] then that's boring man
[eh] but they are supposed to
I think they will filming [ah] <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> stop <malay>pasal</malay> COVID nineteen [kan]
[oh] <malay>dah habis filem dengan</malay> production [eh]
[oh] because of COVID nineteen then <malay>tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok</malay> [oh]

[ah] your eyes tell <malay>dia punya</malay> movie is <malay>pasal</malay> is a [ah] japanese movie [lah] so <malay>kita dia punya cerita sedih gila</malay>
so like
I don't know I was just like <malay>tengah nangis-nangis rabak</malay> [lah] but then the <malay>cerita</malay> is about like <malay>satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta</malay> temporarily
and after that
ya like <malay>tak buta mata</malay> [lah] because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
<malay>macam dekat</malay> part of the story was like the guy that <malay>dia suka</malay> or like <malay>macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta</malay> [kan]
it's actually it was was one of the reason why <malay>dia buta</malay>
ya [ah] because of like when he got when she got into an accident the <malay>lelaki tu macam buat benda yang</malay> like
<malay>tak tak</malay> supposed to <malay>buat</malay> [lah] because you know you know
[ah] then after that like it lead her to <malay>macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu</malay>
then <malay>yang paling sedih</malay> part is actually like <malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>perempuan tu kena</malay> undergo surgery [kan] <malay>pasal boleh</malay> actually <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>rawat</malay> [lah] like <malay>boleh</malay> get better so that guy <malay>pasal</malay> that guy <malay>macam</malay> very poor <malay>tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam</malay> you know
<malay>kerja cara</malay> wrestling <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>kerja untuk</malay> like because they <malay>macam</malay> [ah] couple [what]
so like that guy <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>kerja sampai dapat duit untuk</malay> undergo for that girl to undergo surgery [ah]
then after and then after that <malay>bila</malay> like (uh)
ya so because of that rant <malay>dia bagi</malay> like <malay>duit</malay> to undergo surgery then when the surgery <malay>tu</malay> was successful
<malay>dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu</malay> [lah] because he doesn't want to like
<malay>sakitkan hati perempuan tu</malay>
and after that <malay>yang</malay> part <malay>sedih</malay> was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
so actually she was he was
<malay>dia macam</malay> contact later like contemplating whether he should <malay>jumpa perempuan tu balik</malay> or like
<malay>tinggalkan</malay> so <malay>bila</malay> part like
<malay>bila</malay> part <malay>dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena</malay> stabbed
behind
from like this like bad people because <malay>dia dulu kerja memang jahat</malay>
then after that <malay>dia kena</malay> coma for two years [ah]
<malay>lelaki tu kena</malay> coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital <malay>macam orang jaga</malay> then that girl was one of the volunteer
and after that like then after that
you know the thing is like <malay>bila</malay> coma so he cannot talk [what]
so when her ya then ya
[ah] that's japanese <malay>punya</malay> movie [lah] but then <malay>bila</malay> like <malay>sekarang</malay> hospital <malay>tu</malay> then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then <malay>perempuan tu macam</malay>
<malay>apa ni</malay> like
like like is he okay
then like he alleged actually before that he also <malay>macam buat</malay> sculpture
ceramic so he before that <malay>macam</malay> when <malay>dia buta</malay> he she felt the <malay>lelaki muka</malay> [ah]
so and then after that (uh) I think <malay>macam</malay> there was one this music box <malay>yang</malay> reminded of both of them
then after that (err) she own a shop like after she was like okay that she have a eyesight back [ah]
then after that when
one of the <malay>pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang</malay> there's this guy who came in the
<malay>apa kedai</malay>
crying while listening to music box <malay>terus dia tahu</malay> [ah] that was like the last part <malay>terus dia tahu yang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> it was the guy that
he she fell in love with [ah]
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy <malay>kata</malay> (um) you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad [ah] <malay>sedih gila</malay> and after that ya me and <malay>abang</malay> was like <malay>tengah</malay> teared out already then the whole cinema <malay>tengah nangis gila kelakar gila</malay> [seh]
ya it was like really funny but it's like so sad I don't know to me is like sad
but the ending

but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like <malay>mat salleh</malay>
and then ya cause of the circuit breaker you know cause of the circuit breaker [lah] I don't know why like I suddenly like got like interested and I still remember like few years ago was like I'm not going to like
get into this K pop style of thing it's like
I will not then after that suddenly like this year look at me now
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and <malay>kakak</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> also like watch everyday like at the
and then like at first at first I got like
interested in K drama then after that suddenly now I'm like into K pop [ah] ya I mean
now ya
[eh] but then like thankfully like <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>bapa</malay> is like
they don't really care
no because no that time that time I went home and then
that time I came back home then <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>ibu</malay> was like (um)
what is what is that like at your drawer so <malay>berlambak</malay> album then I'm like what am I supposed to say I thought she was going to scold me then I I was like [ah] <malay>tu</malay> album [ah] then she was like [ah] <malay>duit</malay> birthday <malay>semua pakai</malay>
<malay>pakai beli</malay> album [jer]

I I <malay>beli</malay> like I bought there was like
I bought three album for eight dollar
ya that's so cheap then I'm like okay [lah] might as well then after that go like
my group just come back so I bought
a few only then I'm like I mean okay [lah] it's not that expensive so <malay>ni</malay> [lah] I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
[oh]
by the way right then this past few days two weeks
I've been going to like cafe events I told you that
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits <malay>dekat</malay>
I don't know where is it but I's near #bencoolen# and it's like [oh] my god like I would like recommend go there like it's ten out of ten to me it's like
the place is so aesthetic
like the place you really like very nice it's built nice then it's like the food is good
and I also like the event was like fun I just had like I had a really good time that day that day ya I mean there's like three places I've went one is like #oma# spoon
<malay>dekat</malay> somerset
it's like #bingsoo# then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe <malay>dekat dengan</malay>
[ah] #dhoby ghaut# there
but then to me like the best is gather the misfits [ah] cause like this like plus eighty two cafe is like very plain but if you see if you go to the gather the misfits right it's cool you know they got like the fan art thing at the cappuccino something there made
ya and also like
ya and to me like those type of cafes I actually expected to like <malay>lebih mahal</malay>
I thought it will be like twenty dollars or fifteen dollar for just a waffle like waffle like sometimes
no but like I went to like #haji lane# before then
ya [lah] so I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be like that but then the waffles are only like seven dollars so it was like affordable to me [lah]
it's not bad the drinks also like okay I see that
no it's not it's near
I forgot what is it called farrer road farrer park is like near the blue line there I don't know what but you have to walk for seven minutes
ya but then the place is like
I don't think like a lot of people know because it's like
around there is like factory something like that [ah] like it's not like
[tau]
it's not it's not like that it's not near town all that so I guess a lot of people
ya
I want then after that I look at the the plus eighty two cafe right then their event like damn boring then I'm like then then I got like a bit motivated I'm like [eh] maybe in the future right I want to like
I'll open my own cafe
ya [lah] maybe maybe maybe like I don't like
bake and all but I would like open a cafe maybe like in the future with my friend
but then my friend would do like all the baking then I'll just like interior the like design
no [lah] like just interior design like design the place and like maybe do like some admin stuff about it
but then like it's I don't know it looks interesting like if I want to like
start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very <malay>mahal</malay> like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
it's like you know like
it's ya
ya
[a'ah] then <malay>kau kalau</malay> also need to promote then what if like <malay>orang</malay> don't want to come so
ya but then like I like those like aesthetic type of cafes like
cool
<malay>tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap</malay> then that was the problem fit in the cafe
[ah] they just go there to take picture <malay>ambil gambar</malay> aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two <malay>punya ni</malay> like
to me the americano sucks
like it taste sucks man
I don't know maybe I'm just not like coffee type of person [oh] no I don't like bitter bitter stuff so I guess coffee you know like I can drink like coffee much annoy cannot even say ya like the other good [leh] it's like

bro <malay>aku</malay> #frus# [ah] bro
what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game <malay>aku punya bingit</malay> which man U game the one with crystal palace [ah]
ya (err)
K K K admittedly <malay>macam macam budak-budak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam main dengan</malay> boy look look at look at #wilfried# freaking #zaha# what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
no thanks to david #moyes# we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back (um) bit our hand back
<malay>geram</malay> [seh] then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about #gareth bale# and #sergio aguero# and and #thiago#
and you associated with all of them
but [oh] look <malay>dia pun</malay> sign the only work
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya [ah] the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about #thiago# he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in #barcelona# central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database <malay>pakai</malay> football manager <malay>semak</malay>
I can't believe [sia]
david #moyes# <malay>kat mana dia baru lawan</malay> #arteta# last week
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham [a'ah]
when did they ever not lost okay [ah] to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean [ah] but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
#arteta#
plus minus [ah] plus minus [ah]
[eh] but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna <malay>angkat</malay> again [ah] the <malay>korang punya</malay> the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular #thiago#
<malay>dia punya</malay>
he knows his a level above everybody else [ah] no but but K you know there's this two theories of
(err) two types of players football theory [eh] two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers [kan]
[ah] the likes of
#guardiola#
and #pochettino# and #martinez# and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis #van gaal# [ah] #ajax# school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis #van gaal# is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but (err) no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective [ah] okay (err)
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent [ah]
he does basically [ah]
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen [ah] in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis #van gaal# school of control
wait then then I have the flip side [ah] the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually #merino# takes everything that is strong about louis #van gaal# and finds the witnesses so like louis #van gaal# takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using #merino# flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing [ah]
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the #barcelona# against #inter milan# <malay>punya</malay> game [ah] #barcelona# [ah] [eh] sorry (um)
bionic #inter milan# game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but #inter milan# won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is (err)
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's #mourinho#
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin [ah]
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick #zambia lonso#
(err) (err) schools that kind of control #zavi iniesta# chaos player
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't #van gaal# doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone <malay>yang terus</malay> shoot the ball [tau]
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so (err) he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why #van gaal# and #cryuff# although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
#cryuff# emphasise more on individual creativity #van gaal# is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what #mourinho# exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
[ah] basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to <malay>kelam kabut</malay> he lose the ball there
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre [ah] #mourinho# he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
ya but #klopp# he he demands the intensity and that <malay>kelam kabut</malay>
opposites outside of the spectrum for one #klopp#
he
#klopp# denies his space
yes
correct for
swan

movies
okay

okay talking about children <malay>aku baru berbual dengan bini aku</malay> a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all netflix movies or shows for free

[ah] you can install on smart Android box
as long as it's Android it can be installed [ah] in other words whatever the physical shape
it's an [ah]
okay so <malay>bini aku</malay> past few days we're talking about this she mentioned this Netflix thing [tau] about how
(uh) in the last week or last few days <malay>alih-alih macam</malay>
their reporting
(err) people who are un-subscribing from Netflix are at an all time high
[ah] or
yes cause of the cuties it's cause (err) (err)
cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and <malay>apa</malay> okay [ah] to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing [ah] and <malay>kau kau tahu</malay> the controversy behind it
okay
alright so on on the surface level [eh] on the surface level is like [ah]
this de-sexualisation of minors [kan] <malay>selalunya</malay> I would say [kan] <malay>syaiton</malay> slowly <malay>syaiton</malay> is slowly inserting his influence on these things [ah]
desensitising us to sexualisation so
but (err) you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins <malay>budak-budak ni</malay> they are just
ten eleven years old [kan]
eleven years old not wearing [ah] so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
it's my niece [ah] ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world [tau] <malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] the fact that
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids [ah] and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences [eh]
and then you have the goal of the director <malay>nama dia macam</malay> sounds a muslim #maimunah# the cold or something <malay>dia dia dia macam</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] one of the subject people from france <malay>punya</malay> territories [ah]
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal <malay>ini</malay> [kan] but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like [oh] it's a coming of
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing [lah] that's the justification [ah] so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world [ah] mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people
<malay>aku nak tahu ni</malay> who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through <malay>budak-budak sebelas tahun macam</malay>
it's not a sleazy casting call [ah]
(mm) (mm)
kevin spacey serious
he's he plays like nerdy character <malay>macam</malay> he himself looks like
cut off like that [ah] controversial
better for him to keep his mouth shut rather than act moral
(mm)
(mm) (mm)

he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself [ah] [ah] to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am [kan] (uh) we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
he's not wrong per se which is not legally wrong <malay>tapi</malay> is
morally ambiguous [ah] but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging [tau] when you put yourself in and ask yourself
<malay>aku rasa</malay> three [ah] three three to four [ah] then (um)
then you see how brothers three each other and everything [ah] so <malay>kau dah tengok dia punya abang</malay> treat <malay>dia macam mana</malay>
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] it's a psychological phenomenon [ah] it's not a physical disability actually
ya in a fire self-immolation

safe entry
camera [ah]
no no no how I do my safe entry basically <malay>kalau</malay> let's say somewhere which I go often [eh] #tampines# mall
I scan one
I keep the browser open
I don't close I don't ever close that browser so the next time I come [ah] use that same old from maybe last week or something <malay>aku malas</malay> [sia] <malay>nak</malay> scan scan <malay>balik</malay> ya ya I breaking protocols here but ya that's how I do it
(mmhmm)
A level O level <malay>semua keluar</malay> [a'ah] okay
(mmhmm)
really
okay
(mmhmm)
which is which yours
okay [ah] so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
but <malay>apa</malay> double tap <malay>terus masuk</malay> camera mode <malay>apa</malay>
code <malay>keluar</malay> the camera app [ah]
why double tap when you can just press the camera app
<malay>aku</malay> press camera app I point it at the code
[a'ah] so why double tap can just <malay>masuk</malay> the app then
cause it's you double tap then you still have to press the thing right
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] I was thinking <malay>apa macam</malay> [sial] [ah] <malay>aku tengok</malay> is that a code <malay>jadi</malay> code to your address or
ya
so what's the <malay>ayat</malay>
so the start of the <malay>ayat</malay> start at the bottom
[oh] you go it goes in a clockwise
[ah]
(mm)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so where is
(oo)
ya ya ya ya ya ya
I I see what you did that you got <malay>ayatul kursi</malay> on
as long as
give me a good few suggestions [eh] [ah] my dad told me there's this good place <malay>dekat</malay> somewhere near the mushroom park opposite mushroom park
[a'ah]
[ah] it's not at mushroom park [tau] mushroom park is old #chang kee# <malay>punya</malay> run is it's a cafe run by old #chang kee# but it's apparently across (err)
I know it's across mushroom park <malay>atau</malay> across the stadium
anchorvale <malay>nya</malay>
what's vending machine cafe
I think so
[a'ah] it's cheap but you can't get anymore <malay>melayu</malay> then that [ah] [eh]
why
one corner
wait
wait so it it's not a good name cause there's no place to <malay>lepak</malay> or it's not a good name cause there's no corner for you to <malay>lepak</malay>
it's like the conundrum you how do you confused a <malay>mat</malay> you ask him you know put in a round room and ask me to <malay>lepak</malay> one corner
[oh] hawker centre
[a'ah] [a'ah] correct
(mmhmm)
so it's not the
[a'ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>kat mana</malay>
[oh] the cross across the <malay>simpang ini</malay> [kan] ya correct correct correct

right
can
[oh] okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
(err) this kind of thing you have to <malay>macam mak bapa</malay> [ah] then sometimes they will advise <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam orang tua</malay> they have their preferred (um) preferred <malay>kadi</malay> of choice <malay>macam</malay> they <malay>dorang</malay> have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi</malay> [ah] <malay>lembut cara dia berbual</malay> that kind of thing [lah] so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding (err) you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
your wedding date will be available then (um) you can
choose
[eh] I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically (err) when you
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you (err) <malay>boleh</malay> book [ah] then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of <malay>kadi</malay> available then all the <malay>kadi</malay> then they also show like where the <malay>kadi</malay> lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them [lah] basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>takut kadi</malay> (err) they wanted for morning morning wedding [kan] so <malay>dorangnya</malay> ceremony for the <malay>nikah pagi</malay> so <malay>dorang tak nak macam kadi takut</malay> jam so <malay>kalau katakan</malay> they wanted to have a eight
(um) ceremony [kan] then after that [oh] nine ceremony then <malay>katakan</malay> they scared [oh] if the <malay>kadi tinggal</malay> #pasir ris# then my ceremony is in #jurong# <malay>dorang takut kadi datang</malay> jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred (err) they don't have a preferred (err) <malay>kadi</malay> sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby [ah] so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the <malay>kadi punya tak</malay>
what's that called where he lives is also (err) stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just (um)
look at the <malay>kadi</malay> available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of <malay>kadi</malay> available you just choose [ah] say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the <malay>kadi</malay> who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this [one] you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that <malay>dah</malay> then you can <malay>boleh masuk</malay> and book the once your date is available you can go and book [lah]
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance [lah] ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
[oh] then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is [ah] amendment there is [ah] basically (um) when you choose (err) your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things [ah]
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the <malay>kadi</malay> available
and then after that <malay>macam</malay>
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to #lina# everything [kan] send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire (um) all the details so that (err) being a typical singaporean [ah] we #kiasu# [one] so (err) once (err) once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the <malay>kadi</malay> that I want but eventually on that day itself my <malay>kadi</malay> was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
(err) for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I (err) you can ask #lina# for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit <malay>macam tak sabar</malay> everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it <malay>kadi kadi</malay> I think there's only three or four
then everything else is <malay>naib kadi</malay> ya
ya is it ten is it [oh] okay
<malay>ni wali punya</malay> thing
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller [lah] basically
I don't think anybody does any <malay>kadi</malay> reviews last time of course [lah] ya
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay [ah]
(mmhmm) ya you don't want to you don't want to <malay>macam yang</malay> draggy draggy until <malay>macam kasi</malay> trauma that kind of thing [kan]
(mm) sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> the <malay>orang yang datang tak semua</malay> islam
you know [kan] that's that's one thing that for me also cause <malay>macam</malay> my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended (err) <malay>nikah</malay> ceremony with all the <malay>dua</malay> and everything with all the <malay>ceramah</malay> everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them [lah]
that's one thing also but
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good <malay>kadi</malay> but then sometimes you don't want someone who
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that [lah] but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
I think I think the okay when it comes to <malay>kadi</malay> they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
cause okay
put yourself in their shoes [lah] <malay>macam dorang</malay>
<malay>setiap minggu ada nikah</malay> to do
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like (err) like they're they're very busy [lah] so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
they will message you and then he will they usually the <malay>kadi</malay> will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
so included me and #alina#
why he did that was basically just to <malay>macam ingatkan</malay> (err) remind you to <malay>bawa</malay> your (err) <malay>bawa</malay> then documents that you need to bring [lah] basically and then (um) some time then (err) he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp [lah] he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I (um)
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say [lah] then I say <malay>tak</malay> [ah] (err) <malay>banyak</malay> members <malay>dah kahwin</malay> then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so <malay>macam apa nak cakap</malay> and everything all I got it down [lah]
no need to worry but for some of my friends some <malay>kadi</malay> will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya <malay>ke</malay> but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script [ah] (err) post post <malay>nikah</malay> ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in (err) like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to <malay>baku</malay> ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school <malay>macam kau</malay> primary school your oral have to be <malay>baku</malay> [kan] ya exactly
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different [lah]
okay so the initial the initial <malay>kadi</malay> that we chose (um) on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague [lah] basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before [lah] basically ya ya the <malay>kadi</malay> before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya (um) but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the <malay>kadi</malay> that you want and then set a date with
then <malay>turun</malay> [ah] <malay>turun</malay> (err) on whichever date that (err) you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the <malay>kadi</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] (err) <malay>tunang saya bapa bukan</malay> islam then <malay>dia tanya</malay> like things of like how what is what's (err) (um) [lah] what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit [lah] basically ya
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday [ah] you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you [oh] close the window
ya things like that [lah] but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
I wanted to get the <malay>kadi</malay> that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one <malay>kadi</malay> that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that <malay>macam</malay>
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so <malay>macam</malay> on the day itself if you need to do then [oh] <malay>semua dah siap</malay>
(um)
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot [lah] ya but for me it was I chose the [eh] no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
(um) I would say a lot of people <malay>nikah</malay> on saturday
a lot of people actually <malay>nikah</malay> on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate (err) double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married <malay>nikah</malay> on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
(um) ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different [ah] (mm) different [ah]
!wah! I don't remember whether there's any charges [eh]
<malay>tak ingat</malay>
okay okay
don't need [one] not necessary [ah] they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
<malay>nak kena faham</malay> I mean from their point of view is necessary [lah] for people to for couples to be <malay>macam</malay> (err) ready I mean all these is like (err) basic <malay>rumahtangga punya</malay> knowledge [ah] right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
like what is (um) it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
(um) civics you know like to for you to understand like [oh] if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing [lah] ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of <malay>macam</malay> very open conversations [lah] but I find it a waste of time for me personally
ya so I told them (err) I I've got work [lah] they will they will still will pressure you then [oh] but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
is not with the is not you don't interview with your <malay>kadi</malay> ya you do with with (err) the the head <malay>kadi</malay> who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
ya so then you have
and the <malay>wakil</malay> from the bride
as in not not necessarily <malay>wakil</malay> [lah] as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought <malay>mak</malay> [ah]
you can ask the mother
I mean like it will be better [lah] right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought <malay>mak</malay> so ya
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya (err) then he <malay>banyak soalan juga</malay> they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
ya
you don't really you don't have a conversation with <malay>kadi</malay> until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the <malay>kadi</malay>
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything [kan] submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of (err) the the <malay>ustaz</malay> is there [lah] he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things [lah] I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and <malay>lepas tu</malay>
I think he asked <malay>mak</malay> some questions then ask #lina# some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two <malay>kakak</malay> there will be asking you <malay>macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada</malay> marriage prep <malay>ni</malay> [eh] (err) <malay>apa</malay> for you to go and then you like [oh] and !alamak! <malay>ni saya bila</malay> [lah] then for me right what happened to me was like <malay>dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh</malay> sign up <malay>ni bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> very informative and everything [lah] they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy [ah] so then after that then they will shut up
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say <malay>aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi</malay> [ah] that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all <malay>macam</malay> a propaganda kind of thing like <malay>semua kena pergi</malay> you know like kind of thing <malay>kena pergi</malay> like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word <malay>kena</malay> you know is like <malay>kau kena pergi</malay>
[ah] you know like like cause like typical (err) like <malay>pasar melayu</malay> they will like say [eh] <malay>kau kena pergi</malay> [tau] <malay>ni</malay>
but that word everybody thinks that [oh] it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word <malay>kena</malay> anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of (err) islamic laws [what] for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told #alina# <malay>macam</malay> I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage [lah] I mean to cut down all the cost [lah] basically like I was telling things things like like <malay>dulang</malay> it's not compulsory you know things like that then (um) a lot of the other things [lah] like red wedding cake [lah] the <malay>kompang</malay> [lah] all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end [what] ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch [oh] now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>semua orang duduk</malay> [kan] and <malay>semua orang boleh tengok macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tengah potong</malay> cake (err)
you know but if you have a typical wedding <malay>macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan</malay> buffet [kan] <malay>dorang jalan ambil makan</malay> everything [kan] a lot of the times my friend <malay>potong</malay> cake <malay>orang kat belakang tak tahu</malay> then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple [lah] some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say [oh] I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>aku faham</malay> but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know <malay>macam</malay> if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point [kan]
(mm) dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say (err) like
it it defeat to me [lah] it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it [lah] like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
ya cause they know I I am <malay>degil</malay> usually [lah] when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the <malay>dia punya mak andam suka</malay> control
<malay>mak andam</malay> is the the the the bride's (err) makeup artist [lah] ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different [leh] like #lina# makeup artist makeup <malay>jalan mak andam</malay> is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife (err) one of them <malay>pakai</malay> scarf so the whole day the <malay>mak andam</malay> there <malay>betulkan</malay> scarf <malay>dia</malay> then the other one (err) what's that called makeup then everything <malay>betulkan</malay> makeup <malay>dia</malay> everything [kan] so
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
so then the groom's side don't have <malay>pak andam</malay> (err) I don't know I think it's called <malay>pak andam</malay> ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so (um) the the girl the they they rent the <malay>baju</malay> [kan] they rent the <malay>baju</malay> then they would they <malay>kain samping</malay> they ask <malay>pak andam</malay> it's all part of money making process [lah]
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends [lah] ya so
(err) a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same <malay>mak andam</malay>
cause people you know like [oh] <malay>ni mak andam aku bagus</malay> [tau] you know your makeup <malay>dia baik</malay> then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends [one] then always the same <malay>mak andam</malay> cause they will try to <malay>macam</malay>
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that <malay>macam aku aku</malay> need <malay>satu jam nak tukar</malay> outfit <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar</malay> makeup <malay>dia tukar baju dia</malay> one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so <malay>katakan</malay> all weddings [eh]
all weddings there will be time time time delay
ya whole day so we so basically <malay>katakan lepas nikah</malay> you plan in your itinerary <malay>habis nikah pukul lapan setengah</malay> (err) let's say <malay>sebelas setengah</malay> your <malay>habis nikah sebelas setengah</malay> right but then you think is <malay>sebelas setengah habis</malay> (err) <malay>pukul dua belas tukar baju</malay> for the next half I can bet with you <malay>sebelas setengah nikah belum habis</malay>
ceremony <malay>nikah</malay> might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone <malay>macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar</malay> [eh] <malay>dah pukul dua belas</malay>
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with <malay>orang nak ambil gambar</malay> every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing <malay>macam semua semua tak pernah</malay> I went to any wedding where is <malay>macam</malay> on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you <malay>macam</malay> [oh] eleven O five you come here like no point [lah] you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad [lah] you don't you don't <malay>macam</malay> because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five <malay>kita turun bawah</malay> eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
really
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know <malay>mak andam suka macam</malay> they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to <malay>selit</malay> as much time as possible so for example
for me [ah] I scold my friends <malay>mak andam</malay> a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing [ah] cause basically like say for my friend right
<malay>dia nikah kat masjid</malay> then <malay>lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar</malay>
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did <malay>kat</malay> #simei# <malay>yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang</malay> to move off they want to move off then after that (err) I'm supposed to move off at (err) twelve o'clock so
ceremony there will start at one thirty
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen [eh] no no now is eleven (err) at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty <malay>ke</malay> eleven forty five around there
then she's like I think we should move off now
[kan] then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing [lah] cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding [eh] eleven thirty she said we should move off now
then after that she went (err) she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the <malay>nikah kat masjid</malay> is the groom's side
the <malay>makan</malay> at #simei# is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum <malay>kita nak kena jalan sekarang</malay> [tau] then the groom's mum (err) <malay>tapi pengantin belum makan</malay> [tau]
<malay>belum makan</malay> [eh] <malay>lepas nikah</malay> everything <malay>ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan</malay> then she said (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga</malay> [pe]
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location [what] how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no <malay>kita pengantin makan</malay> then I told my friends to go and <malay>siapkan</malay> the food
she went behind my back again she tell the <malay>mak</malay> the <malay>mak</malay> (err) <malay>pengantin</malay> both sides [eh] (err) <malay>tak payah makan</malay> [eh] <malay>kita makan kat sana</malay> [jer] [eh] she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like (err) (err) <malay>tak tahu awak tanya salam</malay> that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how <malay>degil</malay> and how angry I can get (err) so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the <malay>mak andam</malay> cannot say anything [lah] she cause she want to turn back (err) she know what I'm gonna say already
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully [lah] it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom [ah] right [ah] exactly <malay>kita dah</malay> plan <malay>dorang makan apa</malay> you want to tell them <malay>makan makan ala kadar</malay> okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the <malay>pengantin</malay> table then she sitting down there
<malay>tak payah tak payah tak payah</malay> like I no [lah] <malay>awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan</malay> ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay [lah] okay [lah] you know
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live (err) a #chendol# station [ah] everything like in the mosque everything [lah] quite quite nice [lah] he paid for everything
then ya [lor] then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is (um) itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty <malay>dorang belum</malay> start <malay>makan</malay> [tau] that in her mind by the time <malay>dorang</malay> start <malay>makan</malay> by the time <malay>dah gini gini aku tak ada</malay> time <malay>nak betulkan rambut si dia ni</malay> that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
<malay>jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau</malay> you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
for me [lah] is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible [lah] in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible [lah] you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the <malay>macam</malay> for me [lah] as the as the the brides (err) [eh] as the best best man I have to <malay>macam</malay> keep everything running [lah] ya
yes transportation is is the problem to me [ah] that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
ya so those those are the things that for me <malay>macam</malay> important [lah] <malay>nak kena tahu macam</malay>
how no no no no yes they their [eh] they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way [lah] you know that they want to save your money and
different person different [lor] ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing [ah] they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be (err) end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he <malay>gi makan</malay> #prata# and everything I told him to go eat #prata# [what] [ah] cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like (err) <malay>suka hati dia nak makan</malay> [lah] he was <malay>kat sini ada makan apa</malay> [eh] you are like <malay>kau tanya aku kat</malay> fort canning <malay>mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai</malay> #prata#
(err) I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at #bedok# reservoir
ya
ya
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you have to also <malay>macam</malay> recce how much are they charging you for rental [lah] because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own <malay>baju</malay>
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to #dewi#
like for me I leave it to #alina# like for me I leave it to #alina# on how you want to to but the thing is like #alina# also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research [mah]
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her <malay>mak andam</malay> makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her <malay>macam</malay> that is all on you
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like [eh] I cannot be splitting it right down the middle [ah] right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like [eh] our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like [eh] I want fifty dollar my problem [lah]
I pay myself [what] that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
it's not a <malay>macam</malay> a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that [one] if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you <malay>macam</malay> maybe some makeup artists [oh] this is hundred dollars that [one] is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have (err) chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that [lah] ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
(mm) salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
(um)
(mm)
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are <malay>sekali</malay> they make you look like a #nyonya# you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
(mm) ya but but like I say these kind of thing <malay>suruh</malay> #dewi# <malay>pergi</malay> Instagram go and stalk people [lah]
[ah] you can just search makeup artist or <malay>mak andam</malay> then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check [oh] !wah! her makeup very nice [ah] look very natural and you go see [oh] it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask #dewi# to message her #alina# I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram (err) for for quotations
(mm)
ya not necessary <malay>mak andam</malay> would be worth it if you are planning to rent <malay>baju</malay> I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they <malay>macam</malay> [oh] because it's (err) package <malay>dengan empat baju</malay> cause it's (err) bride and groom <malay>tukar dua kali</malay> you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of <malay>baju</malay>
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the <malay>baju kurung</malay> you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own (err) western <malay>baju</malay> for example [kan] then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this <malay>mak andam</malay> then she will give you discounts [ah] that kind of thing [lah] ya they all have like their full package
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding (err) expo and everything [kan] so it's a bit different [ah]
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why <malay>macam</malay> your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to <malay>tukar baju</malay> from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography [ah] ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing [lah] ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
(mmhmm) can do that also
(err) I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place [lah] if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled [lah] I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
(mm) can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us [lah]
ya it is quite nice also over there (um) on the wedding day itself [lah] ya
as in your wedding day [lah] I want to book the indigo room over there [oh] no need [lah] ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points [oh] no need [lah] no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel (mm) no need no need no need
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and <malay>mak</malay> then that's it [lah] for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves [lah]
(um)
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well [lah] I would say (err) okay so basically
you have to see
(mm) yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and #alina# did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
!wah! she the that that that girl is amazing [ah] ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
just to put at the front so when during <malay>kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah</malay>
<malay>orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk</malay> they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after <malay>orang makan</malay> they can go to the park
but
at the same time you cannot expect people <malay>dah makan jalan</malay> [ah] is okay you also cannot expect <malay>dah makan jalan</malay> [lah] you know that kind of thing [ah] [eh] <malay>kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan</malay> [lah] you cannot do that [what] right
ya it's all it's all my cousins [lor] all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early [kan] ya
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also [oh] might as well <malay>aku dah datang pukul sebelas</malay> might as well <malay>aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah</malay> you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the <malay>nikah</malay> all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like !wah! I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues [lah] basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about (err) the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important [lah]
we didn't walk in
ya <malay>nikah</malay> it started off with <malay>nikah</malay> #alina# seated #alina# seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no <malay>kompang</malay> or nothing [what]
(mm) ya <malay>dah habis ambil gambar kita makan</malay> ya
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
<malay>janji melayu mana ada mana</malay>
ya
the <malay>kalau tak nak</malay> stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible [lah] but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was <malay>nikah</malay>
<malay>makan jalan</malay>
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like <malay>kau nak ambil gambar ni tak</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>sembarang</malay>
<malay>boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang</malay> [ah] like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be <malay>macam</malay> that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you <malay>macam</malay> he eleven [oh] eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten <malay>nak kena ke bawah</malay> eleven fifteen you <malay>kita jalan</malay> then like
I was like
<malay>takkan jadi</malay> during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take <malay>macam</malay> you have to tell the makeup [oh] you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time [lah] from <malay>mak andam</malay> we get I get that and everything but the same time <malay>macam</malay> as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time [mah] you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on [oh] this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know <malay>dua belas tak boleh</malay> [ah] but anything before that you want to change anything <malay>kira</malay> for me is like now you can be flexible
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
and you must also understand <malay>macam lepas dah nikah</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti ada orang ambil gambar</malay>
then <malay>nak salam</malay> that kind of thing [kan] and <malay>nak orang turun</malay>
<malay>dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok</malay> the tea ceremony
things like that [lah]
okay
(mmhmm) I would say you don't need to worry about the activity [ah] people will just take picture with you [lah]
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing [eh] no one no one cares [lah]
my the recent one with my with my (err) sister in law's brother we did at (err) malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
I mean that is considering is still during this period [ah] I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
ya no problem [lah]
<malay>tak</malay> no problem [ah] no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem [lah]
no need [lah] okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know [oh] but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me [ah] especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now [tau] <malay>macam yang datang</malay> members members <malay>kau sendiri</malay> then <malay>macam kalau nak ada bayar</malay> I mean you
no but the two weddings I been to also
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just (err) okay (err) <malay>dia</malay> they just [ah] okay [ah] <malay>keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar</malay> that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come <malay>gitu gitu</malay> just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always <malay>macam</malay> felt that
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's !wah! you got a lot money
to me [lah] personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like [eh] <malay>kau buat apa</malay> I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee [lah] I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me [lah] personally
you know the emcee who likes to takeover <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay <malay>sekarang</malay> groom <malay>awak jumpa dia macam mana</malay> you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements [what]
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
ya I don't find it necessary [lah] I mean unless you what you will have a <malay>macam</malay>
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different [lah] but <malay>tak tak macam buang duit</malay> [ah]
yes
yup we we make our own [lah] (um) cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early [lah] cause it's it's not fast job [mah]
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like !wow!
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
(err) my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
(mm) but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know [one] when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their <malay>mak andam</malay> and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very #kiasu# game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like #alina# throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be [what] then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes [ah] and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks [lah] the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important [lor]
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right (um)
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua orang</malay> pose <malay>macam gini</malay> then <malay>kau</malay> pose <malay>macam gini</malay> that kind of thing you want someone who's like <malay>aku ada</malay> idea <malay>aku</malay> last weekend <malay>aku buat macam gini</malay> [tau] <malay>kau nak buat macam gini</malay> you know that kind of thing then like [eh] <malay>kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang</malay> in thing in thing <malay>orang semua ambil gambar macam gini</malay>
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side [oh] <malay>macam</malay> okay okay okay <malay>ambil gambar</malay> okay okay <malay>kiri kiri sikit</malay> okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff [lah] I would say but I like him because (err) he listens to what I say
ya cause okay like (um) after the <malay>nikah</malay> I told #alina# I don't want to take pictures first <malay>lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu</malay> so parents come up here we <malay>salam</malay> then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties (err) came up first and then (err) they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of #alina# and then after that our photographer <malay>macam</malay> ya is ya we I understand all this [ah] they they get super excited <malay>ambil gambar dulu cepat</malay> before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say <malay>cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan</malay> #lina# <malay>dulu</malay>
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought <malay>jom ambil gambar</malay>
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be <malay>macam</malay> okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me (err) <malay>salam</malay> parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps [lah]
[ah] then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional [lah] he listens to me [lah] ya
<malay>tak ada</malay>
yup ya so I just walk around [ah] I told him to follow me ya no [lah] I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked #lina# to go inside then she like
I don't know wedding then she okay no need [ah] ya

<malay>baik</malay>
[ah] I'm good I'm good
<malay>semuanya</malay> okay
[oh] <malay>aku baru balik dari</malay> #batam# meet my family during this COVID [lah]
okay everything is normal but then
some place most of the places is quiet [lah] some of them (err) <malay>ada yang dah tutup tak ada apa tu</malay> business [kan] some of them close
[ah] like massage parlours all <malay>dah tutup</malay>
a lot <malay>yang</malay> know like people with families [lah] with families I think affected them a lot <malay>orang</malay> some of them <malay>macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari</malay> you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over <malay>kesian</malay>
(err) yes (err)
like one of them (err)
is now doing the parking the parking
so he <malay>dia dah tak dah takde kerja</malay> so he <malay>buat tu</malay> [lah] parking [lah] do the parking
and then (err) #anas# is
doing (err) more of for farming
<malay>sayur</malay>
<malay>tanam sayur kat kat kat apa dekat tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dekat tu kat</malay> #barelang#
<malay>tanam sayur dapat gaji</malay> [lah] <malay>sikit-sikit</malay>
ya <malay>yang macam</malay> [kan] normally [kan] over there when you park your car before you move [kan] <malay>ada orang datang</malay> they they call it <malay>orang tukang</malay> parking [lah] so they <malay>jaga</malay> to park <malay>jaga</malay> that parking area parking shift so one day I think the pay is about hundred thousand which is about singapore ten dollars
[eh] ya ten dollars [lah]
just to (err)
(err) so corn is a one year harvest program [lah] something like that
[ah] so if one year harvest corn then one year later
harvest already then after that <malay>jual</malay> [ah] <malay>kat pasar</malay> okay okay okay then other than that how's how's the the the the mall there the tourists there and the
what do you call it the massage spa <malay>abeh</malay> shopping centre
how's the the the the the situation there
[oh] okay okay okay ya see I see I see then when when you come back from (err) #batam# I I know you went #batam# but I when did you went to #batam#
you went there for your business
!huh! that means from singapore you have to fly to #jakarta# first then from #jakarta# quarantine for one night <malay>lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang</malay> then <malay>pergi</malay> #batam# why never go #batam# directly from singapore take ferry
I see
[ah] okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve (err) november
[orh] then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks [lah] [ah]
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain [lah] facebook [lah] they say not nice [lah] some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from #batam# or is there any requirement that you need to get
okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] okay okay okay so you you
#batam# from #batam# you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront
okay okay #tanah merah# because you know just recently I heard I read this news you know this singaporean that have not return back from singapore for seventeen years [ah] <malay>dia cakap macam macam</malay> nazi [lah] <malay>macam</malay> world war two [lah] <malay>kena halau sana halau sini</malay> I not sure whether it's true or not [lah] but
but I'm not sure
(mm)
okay
very
[ah] it's just probably he never come back to singapore for seventeen years [lah] probably
[ah] maybe
[ah] so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like <malay>macam</malay> nazi [lah] but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information <malay>lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini</malay> probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason [ah]
ya [lah] too much [lah] this one [ah] anyway [ah] so your two weeks how okay everything
[ah] okay [lah] because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have #sentosa# hotel I don't know [lah] these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning [ah] <malay>betul tak</malay> then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
[ah]
[ah]
[orh]
okay [lah] #alhamdulillah# [lah] at least okay <malay>apa</malay> at least something [kan] <malay>daripada takde apa-apa</malay> then <malay>kalau kata orang tu kalau tak nak tak nak tak nak bayar</malay> then <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>keluar duduk kat</malay> singapore [jer] <malay>betul tak</malay>
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay [lah]
[oh] <malay>abeh sekarang tengah buat apa lepak</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang tak buat apa-apa</malay> [ah]

ya true true true
okay [lah] you control your own finances [lah] in a way that you can control your time then <malay>kalau ada apa-apa boleh habis siang kalau takde apa-apa boleh kerja lambat sikit</malay> so at least in a way

talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks [dah] end of the year already !wah! very fast man correct or not [ah]
!alamak!
[ah]
new year <malay>tahun ini</malay> <malay>jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak</malay>
<malay>betul betul betul</malay> I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd [lah] so
<malay>kemungkinan</malay>
<malay>apa-apa yang</malay> countdown <malay>semua dekat</malay> neighbourhood estate [jer] [lah]
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning [lah] <malay>macam</malay> north east south west <malay>ke apa</malay> so <malay>kat mana-mana yang</malay> okay <malay>kau tinggal</malay> north <malay>ada bunga api tinggal</malay> south <malay>ada bunga api</malay> west <malay>ada bunga api</malay> so instead of going to the central <malay>punya bunga api</malay> so everybody goes your own division their own area their own <malay>kampung</malay> to enjoy [lah] but anyway I mean
this is a new beginning [ah] they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know [lah] [ah] I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
singapore <malay>bila</malay>
sixteen march <malay>ke</malay>
sixteen march [eh]
sixteen march <malay>dia orang tutup</malay> sixteen march <malay>sekali kira</malay> march april may june july august september november [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sembilan bulan</malay> [ah]
but but very fast [ah] nine months
<malay>pejam celik pejam celik dah</malay> nine months <malay>dah nak masuk satu tahun</malay>
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one [ah] that's what they said is probably two two [lah] so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
(mm)
okay [lah] spend money in singapore [lah] staycation now government give [ah] hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel [lah] I think you have to book to those but five platform only
<malay>tak</malay>
you no need to take <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [what] what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
the places that you want to go (err) places of interest or staycation
you have to book through these five different platform okay (err) <malay>yang satu</malay> #changi# and then (err) I think trip (err) there's another three more [lah] <malay>aku tak ingat mana satu</malay> (err) then
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass [ah] and then from there then you can use [lah] you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself [ah] you can use that or you can use partly the only thing <malay>yang</malay> you cannot do <malay>yang kau tak boleh buat</malay> is <malay>kau buat</malay> stack up <malay>maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>dua ratus kita</malay> stay in hotel for free [ah] <malay>itu tak boleh tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can (uh) offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up [ah] that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it [lah] so in the domination of ten meaning let say <malay>kalau kau</malay> example <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> zoo <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars [lah] or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that [ah] <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> combine [lah] that's how it goes but
okay [lah] they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore [lah] but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one [lah] so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period [ah]
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to <malay>kelam-kabut kata orang</malay> [kan] [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah] next year <malay>pun boleh</malay> january <malay>pun boleh</malay> february <malay>pun boleh</malay> as long as <malay>pakai sebelum</malay> july [lah] so ya
<malay>kau belum pernah pergi</malay> sea aquarium [ah] [eh] talking about sea aquarium <malay>aku pun pernah pergi</malay> [ah] adventure cove
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
[eh]
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo #jurong# bird park #sentosa# I don't want [lah] so all these places went already [ah] so I need to go something different [ah] maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night [ah] maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels [lah] you want to go those like hotel [ah] of course you need to come out still same price [lah] not much difference [ah] anyway
ya
[ah]
serious [ah]
government give us [ah]
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>mampus</malay>
[ah] okay okay I understand
[ah] so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing [lah]
!huh!
<malay>macam mana boleh tak</malay> orginal <malay>ada potong potong ke mampus</malay> <malay>kat mana ni kat</malay> #batam# <malay>ni</malay> indonesia [lah]
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah [lah] example [ah] one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
<malay>dia ambil</malay> they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end <malay>sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>kurang</malay> [ah] !wah! <malay>ini macam pun boleh</malay> [eh] <malay>mati</malay>
<malay>kesempatan dalam kesempitan</malay>
<malay>mampus</malay> take advantage of the whole situation [lah] to get something [ah]
be quite too expensive or what
no
!huh!
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
!huh! I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then (uh) hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up [what] then what's the point of
<malay>takut</malay>
<malay>takut daripada</malay> negative <malay>jadi</malay> positive
!huh!
bullshit
!huh!
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive [what] right so why is the other way round
what the
<malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>betul-betul punya tak faham</malay>
really happen
until now [ah]
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
[oh] that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better [what]
funny [ah]
why [ah] like that
anyway
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
ya
[oh] ya ya #saiful# one so touching [ah] I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that <malay>pergi kat semberang tambak</malay> #johor# and and one of them <malay>dekat</malay> woodland one of them <malay>dekat</malay> #johor# <malay>dekat apa tu tempat tu</malay> [eh] [eh]

no pay leave two months [lah] singapore no pay leave two months [ah]
[ah] then after that bring in the wife come singapore
!huh!
<malay>tak tahu</malay> because if not have to pay still have to pay [what] that means he if he bring his wife
[oh] ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia #johor# you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation [lah]
<malay>empat ribu enam ratus ringgit ringgit dah macam</malay> divide by three one thousand plus [lah] so he has to stay two weeks first in the hotel for stay home I mean (err) [lah] consider
but singapore
the the the cases zero [what] community wise why go there still still need to
stay for two weeks instead of seven days <malay>kelakar betul</malay> [lah] malaysia <malay>ini</malay>

I mean if if if now (err) the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go #johor# knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now

so for me nowadays you you see my new family #cusina#
[oh] ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing [ah] because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation [eh] whereby if let's say you go to
any restaurants or you go to online or you want you know singaporeans being singaporeans we want to taste a lot of foods I mean that is nice there is is a nature is a niche correct so <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a lot of <malay>macam</malay>
food [eh] asian food [eh] <malay>kau kata</malay> [kan] japanese chinese korean
thai vietnamese
that is all halal [tau] in southeast don't talk about malaysian food indonesian food [lah] <malay>banyak kat</malay> singapore if you talk about talk about japanese halal food there is a lot okay coming up
you are talking about chinese halal food <malay>banyak ada</malay> [kan] you're talking about thai halal there is thai vietnamese are halal <malay>ada</malay> so
indian okay [lah] they have <malay>tak payah cakap</malay> [ah] western so many fusion food you go to arab street you see from one end to one end a lot of fish and chips whatever was so I was thinking I was asking my girlfriend hopefully [lah] #inshaallah# [eh] <malay>kalau mungkin jadi isteri</malay> [kan] I was asking her [eh]
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
[ah] is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and (err) gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place [lah] be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put (err) (err) (err)
different taste local of a filipino taste [lah] so yes we did that already so #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
and then (err) lemon herbs and then the other one is portuguese spicy so all filipino <malay>punya</malay> taste [lah] so okay [lah] #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in so we are doing that and then (err) come out into pasta and we are coming up into some filipinos taste [lah] so hopefully
home made [ah]
hopefully [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
correct
[ah]
[ah]
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully [lah] [ah] be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet [lah] because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first (uh) (uh)
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it (err)
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert [lah] then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
and thai tea made made made of thai tea [lah] crepes and everything and just this simple (err) food of (uh) tea I think tea tea thailand and (uh) crepes and and (err) of course she use to be an air stewardess but now she because she of this COVID everything right so she open a home based business [lah] #alhamdulillah# it was it was people like accepting it and that they order and I was like [eh] not bad [ah] and she's basically just a local doing thai milk tea and thai crepes only (uh) <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia punya kirakan dia punya</malay> ingredient [ah]
okay [lah] good [lah] I was thinking
correct
true
ya [lah]
so ya [lah] so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully [lah] hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit [lah]

mango <malay>buah mangga</malay> any thoughts okay so <malay>bila dengar bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] (uh) this word what comes to your mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango [jer] when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing <malay>apa</malay> [jer]
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great [ah] okay
I happen to like mango <malay>juga</malay> so (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango [jer] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !woo! <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] like
<malay>nak</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam nak makan</malay> [jer] mango [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal</malay> mango [jer] <malay>macam nak makan sahaja</malay> so (uh) first [jer] <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango
actually <malay>bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam rasa</malay>
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
I don't know if you've (uh) I don't I don't know if any of you <malay>dah pernah dengar ke tak</malay> but
the brand mango <malay>ni memang makcik</malay> I <malay>memang suka pakai <malay>baju</malay> mango this T shirt from this brand <malay>nama dia</malay> mango (err) by the way <malay>ini</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> sponsored [lah] [eh] so <malay>kita ya faham-faham</malay> [jer]
okay so what comes to mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango kita <malay>dah berbual</malay> okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay
okay <malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>buah</malay> mango <malay>ini kalau kita berbual</malay> if we talk about the shape we are
it's it's not a definite shape I can say [ah] it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or [ah] specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
(um) it's slightly bended it's <malay>bengkok sikit ke dalam</malay> <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok betul-betul</malay>
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
something <malay>macam apa benda ya</malay> shape <malay>dia</malay> so
mango <malay>ini memang</malay> interesting <malay>memang</malay> it's
unique
<malay>selain daripada bentuk dia ini</malay>
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can somehow cut it well in a way that <malay>kita boleh makan betul tak</malay>
(mm) so <malay>kita boleh potong belah dua</malay> we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so <malay>dia macam kotak-kotak gitu</malay> so we can we can eat it like that <malay>atau kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kupas kulit dia</malay> and then <malay>kita boleh makan</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) we slice it we we can just slice the
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
and okay shape it's <malay>memang</malay> irregular <malay>tapi dia macam bentuk yang</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak pelik sangat bila kita makan</malay>
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
(uh) <malay>selain daripada besides the shape
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
about one or two colours so <malay>dia ada</malay> colour yellow <malay>dia ada</malay> colour <malay>oren</malay>
and <malay>dia ada juga</malay> colour <malay>hijau</malay> so <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>hijau itu</malay>
okay <malay>selain hijau</malay> there's also there's also red <malay>betul tak</malay>
okay so (err) these four types <malay>yang paling banyak kita</malay> like the ones that we see a lot
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
usually the the ones that we usually see <malay>betul tak</malay> so
(err) <malay>yang paling sedap</malay>
I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> <malay>yang mana yang paling sedap</malay> because I've only tried
a few types of mango
and yeah
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well <malay>macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so (uh) the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite my favourite fruit
so ya moving on (err)
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes <malay>nak cari dekat mana</malay> [eh] mango <malay>ini</malay>

<malay>dalam</malay> context singapore [eh] <malay>kita boleh cari</malay> mango <malay>ini</malay>

<malay>entah</malay> [eh] when okay when the colour the colour of the mango [kan] yellow [kan]
it's
<malay>bila</malay> the first thing when you see
yellow
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is <malay>betul-betul</malay> attractive
and
it just draws
my attention to it so <malay>bila nampak macam</malay> colour colour #bingsu# like she said (uh) she mentioned earlier <malay>bila nampak</malay> colour colour #bingsu# <malay>macam</malay>
!ee! <malay>nak</malay> [ah] <malay>tengok macam</malay> the first thing I see is the the
(err) mango #bingsu#

if we're going to talk about <malay>benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan</malay> there's definitely mango as a brand <malay>itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu macam</malay>
it's like a brand
<malay>yang</malay> quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a (uh) (err) a fruit name for a brand because
(uh) they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all [lah] because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
<malay>cuma</malay> word mango [jer] <malay>kot</malay> I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like <malay>macam betul-betul macam</malay> !wah! <malay>nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam</malay>
I guess
that's interesting

because <malay>kita tak pernah</malay> I mean <malay>jarang</malay> [lah] <malay>ya berbual pasal</malay> mango that's what I find it interesting <malay>kalau kita berbual untuk</malay> our first recording <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
about having mango soda
<malay>tak pernah ada</malay> [kan]
do you have have you had any mango sodas
I really wish <malay>ada</malay> mango soda
(um) that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time <malay>kot</malay>
okay
(uh) do you know that (uh) in some parts of the world <malay>dekat luar negeri</malay> some parts of the world <malay>dekat tempat lain</malay>
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking [kan] (um)
the fact that <malay>dekat</malay> southeast asia <malay>dekat asia tenggara kita</malay> actually the king of fruits <malay>ini</malay>
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about (um)
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
<malay>buah mangga</malay>
okay
so besides that (uh) okay the the scientific name [eh] <malay>untuk ini ini buah</malay> is actually mangifera indica
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit <malay>itu macam semacam buah itu</malay> the type <malay>dia nama dia</malay> stone fruit
[kan] (uh) <malay>ada</malay> berry <malay>ada apa apa semua</malay> then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because <malay>memang</malay> if you look at it
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
okay so it means [ah] okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so <malay>dia punya biji</malay> (err) <malay>biji buah dia itu memang besar</malay>
<malay>buah mangga betul tak</malay>
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
okay and mango <malay>itu</malay> actually <malay>juga</malay> native <malay>dekat</malay> india
<malay>dekat</malay> india <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>senang nak cari dekat situ</malay>
(uh) southeast asia <malay>asia tenggara</malay> that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
how interesting is that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>lama gila</malay> [seh] like what the hell

when you

exactly <malay>itu pasal</malay> okay like okay let's just talk about it I <malay>suka</malay> mango ice cream <malay>yang dia dekat yang ada macam</malay> popsicle <malay>itu</malay>
(uh)
[oh] my god <malay>bila</malay> you take one bite <malay>dia macam</malay>
!wah! <malay>panas-panas makan itu sedap</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay> seriously like that's the best
food that you can have during
really really hot weather
<malay>betul</malay> I don't know
like honestly
<malay>cara</malay> you explain <malay>macam</malay> a bit weird <malay>tapi tak apa</malay> [lah] [eh] I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize <malay>kalau</malay> topic <malay>dia macam</malay> lame <malay>sangat</malay> but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
so because this is our first (uh) topic [kan] so
ya no high expectations I'm so sorry
but yes we're trying
okay
now that we (uh) we hit thirty two minutes let's (err) just
take a break from mango topic because (uh) whoever that is going to listen this for one hour <malay>mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>betul tak</malay> so let's hear about your day what have you done today
thank you for asking I know
question <malay>dia tadi satu</malay> question [eh] <malay>tapi dah melalut</malay> [eh] <malay>tak apa</malay> it's okay
so for my day I today I
okay this week actually is my first week (err) since (err) holiday that school resumes so (err) as per usual I had my class today <malay>tapi</malay> because you know [kan] <malay>sekarang tengah</malay> pandemic <malay>tengah</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> you know like the the virus is you know <malay>masih dekat</malay> singapore <malay>masih ada</malay> cases [lah] [kan] so today we had
for a month actually we have to be (uh) doing classes online
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I <malay>pun dah melalut tak apa</malay> it's okay
I mean
we're just talking we're just having a conversation just chilling
okay back to the topic (err) seriously I think quite sad because <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> [seh] <malay>dekat rumah</malay> like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive <malay>dekat dekat sekolah</malay> like my brain my work like [ah] I can just think and do work
like
much more than I can do work at home <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kerja dekat rumah</malay> cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily <malay>dekat rumah</malay> so your productivity level is not as
much as when you're outside
in school especially
I'm sure some of you would feel the same
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that <malay>dekat rumah lagi</malay> (err) productive [lah] but today is (uh)
quite decent for me
nothing too extreme nothing to some <malay>macam</malay> okay okay [jer] [lah] I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive <malay>dekat rumah ke</malay> or is more productive <malay>dekat luar</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> exactly
okay so
now that we've (uh) talked about our day
let's talk about okay before we going (err) we're going back to talking about the fruit [lah] [eh] cause
I don't know let's just talk about this it's more casual [lah] [kan] so okay (err) what [eh] what food did you have today
(mm) (mm)
I had <malay>sambal</malay> fish and <malay>sambal</malay> egg
then (err) <malay>ada</malay> this <malay>apa nama dia macam</malay> soup <malay>petola gitu</malay>
dengan <malay>bihun bihun</malay> [eh] <malay>ke suun</malay>
so
I think it's <malay>suun</malay> this <malay>dia macam bihun</malay> but it's like (um)
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles <malay>yang dari</malay> japan so I think that's what it is then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (um) ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today (um) because you know (uh) work's getting really really stressful <malay>jadi macam</malay> you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then (err) <malay>lepak lepak [dah] itu</malay> [jer]
then okay let's (uh) start talking about next thing shall we talk about fruits still or shall we move on to another topic
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>apa yang</malay> best [eh] <malay>nak berbual</malay> okay let's talk about our favorite music
okay what (uh) which artist do you listen to the most
(um) <malay>kalau kita berbual pasal</malay>
artist okay <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very (err) much the same as hers (um) it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
okay but
(um) I wouldn't say okay my favourite song
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay>
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay that song is my favourite song
it
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have <malay>jadi macam bila dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god my emotions <malay>semua keluar</malay> but like
that's just what you feel about it
(err) I rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that I'm talking about it now
okay so (uh) besides that (err) canon in D [eh] that's one genre that I don't listen all the time but that that's a song that I really really like above all the other songs that I hear
and okay
let's talk about the next genre my next genre <malay>yang</malay> favourite <malay>itu</malay> let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between (err) western songs <malay>dengan</malay>
k-pop
they both have very distinct (uh) features they both have
however <malay>macam</malay> similar <malay>dia itu macam sama tapi lain</malay> [lah] you you you get what I mean
<malay>dia punya</malay> upbeat <malay>dia punya</malay> instrumental <malay>semua sama tapi</malay> it's just that the language probably different <malay>kot macam</malay> that's the distinct difference
okay and then (um) my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's <malay>paling banyak lagu-lagu</malay> western <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>kot</malay> that is the one that's very popular
I I would say <malay>lagu</malay> (um)
(uh) <malay>dah lupa tajuk dia</malay>
[ah] I will never let you down by rita ora I think that song is very empowering
besides that okay I I also listen to spanish songs and
[ah] I <malay>tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini</malay> but
it's called #mevoy# M E V O Y <malay>daripada</malay> [eh] the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice <malay>dia</malay>
the the background music has this (um) hum
accordion and I don't know it's just it's just very
it's very cute like when you listen to the song you would think of being in the
feel and what not
okay because we're (err) recording at a very late time because my sister just got back from work so please
just
hold on we still have about twenty minutes left like less than twenty minutes left
everything is going great
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] [ah] [oh] ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I <malay>main asal asal</malay> [jer]
<malay>sebarang</malay> [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
<malay>entah banyak</malay> man I have a lot of groups that I like
(err)
I cannot name any of them I'm so sorry
then (err) okay I also because (err) this is my family is an (um) indonesian family so <malay>kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada</malay> indonesia <malay>juga</malay> [lah] so (err)
we are actually from
<malay>jawa pulau jawa</malay>

we would say it as <malay>pulau jawa</malay>
that's where we come from and then <malay>lagu-lagu</malay> from there is <malay>semua</malay>
variety <malay>juga</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> they have (err) songs <malay>yang macam</malay> western western <malay>gitu dia orang pun ada</malay> songs <malay>macam</malay> ballad
<malay>dia ada</malay> genre genre [ah] <malay>koplo</malay> [oh] my god <malay>koplo</malay> my favourite genre
it's <malay>dia macam</malay> traditional <malay>gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat</malay>
that's very interesting (uh)
we'll have this (uh) genre thingy conversation in another recording [lah] [eh]

<malay>tadi</malay> a bit fun [lah] okay so
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay [lah] that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
petty a petty reason for me to dislike someone would definitely be his his or her <malay>punya</malay> (um)
(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
okay [lah] okay okay okay <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>orang tu nak</malay> hang out <malay>dengan</malay> I right <malay>tapi dia macam</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak macam kawan dia</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak dengan</malay> members <malay>dia semua</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
(uh)
[ha] okay
<malay>apakah</malay> okay wait wait wait
<malay>ceritakan suatu pengalaman yang sebenarnya lucu tetapi mungkin tidak lucu pada masa itu</malay>

and <malay>buang seluar dalam</malay>
<malay>kat mana ni</malay>
ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
!huh! okay
(uh) <malay>cerita kelakar</malay>
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house [ah]
!huh!
ya ya what do think of the house [ah]
(mmhmm)
keep talking [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean for me ya [lah] I mean it's I do feel
I mean once in a while like I do feel <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>sedih</malay> that
<malay>yang apa ni</malay>
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
I mean certain things you like a bit <malay>sedih</malay> right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah]
ya
your your your your new phone <malay>masih banyak</malay> battery [kan]
you just get <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health <malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [ah]

I sometimes I just just sometime sometimes I <malay>tengok</malay> the <malay>gambar semua</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> like
you know cannot believe that <malay>macam tak percaya</malay> that
you know we started off from here
and it became like one

<malay>jap</malay> [eh] (oo) they got a lot of question
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like <malay>tukar</malay> and then <malay>cakap bahasa melayu</malay>
you know <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way <malay>nak cakap melayu</malay> all the way because
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay>
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay> means like I'm about to cry you know like I'm about to
I'm about to really go deep
with my feelings but when I say I'm expressing like I just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when I say I <malay>nak luahkan perasaan kat</malay> you [ah]
<malay>maknanya</malay> I <malay>macam ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cakap sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena</malay> (uh)
<malay>nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena cakap</malay> [lah]
then <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> <malay>macam berat sangat</malay>
<malay>macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal</malay> !wah! see
<malay>janggal</malay>
you you <malay>tak tahu makna janggal</malay> you <malay>teka makna janggal apa</malay>
just <malay>teka</malay> [lah]

<malay>kayu-kayu jadi boleh buat</malay> (uh) <malay>perabot</malay>
<malay>yang ketiga</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>kemahiran</malay>
(uh) <malay>elektrik</malay>
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
(uh) would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
<malay>suatu hari</malay>
<malay>anda bangun dari tidur dan mendapati bahawa anda telah menjadi seorang pelakon</malay>
<malay>siapakah pelakon itu dan mengapa anda memilihnya</malay>
okay
<malay>pelakon</malay>
<malay>yang saya</malay>
(um) <malay>memilih</malay>
[ah] <malay>ialah</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
<malay>siapa yang jadi</malay> spiderman <malay>yang barunya yang</malay> the latest one tom holland ya
<malay>saya ingin menjadi</malay> tom holland <malay>kerana</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) <malay>sungguh</malay> (um)
(uh) talented
I have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)
that <malay>dia muda</malay>
<malay>saya ingin menjadi muda kembali</malay>
(uh)
<malay>muda dan</malay> (uh) <malay>berjaya</malay>
ya tom holland
<malay>bagaimana pula dengan anda</malay>
<malay>pilihan</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay <malay>kejap jap jap</malay>
okay (um)
[eh] <malay>jap jap</malay> you know what I want to <malay>tengok</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your brother <malay>hantar</malay>
then <malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
ya <malay>satu jam kena berbual satu jam</malay>
just <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>satu jam</malay> the no okay the thing is I think what the
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now I'm speaking in english and then suddenly I <malay>tukar</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> you <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
I think <malay>saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila</malay>
<malay>yang paling mustahak ialah apabila</malay>
<malay>dan kenapa</malay>
<malay>dan dari situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>memberi</malay> (uh)
<malay>kesinambungan</malay>
<malay>bagaimana</malay>
<malay>dan apabila</malay>
(uh) <malay>diorang diorang ingin</malay> (um)
<malay>diorang ingin mengetahui</malay>
<malay>cara-cara</malay>
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk <malay>ni semua</malay> we don't really
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where I can just easily go in go out <malay>nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap</malay> english <malay>cakap</malay> english
and
then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] but the fact that <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> certain words <malay>macam</malay> like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like <malay>macam</malay> !alah!
ya
ya <malay>macam dia macam tak</malay> natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes <malay>lagi dua puluh minit sahaja</malay> okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I <malay>nak tengok yang</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your your brother <malay>hantar tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] I'm glad that they that the <malay>yang</malay> [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
<malay>nasib baik tu yang benda tu</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dah habis</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
ya <malay>rumah kita besar</malay> [sia]
yes
[a'ah] <malay>macam lama</malay> [sia]
no [lah] I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> first first christmas
to fully <malay>pindah</malay> but I mean we can slowly live there
my things I'm gonna <malay>letak sikit-sikit</malay> [tau] I'm not gonna like one time go there I'm just gonna put things bit by bit because I <malay>takde kotak</malay>
I probably gonna take a few <malay>kotak</malay> and all that for of course office
<malay>muat ke</malay>
[oh] <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] ya
I really <malay>suka</malay> the <malay>yang kitanya</malay> flooring flooring <malay>kita cantik</malay>
ya
[ah] [oh]
<malay>yang yang kerusi belakang tu kena</malay> screw [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>semua</malay> [ah] <malay>semua kena buat</malay> [ah]
if <malay>ikat</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam kelakar</malay> [eh] <malay>takde</malay> <malay>kat dalam bilik ni</malay> [eh]
[ah] [sia] <malay>besar</malay> [seh]
I mean <malay>kita boleh pergi</malay> later
we can go later we can go tomorrow
!wah! [eh] the counter <malay>tak cantik</malay> [ah]
yup
no [lah] <malay>kita kena kena kena letak dulu</malay> [pe] [oh] <malay>takleh</malay> [eh]
okay so okay
!ee! best [lah] I <malay>tengok</malay> I I I <malay>tengok</malay> the kitchen best [seh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh]
I think the kitchen <malay>cantik</malay> [ah] like after we <malay>letak</malay> after the <malay>apa ni</malay> the
<malay>dia</malay>
ya
after <malay>dia letak</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap</malay>
I think the whole idea <malay>yang</malay> [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
I kinda like it though
<malay>ye ke</malay>
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] <malay>ini diorang boleh</malay> spray [eh]
okay
so <malay>yang ni nanti nanti</malay> next few days <malay>baru pasang</malay> [ah]
<malay>kena tunggu benda tu kering</malay> [eh]
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
<malay>besar sikit</malay> [tau] <malay>tebal sikit</malay> actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya <malay>lebih tebal sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
if were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be [ah] <malay>ni ni</malay> <malay>ni ni soalan</malay> best
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
<malay>pilihan pertama</malay>
<malay>adalah satay</malay>
<malay>satay lembu</malay>
<malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketupat sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi kuah satay banyak-banyak banyak letak banyak bawang banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>banyak bawang</malay> and <malay>banyak timun</malay>
(uh)
ya <malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
I can eat that I think for every single meal
<malay>pilihan kedua</malay>
<malay>seperti anda</malay>
<malay>adalah nasi sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng adalah hidangan</malay>
<malay>yang lengkap</malay>
<malay>dia manis dia pedas ada masin</malay>
you know
<malay>dia lengkap</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng</malay> is what I would call a perfect meal
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
<malay>besok</malay> I want <malay>makan nasi sambal goreng</malay>
[oh] <malay>besok nak pergi tu yang yang kita pergi nasi padang dengan</malay>
[oh] <malay>kat situ ada nasi sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>ada tak</malay>
<malay>sedap</malay> [ah] <malay>yang nasi sambal goreng tu</malay>

where the wall is [ah] ya <malay>yang dia letak</malay> [ah]
<malay>cantik</malay> [eh]
ya
which I don't think so
I sincerely don't think so [lah] seriously don't think that it's gonna be
just take a look
ya ya ya we wanna change ya we wanna change in february
february is soon by the way
should die ya actually <malay>ni cantik</malay> [eh]
actually even this [one] <malay>dekat letak dekat apa ni</malay> the dining are <malay>pun cantik</malay> [ah]
<malay>cantiknya</malay>
[ah]
this is so <malay>cantik</malay>
[eh] <malay>cepat</malay> [lah] <malay>babi</malay> [ah]
!wah!

okay
okay ya
we're good
alright [eh] <malay> macam [eh] [eh] okay [ah]
okay [ah] <malay> boleh boleh no problem
[ah] [eh] [eh]
[eh] bro school is [eh] I hate school
school can go suck dick I'm telling you
okay (uh) #rabak# <malay> gila okay you imagine [eh] okay <malay> kau kau just imagined
<malay> aku I got I got like one (uh) one website
okay [eh] I got one website for
for this one module okay I've five modules [lah]
so I have my student portal that's one website
okay [ah] then I got one website for my
(uh) module submission for another module
I have one website for this other module submission
okay one other website for this one <malay> punya module <malay> macam Q&A
in total [kan] <malay> kau tahu in total <malay> aku ada berapa banyak website
<malay> aku ada like around nine websites <malay> tahu in total and this is just week four
apa #lanchiau# [ah] <malay> aku tanya engkau apasal [lah]
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites [kan] is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like you know you know
amongst the students [lah]
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like [eh] this one how this [one] how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that [lah] to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like (um) there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
I have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then I have to ya then I have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so I ask around some random stupid questions [ah]
like [oh] this [one] how <malay> padahal this [one] is everyone know <malay> semua orang tahu ini benda
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota [lah]
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat [lah] having a lecture or having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
<malay> kau tak boleh actually learn everything in one shot
<malay> kau tak boleh ask your on the left on the right
<malay> kau tak boleh
ask even the professor [lah]
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use Zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively [what]
so <malay> aku just <malay> bingit gila having this online lesson actually <malay> aku tak kisah tahu pasal COVID
<malay> tapi ever since this <malay> aku masuk [eh] !wah! !wow! <malay> aku bilang kau #rabak# <malay> gila
seriously it's so ineffective then I'm
I I like stay up until like two A M almost everyday [sia] just to do work
#rabak# <malay> gila [ah]
#rabak# <malay> gila [ah] ya [sia] #rabak# <malay> gila I tell you
(mmhmm) ya
ya
but
[ah] [sia] seriously as I (err) I didn't know uni is so bad that it's legit just <malay> kau pandai pandai [ah]
<malay> kau imagine like on the first week
not not on the first week [lah] like almost all lectures I have
this one lecture I have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example [ah] python (err) you there's this [one]
[ah] ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input [ah] input format [lah]
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
<malay> aku pun tak tahu [ah] ya ya some
it's it's just so bad [ah] like and then
I don't know like even the other day
(err) I have this other module okay
[ah] it's basically I'm learning about digital electronics [lah]
okay so <malay> aku kena
I I got some friends [lah] I got some friends here and there
and then after that they because <malay> aku from engineering background <malay> apa
right so <malay> dia orang pernah tanya aku [ah] [eh] #koi# can teach me or not this this this okay [ah] <malay> boleh aku ajar engkau [ah]
then the other day I I taught two of them I only took
two hours to teach them I think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
[ah] like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad [lah] because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things [eh]
ya and
ya and honestly I didn't expect that it would be that way
because I thought that
when people say Singapore university of self study [eh]
okay like that's what people say [lah] my friend also say that he's in
and then after that I'm like okay [lah] maybe is terrible [lah]
but then when I come to I expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
they just <malay> macam [ah] okay [ah] <malay> kau buat gini [ah] okay <malay> kau tahu bagus kau tak tahu [ah] <malay> kau belajar [ah] Google [ah]
<malay> apasal like
I don't know [ah] to me it's it's it's just nonsense [ah]
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like I think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two
(err) asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
[sia] [lah] poly <malay> mana ada aku stay up <malay> sampai pukul dua pagi [sia] <malay> buat kerja
in uni I have to constantly stay up until two just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up [ah] just to do it
then it's just like it's just so I don't know
this is just too crazy [lah] honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent [lah]
(err) I mean I mean we're okay because when you hear like I <malay> aku tak tahu kalau kau ada dengar tak
<malay> tapi aku ada dengar that (um)
this type of high
(um) really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother [one] [ah]
they really not brother [one] but but right at least it's they quite brother [lah] because
(err) and I found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two I have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] irfan</P1> your age [lah] but what I'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya I've never met anyone below twenty [eh]
ya I [eh]
ya ya (uh) everyone there is from like or from poly
wait [eh] hang on [eh]
ya [ah]
<malay> apa dia [ah] <malay> cakap cakap cakap [jer]
[ah] okay
but
[oh] part time uni
(err) (um)
[oh] honestly the
I don't think even is a
I don't know is a good choice or not I got I got two friends in
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work [lah]
there's things to do here and there
ya I think is mainly for people from like from poly the more #rilek# ones [lah] the [one] the not so snake [one]
ya
<malay> aku tak tahu
legit [ah] <malay> aku tak tahu aku tak tahu because I've only heard about all these like up there <malay> punya uni you know
but I but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
<malay> macam gitu [ah]
<malay> tak tahu [ah] <malay> macam mana padahal baru week four
<malay> baik baru baru week <malay> besok is week four <malay> baru week four <malay> aku [dah] ada a test tomorrow
which is ten percent of my grades
<malay> besok (err) six thirty
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test [lah] [eh] no it's a
test from home
but I'm this browser that you know how you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so so my they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down [eh] where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they [ah]
they force they shut things down like
your Telegram
like Discord Steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya [lah]
stewing from that [lah]
ya is it is a browser [lah] on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
I think I no I'm I need to have I need to have internet connection to have the test [lah]
but I cannot access anything else
ya but I need internet connection because it's a test [what]
so they [ah] and then after that the test got webcam [ah]
I need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam [ah] either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam [what]

ya ya
[ah] <malay> macam gitu
yes yes ya that type of thing [ah]
ya so the other day right (um) I I had that [lah]
and then after that [one] of the questions I can remember I two of the questions I cannot remember one of the questions was like
(err) out of all the modules
out of the out of all the modules in the module list right
what modules do you like the most and I'm like [oh] shit
<malay> aku tak tahu [sia] module list <malay> apa so <malay> aku Google [lah]
while during the interview while during the thirty seconds break in between questions right
(err) between question and answer <malay> aku Google [lah] <malay> untuk <malay> untuk dengan module list
<malay> aku Google <malay> untuk module list then <malay> aku tengok tengok tengok then okay <malay> aku [dah] boleh answer
<malay> lepas tu aku answer [kan] (mm) <malay> aku I said [ah] (hmm) (uh) looking through the module list right
I realised that there's this this this [lah] and have done
this this this in the past and also (uh) I have some experience with it okay next question
(err) what modules do you like the least then after that I I reply in this exact same way
looking through the module list (err) I realised that there's maths [lah]
I I'm I'm okay with maths I'm I I did well for maths
but I don't like maths [lah] that's how I replied you know in the interview
and I managed to get through the through the video interview and into the group interview [lah]
ya so the group interview it was like stage two right
so the group interview (um) it was (err)
the group interview was like I thought it was like one group by one group
okay then after that they brought us out to this (err) to this like before this room after registering
then after that I'm like [ah] then I was talking with my group my [lah] then I was like [eh]
if it's a group interview how come we're all over here [sia] going inside this one room is it a mass interview
don't know [ah] maybe [ah]
okay <malay> [dah] masuk [dah] sit down <malay> semua then they introduce themselves
then they're like okay so this is the
this this is the like the contents okay this is the problem
I want you all to you you all got thirty minutes I want you all to work on this
and by the end of the thirty minutes you are to present a
maximum hundred eighty second video presentation using your phone
then I'm like <malay> apasal ini okay <malay> buat [ah] <malay> buat buat buat [dah] berbual
<malay> [dah] berbual pasal content <malay> lepas tu [dah] nak record
<malay> [dah] record <malay> habis [kan] <malay> lepas tu kita hantar [ah]
then like okay you got any questions okay Q&A Q&A <malay> berbual berbual tanya tanya benda then I'm like
okay if there's nothing else that's all you just can go home !huh!
<malay> gitu je <malay> aku macam [ah] [oh] serious [ah] <malay> gitu je [ah] <malay> aku tengok kanan kiri [sia]
ya and then like [ah] okay that's all I was like [ah] okay I expected something a bit more difficult [lah]
then after that like ya we'll then you can go then we'll send you the (uh) the email
saying whether you have passed or not [lah] like next week
okay so I I expected seven days from now [lah]
(mm) okay then on the seventh day from the interview I was like [eh] shit I never received any email [sia]
I never receive any email I was like fuck [ah] <malay> habis I didn't get [lah] after all
then on the eighth day in the morning [oh] I received the email congratulations <malay> baik baik baik
ya <malay> gitu [lah]
[ah] [ah] okay because right
is they want to build it such that
you are working in a team
right so
that's why the group interview
is is mass as a group interview but then they want to see how well you work in a team
how your how well you work in a team
how you would communicate with people how you work with people from different backgrounds
with people that you don't know
so is mainly built on top of that
of how you
it's a very team effort [lah]
so I I guess they evaluate as to how we
were acting in a team okay then after that how well we do our things our
video interview [eh] our video presentation how was it
all all that thing [lah]
ya that's that's how I did it [lah] I don't know maybe because
but then last year

[eh] ultraboost is for casual this [one] is for running
eventhough I have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that I have no time seriously you know I I doing work
right you know I the other day I spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay I had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is I take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation [lah] so I had this [ah]
I had this lake concept method the other time
and (err) I will I couldn't get it to work [lah] even though the concept was there
the idea was there but I couldn't get it to work so I asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept I two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but I cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
then I was like <malay> kenapa [sia] <malay> tak boleh [oh] and then after that I spent I spent like
<malay> aku agak aku spend <malay> macam three four hours on it [lah]
three four hours okay I started at eleven <malay> aku habis pukul dua pagi tahu
<malay> aku habis pukul dua pagi then after that you know what was the problem
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax [lah]
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right I put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
then after <malay> aku just found out that it's because of spacing then <malay> aku bilang kawan aku [eh] okay <malay> kau try <malay> kau letak space
<malay> kau ada problem <malay> tak lepas tu dia orang letak space [a'ah] [lah] [sia] <malay> dia orang pun tak boleh
so <malay> dia orang boleh [ah] <malay> pasal dia orang tak letak space <malay> aku letak space <malay> tak boleh
[sia] [lah]
<malay> kau imagine <malay> tiga empat jam aku duduk depan computer <malay> [dah] pukul satu pagi aku tak is <malay> apasal tak boleh [ah] <malay> aku
<malay> garu kepala garu garu garu [ah] <malay> tak apa [ah] <malay> mandi [ah] <malay> mandi [dah] habis mandi solat [ah] okay okay relax <malay> sikit relax <malay> sikit
<malay> lepas tu continue <malay> buat kerja buat buat buat [eh]
<malay> apasal [eh] <malay> aku stock <malay> aku break down I rewrote my code like three four times
I break everything to everything down okay <malay> apasal ini input <malay> tak boleh ni ni input <malay> kalau aku tulis macam gini boleh ke tak then
ya [lah] so so that's what I I was trying to do [lah] so I break everything down I run bit by bit okay <malay> dari gini
<malay> kenapa tak boleh [eh] okay <malay> aku perasan aku tulis macam gini boleh aku tulis macam gini
<malay> apasal tak boleh [eh] then I found out [eh] okay <malay> aku kalau tak tulis dengan spacing
[eh] <malay> boleh [lah] [sia] <malay> aku tak [eh] <malay> pukimak irritating <malay> apa satu white space or because of one spacebar
<malay> dia kirakan kasi aku error
<malay> dia tunjuk dia tunjuk but but then what they're showing is right
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
then I'm like <malay> apa [sia] twelve comma <malay> tak boleh convert into integer
twelve comma <malay> boleh apa
<malay> habis tu it's because <malay> tahu aku letak twelve comma two comma eight
because that white space right that white space <malay> kirakan anything after that space bar everything will ignore
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course [lah] comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
<malay> aku macam [sia] [lah] <malay> kau orang kau orang just <malay> bunuh aku [sia]
four hours [ah] <malay> lepas aku masuk lepas tu aku [dah] baring aku [dah] baring [dah] masuk katil baring pukul dua two two [ah] two [oh] five <malay> gitu

[ah]
okay (um) I think
still <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>dalam</malay> (err) a hundred plus ya below two hundred should be okay like I think <malay>kita</malay> total <malay>ada empat orang</malay> [jer]
(mm)
should be [lah] anyway <malay>pun</malay> is
[oh] but don't know how strict the hotel is
yup

#tanjong pagar# <malay>boleh buat apa</malay> [sia] #tanjong pagar# <malay>ada apa</malay>
[a'ah] #tanjong pagar#
#tanjong pagar# and #tiong bahru# is
<malay>lain</malay> [kan] I always get them mixed up I always get them mixed up I'm just saying yes

anyway can there be a <malay>macam</malay>
theme for the
why not cause like every time <malay>kita selalu buat</malay> like this kind of theme <malay>apa</malay>
yes ya because that one was <malay>dekat yang halia</malay> so
it's more apt
#tanjong pagar# theme <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>orang pakai</malay> good morning towels [lah]
[kan] I thought that time <malay>yang kita pergi makan</malay> then I was asking #karim# to decide on the matter
to choose for the
gift exchange
I don't know I don't know <malay>dia dah</malay> decide <malay>ke belum</malay> but I think that time <malay>dia ada cakap</malay> R
so it's like okay
I think it was R
(err)
prime [ah] prime
<malay>kat</malay> #sembawang# <malay>ada</malay> too bad <malay>kat</malay> #sembawang# <malay>ada</malay>

I will plan dinner should there be a budget
like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> carousel

[oh]
that's very <malay>menyemak kalau aku jadi</malay> server <malay>tu aku bingit</malay>
<malay>sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak</malay> order
(hmm)
[ah] ya
okay [lah] I think buffet town quite affordable right
[oh] but
that time #karim# got say something about
he wanted to go there but <malay>dia kena</malay> cancel or something you know no like the location <malay>kena</malay> change or something
no
as in
I think he got some meeting right and then after that and then change location or is that have different buffet town
[ah] okay [lah] so I think assuming that we had never eat there before also [lah] !huh!
have you joined us
sad [leh]
coleslaw
jonas very vegan <malay>makan</malay>
no amos and jonas said okay ya ya
then I think
you all also should be okay [what] [kan] terrence #vilan# edward
[eh] but
but then if
the number of pax per table
!aiya!
I don't know
no
okay I can't comment on that
so means it's still five right
so
I thought we can book but <malay>tak boleh</malay> mingle
[oh]
[oh]
okay
so do what should go for five people
first two first two last one
<malay>tapi yang</malay> last one <malay>makan seorang</malay>
how [ah]
(uh huh)
then I mean like like that one is not like small get together [lah]
<malay>ni kat luar</malay>
it's quite filling
okay
okay unless we just keep it to five [lor] like
ya
ya
okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> homecoming [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
reunion school reunion
when
[ah] what was that one day
ya the
fortune cookie
ya
okay [lah] I think
should be okay with five of us right
I mean <malay>tak payah</malay> jonas <malay>pun susah</malay> [kan] <malay>nak makan</malay>
vegan
okay can
wait when when is the dinner
[oh]
[oh] [oh] ya
(mm)
okay [lor]
then like that
we can dinner on twenty eight or twenty nine
at buffet town
<malay>nanti</malay> edward complain <malay>lagi cakap</malay> should have change [lah] should have change [lah]
hopefully
could be
okay
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel [jer] but date is settled [lah] and I think <malay>makan pun</malay> is
[eh] but you said at west
[oh]
we going two days one night [ah]
[oh]
wait twenty eight is (err)
monday sunday sunday [lah] I think it's sunday [lah] sunday monday cause every setup he got one weekend he needs to clear
ya
no I think it's sunday monday
[eh] maybe monday tuesday
[oh] rates
then he say it's like seven hundred online
the I was only four hundred
but how come it's just that date difference [ah]
[oh]
lame
speaking of travel
of course [lah] I mean it's so nice the weather is cold
<malay>kat sini pun dekat</malay> [kan]
hotel <malay>punya</malay> room [jer] [lah]
no
okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer !hais! that was
global warming
too bad
okay [lah] but at least you went out so still okay
okay [lah]
then like that
(hmm) more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
[oh] ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that (um) what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
(mm)
!huh!
<malay>tak cukup ke</malay>
I thought they are going to prioritise <malay>yang</malay> the elderly or like
[ah]
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay [lah] probably
it's gonna be better
!huh! but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young [lah]
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest [lah] is like
don't know <malay>kalau dekat sana</malay> like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
[ah] I was looking at this youtube (um)
the youtube is from america [lah]
then like it's (err) <malay>pasal</malay> plants
yes
so it's like (um)
she
went to a nursery with
<malay>dia punya mak</malay>
like plant nursery with <malay>dia punya mak</malay>
then (um) the funny thing was <malay>dia seorang</malay> [jer] <malay>yang pakai</malay> mask
<malay>mak dia tak pakai</malay> mask
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear [lah] I don't know [lah] it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
<malay>mak dia tak pakai</malay> mask so it's like !huh!
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
and ya [lah] <malay>dia orang punya rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>selalu</malay> mansion mansion <malay>berapa</malay> storey <malay>semua</malay> [kan] so they can afford the space but it's already like
there's a lot of different plants that (um) she feature [lah]
and then (err) the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya <malay>dekat</malay> desert <malay>punya bukan</malay>
no no is not succulent it's like probably <malay>macam</malay> the height
no it's like <malay>macam</malay> the height of the snake plant [ah]
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent [what] no [meh]
no it's like
[ah] it's like a
(um)
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not <malay>bukan macam kau punya</malay> this thing
ya it's like (um) apparently when the leaves are young
like
it's quite bendy but then <malay>bila dia dah tua</malay> like it's quite stiff kind
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though [ah]
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
<malay>yang dia beli tu</malay> is quite an old one so it's quite tall
ya it's quite tall
<malay>pokok</malay> mango
yes
(mmhmm)
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
<malay>ada banyak</malay> problem than benefit
cause I think it's like (um) you see
in a
especially like a globalized world right now <malay>macam kalau</malay> you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of disruptions
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
<malay>bukan</malay> natural way [lah] like like the business way the business way is that <malay>macam kena</malay> halt and and
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think (um)
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because <malay>macam</malay> like
you think about it all the businesses <malay>dia orang punya</malay> momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then <malay>kena</malay> halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of (err) during business [ah] so it's too soon to adapt
(um) and there's no leeway [lah]
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
cause <malay>macam</malay> like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area [lah] but myself like #ang mo kio# this kind of area my <malay>banyak orang-orang tua</malay> live right then like you see those <malay>apek-apek duduk bawah</malay> block <malay>baca surat khabar</malay> that kind just like just <malay>duduk bawah</malay> block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is <malay>macam</malay>
it like I think
I don't know but I feel [lah] <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay>
normal way of living <malay>pun kena</malay> change forcefully change so in that sense you especially <malay>bila dia orang dah</malay> like this kind of age
it's not so healthy because
one thing is that <malay>dia orang pun</malay> could probably be living alone and this is their only form of <malay>macam</malay> keeping sane and (err) you know socialise that kind of thing like
in their own way of keeping healthy [lah] so I think in that sense (err) that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
businesses wise I think (um) I think between businesses and societal <malay>macam</malay> thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think <malay>kalau macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you are just #suay# [lah] then you just <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>baru</malay> then <malay>kena</malay> lockdown then <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] too bad for you [lah] but businesses wise like you said it can be a
(err) just a method [oh] [oh] a matter of adaptation and how quick you are [lah] but then also <malay>macam</malay> those traditional businesses <malay>pun macam</malay> losing out also because
they are traditional [lah] like <malay>kat kedai kopi ni semua</malay>
<malay>cik limah punya mee rebus</malay>
they actually force them to actually
(mm)
(mm)
okay [lah] I mean on the other hand <malay>pun macam</malay> you need to also see like <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu</malay>
[ah]
but I think about limitation [leh] <malay>macam</malay> like for example the reason why maybe <malay>cik limah tak pergi</malay> digital is is maybe because <malay>dia punya</malay> (um) expertise is not there then <malay>kalau</malay> she go digital <malay>pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai</malay> to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help <malay>dekat</malay> the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya [lah] but then like on her side <malay>pun macam</malay> it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
okay is okay [lah] but I think before
enforcing or like really okay [lah] enforcing <malay>macam</malay> a bit tough [lah] but like (um) pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(err)
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
(mm)
(mm)
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those (um)
underprivileged families where you are staying <malay>macam</malay> like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
(um) minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of (err) amenities for them to study which are like the laptop [lah] the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
there was also this <malay>macam</malay> article I think <malay>dekat dekat mana</malay> [eh]
the straits times or something like that <malay>yang</malay> this (um)
girl in
[ah] [ah]
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her [lah] but for like elders other younger kids [leh] then how
ya
(mm)
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
the and all these case [lah] basically <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay> wifi <malay>bukannya</malay> strong [kan] like you know you have a lot to handle
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
<malay>aku tengok kat luar tingkap</malay> [jer]
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today [lah] I think there were also reports plus (err) like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
(um)
thought of
like
okay [lah] the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
foreign worker <malay>punya</malay> dorm [kan] ya
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans [what] just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans [what] so it should be
(um)
encompass in all this care [lah]
but I think like
maybe I don't know like <malay>dia orang</malay> should probably lockdown in stages <malay>agaknya</malay> (um)
(mm)
(mm)
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the <malay>orang-orang tua</malay> who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
ya
ya even (um)
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
I mean <malay>orang tua</malay> like they probably don't have
iphone ten
it's probably just a land line <malay>dekat rumah yang</malay> ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
but more physically [lah] so
(err) that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
(mm)
no [lah] I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of [lah] I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
[oh] is it
[oh]
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on [lah]
cause I think <malay>dekat</malay> news <malay>pun ada cakap pasal</malay> the number of domestic abusers
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay [lah] I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite <malay>lepak</malay>
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
!aiyo! but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
!hais!
don't know what's gonna happen and
problem okay what do we talk about <malay>pasal</malay> societal business (err)
(mm)
I think
how can nature be a problem
no ya <malay>bukannya</malay> tracks <malay>semua ada pokok</malay>
that's
but aedes is because of <malay>air bertakung</malay> right
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay [lor] if you say so [lor]
[ah]
unless [lah] got one <malay>pokok pisang dekat</malay> in the middle of the north south line from #yew tee# to #kranji#
then there is a big issue [lah]
but I think like
<malay>ke</malay> wild boar <malay>dekat dekat</malay> #sembawang#
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
<malay>dia orang</malay> enforce the rule people will really follow <malay>apa</malay> it's like you have all those (mm) (mm)
but
ya [lah] but I still think [lah] confirm under black market so it's not that much [lah]
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything [one]
really [what]
(mm)
ya [lah] but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom [what]
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already [what]
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa benda kau bunuh</malay> lion <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that [what] they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no [lah] I think
then animal go home [lor]
take the bus [lor]
no [lah] I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
were these animals obtain [kan] and so <malay>kalau macam</malay> they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
<malay>merepek</malay> [ah]
buy one get one free
I think they kill it [leh]
remember there was this report <malay>pasal</malay> mink farm <malay>dekat mana entah</malay>
[ah]
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also [what] and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
that animals roasted already [lah] <malay>pantang</malay> #liao#
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not <malay>dia punya</malay>
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
[ah]
you have seen it before [what]
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
wait [lah] <malay>nanti dia dah besar dah</malay> [lah] <malay>letak balik kat dalam</malay>
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
<malay>hari-hari dia berdoa</malay>
should google it up the prayer plant
and (err) it's an indoor plant
(err)
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay [lah]
technically not really [eh] it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
(um)
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
[ah] [ah]
so technically <malay>dia orang punya</malay> care is quite princess [lah] they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
<malay>macam gitu kalau kau buat bodoh pun dia macam gitu</malay>
really [meh] I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it (err) refreshes the air [ah] NASA say [one]
really
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
true [lah]
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
!huh!
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves <malay>gulung</malay> like that then they will
this thing doesn't <malay>gulung</malay> [what]
shoots [ah] shoots
[oh]
okay [lah] but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
<malay>dia jadi</malay> go
<malay>dia jadi</malay> brown
I didn't know then no I never no [lah] <malay>tak jadi</malay>
<malay>jahat nah aku</malay>
okay wait [ah]
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
ya like it cannot get cold seem like <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>setakat satu malam</malay> [jer]
that is true [hor]
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong (um) so
what sort of plant got [meh]
coconut tree but it's not
<malay>daun</malay>
<malay>kau pergi jemputan mana</malay>
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
<malay>apa</malay> is standard <malay>pokok</malay>
[oh] my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
ya <malay>bodoh</malay>
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
ya so it's a very sturdy plant <malay>dia punya</malay> leaf <malay>macam</malay> like those kind of <malay>pokok pisang punya</malay> leaves but it's (err)
a bit different [lah] the milkshake
of course right cause you are not <malay>pokok pisang</malay>
ya but anyway it's quite (um) it's quite a journey
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully <malay>dia tak mati</malay>
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them (um) water the plant
they never like <malay>pakai</malay> those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the #dabao# there from container <malay>dia</malay> just scoop <malay>air gitu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay>
like it they pouring into the side [lah] not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like !wow! like that [ah]
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk [what]
<malay>sesungguhnya</malay>
scotch tap [hor] it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
pail of water and pour the plant [mah] <malay>dia pakai</malay> watering can [jer]
so I was quite amazed like [oh] okay you can actually do that
ya I mean they will say [lah] like <malay>macam kalau</malay> the top all the dry then you can water that kind [lah] <malay>bukannya hari-hari dia</malay> water the plant
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care [lah]
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
<malay>jangan beli yang menyemak punya</malay>
no one [lah] not the standard issue plan [lah] and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
(hmm)
tomorrow I got dinner
it's quite
he wants to eat #jinjja# chicken
I don't know I haven't ask him where where to go
ya
ya
then twenty fourth you all got the christmas thing going on so that's also another dinner which is probably
(err) our christmas gathering [lor] exco base
ya
like cauliflowers
right the cauliflowers
ya I'm gonna do it at scott's house
chill [lah] whatever [lah]
I mean not whatever but
at least if it's a
outside location ya true
Q I don't know that's why we need to wait for the food
it's more comfy
I haven't buy present
I got two
okay good
!hais!
what's the theme
more than thirty
[oh] I thought usually if not more than
ya that's why really helping the economy good job though
ours is
buy something that starts with S
so I'm going to buy scott but my secret santee is fanny [ah] charlotte [lah]
but
I think I want to buy each of them a smaller present just to include everyone so
for scott I went to buy a packet of salt and the glow in the dark stars sticker that one
and I'm going to give him last
then will be like don't so salty here's your present
ya then therefore shanice I'm going to buy
school supplies she's also going back to school
(err) ya [ah]
doing comms [ah]
ya she was a victim so funny like I think she's not even a year at a new place then she quit already
then she was asking me about like the school life and stuff like that then I'm like okay [lah] not bad [lah] then sense a different [lor] different vibe here
ya but she's not that far off [lah] if you think about her age and the people there
youngest in amongst us

alright alright
<malay>tak apa</malay> I think for now <malay>kita kena</malay> (err) try our best to talk to fill in the one hour ahead
yes okay so <malay>apa yang</malay> #sulaiman# Twitter <malay>macam mana nak</malay> start
okay so basically <malay>sejak dulu</malay> I've always wanted to go to the kampung <malay>nak</malay> stay the night <malay>tapi</malay> #sulaiman# <malay>dah ajak</malay> so <malay>tak dapat tidur</malay> overnight <malay>cuma setakat gi mancing</malay> overnight then <malay>aku ni</malay> expert <malay>pergi sana</malay> without any proper clothing
and (uh) the the <malay>dah jadi mangsa</malay> to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my <malay>aurat</malay>
(err) I went to the one that is nearer to to #sulaiman's# house <malay>juga</malay> [lah] it's it's just a
few walks away so it's not really much of a big distance for us to cover
<malay>kalau</malay> jetty <malay>tu jauh</malay> jetty <malay>tu</malay> is really quite a distance this [one] is <malay>yang kat belakang kampung</malay> you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then <malay>kat sana kita gi</malay> cast our rods [lah]
no that time was all the way to #jelutong# that [one] is all the way at the other end of the island <malay>yang ni betul-betul kat belakang kampung melayu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu orang melayu</malay> [kan]
ya the kampung with the malays ya that place
okay you need a best part (err) <malay>banyak petuk tapi</malay> is just <malay>yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang ikan tudung periuk</malay>
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya <malay>tapi ikan tu</malay> the story <malay>lagi</malay> best
<malay>aku dah mancing aku sengaja</malay> feel <malay>nak</malay> reel in <malay>tapi bila dah dapat</malay> [eh] <malay>tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil</malay> #sulaiman# to come and check then all of a sudden <malay>kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail</malay> [kan] <malay>betul-betul sangkut kat hidung</malay>
<malay>betul-betul</malay> on the nose
then the rest of the night <malay>tak ada ikan</malay>
<malay>betul-betul potong</malay>
<malay>kita jumpa dekat</malay> singapore so the the <malay>asal</malay> before <malay>kita jumpa sekeluarga</malay>
then <malay>dia datang naik</malay> grab <malay>bila dia</malay> claw grab <malay>ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa</malay>
<malay>betul-betul keluar barang</malay> one by one <malay>ada</malay> claw back trolley <malay>besar satu bakul satu</malay> (err) <malay>bawa langsir</malay>
<malay>nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia</malay> then actually the next day more fun <malay>keluarga dia datang</malay> the next day <malay>dia nya</malay> extended relatives [lah] <malay>dia datang bawa tiga</malay>
no [lah] I think for them maybe is about
connections [lah] <malay>kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya</malay> family <malay>yang dia punya</malay> extended family <malay>ni memang satu orang tu</malay> driver so <malay>kalau</malay> coincidentally <malay>dia dapat</malay> arrange with the driver <malay>senang</malay> [lah] <malay>tak payah bayar tambang</malay> free of charge
okay so <malay>kita dah sampai kampung</malay> #sulaiman# get everything ready six o'clock then <malay>salin baju semua</malay>
(err) that's what made me worried [lah] <malay>tengok dia dah pakai</malay> all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then <malay>terus</malay>
initially no intention <malay>tapi bila dah nampak</malay> #sulaiman# <malay>keluarkan joran tu</malay> the intention came out [lah]
okay so six get already then after that we (err)
six twenty five <malay>kita gerak</malay> then from there <malay>kita jalan</malay> all the way to that spot
(err) until six thirty five then
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually <malay>macam</malay> where you get all the <malay>air keluar masuk</malay> then <malay>bila air pasang semua macam</malay> marina barrage [lah] and then you get on top of the stone then #sulaiman# <malay>cakap</malay> #wan# (err) <malay>ni</malay> part <malay>gerek</malay> [tau] <malay>bila</malay> high tide <malay>kita tak boleh keluar</malay> [tau]
<malay>kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap</malay> go [jer] [ah] don't scared then <malay>betul-betul bila</malay> high tide [eh] <malay>terus</malay> #sulaiman# pointed at me #wan# <malay>tengok terus kita dah</malay> surrounded <malay>kiri kanan air pasang besar</malay>
then at first <malay>macam mula-mula tak boleh</malay> understand [lah] like the the depth of the <malay>air tapi bila air surut</malay>
once you see that low tide <malay>dia punya</malay> drop from the top of the dam to the bottom <malay>seram</malay> [sia] <malay>dua dua tingkat</malay> yes
so <malay>macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul</malay> because of that that (err) concrete structure <malay>bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam</malay> [seh]
yes
ya so basically <malay>macam</malay> this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path <malay>yang kita kena jalan atas</malay>
then (err) <malay>ada</malay> from there is like a hill downwards [lah] so from there <malay>ada</malay> slope to (err) to <malay>bakau-bakau sini</malay> and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so <malay>bila air pasang</malay>
the whole valley below <malay>semua ni semua</malay> covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest [eh]
<malay>betul-betul macam sini</malay> [tau] then <malay>dia cakap man kalau</malay> get any higher how <malay>aku cakap macam tu</malay> [lah] #wan#
<malay>takde</malay> there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm <malay>kau try juga</malay> high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours (err) because
<malay>air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh</malay> but the coast too low then after that we were there until
<malay>pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam</malay> ya then after that <malay>pukul satu</malay>
<malay>tu apa</malay> was the highest then after that <malay>betul-betul tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> literally [sia]
<malay>macam</malay> tsunami <malay>betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam</malay>
<malay>tak juga</malay> okay <malay>itu</malay> best okay this part censored <malay>sikit</malay> <malay>bila nak kencing kita ada satu</malay> spot
<malay>satu</malay> spot on the whole man-made structure <malay>kita</malay> technically I will consider this <malay>macam</malay> the north eastern part of it
away from the <malay>laut tapi</malay> towards the kampung
<malay>habis tu ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> #rilek# <malay>terus dengar ada kat belakang</malay> what what's that noise <malay>jangan pandang belakang</malay> [oh]
censored ya so #sulaiman# was there to pee [lah] then after that (err) not long after that [lah] my turn my turn because for us there's nothing much to do so all we do is go up there
drink lots of water so #sulaiman# will have a sweeter taste because he
drank lemon tea I I brought my dasani and then we just drink drink drink and for #sulaiman# he only peed once I peed
two three times because there's nothing much to do but #sulaiman# what he did most was he he <malay>makan</malay> some Pringles [lah]
enjoy the enjoy
okay so #sulaiman# <malay>dia dia tunjuk</malay> something this [one] is about #naz# <malay>yang</malay> recommend
<malay>dia ada satu</malay> backpack <malay>ni dia jadi tempat duduk</malay>
<malay>kirakan macam</malay> backpack <malay>punya</malay> the the sponge <malay>tu dia punya</malay> padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that #sulaiman# just <malay>duduk</malay> [jer] <malay>atas</malay>
but for my end <malay>ini tempat</malay> legend <malay>aku tak ada benda</malay> then (um) #sulaiman# <malay>punya</malay> mum <malay>cakap</malay> #wan# (err) <malay>kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak</malay>
then I I I find this <malay>yang</malay> the simple basic students <malay>yang lipat yang buka tutup</malay> boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then <malay>kita</malay> testing <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>kat kampung tapi bila kita</malay> testing [kan] <malay>mesti nak kena</malay> fragile <malay>sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi</malay> the whole boat collapsed
ya

(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
#ish# #ish# (mm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] mine mine I I wear arm sleeves you can't see but it's it's poking through [lah] poking through
#ish# #ish# of course not nice
but okay in terms of <malay>azan</malay> [eh] because this [one] also the same thing happened to me that time when I go with #sulaiman# but the the thing is (uh) not the spot but basically in the <malay>kampung melayu juga</malay> when we are back at home it was <malay>betul-betul subuh</malay> time [lah]
then when I was outside I thought like somebody was you know playing on the radio <malay>azan</malay> or <malay>quran</malay>
but then when I go outside I literally stand in the middle <malay>semua gelap</malay> I just stand in the middle and then I faced towards malaysia [lah] then I can really hear <malay>surau kat sana tengah</malay> playing [eh] <malay>tengah</malay> playing <malay>pula</malay> [eh] <malay>tengah tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> prepare <malay>tengah solat subuh</malay>
then for the first time <malay>macam</malay> the whole <malay>kampung betul-betul</malay> every <malay>subuh</malay> [eh] I think this [one] has to be like every day [ah] everyday in #pulau ubin# <malay>ada</malay> [jer] <malay>quran</malay> playing
so there's always <malay>quran</malay> throughout the whole island <malay>boleh dengar</malay> because <malay>kampung</malay> it's from malaysia [lah] you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably <malay>memang</malay> isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the <malay>surau</malay> if I'm not mistaken is the <malay>masjid kampung</malay> #pasir puteh#
so white sands literally <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia ya then that <malay>masjid</malay> is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area #pulau ketam# should hear it louder than <malay>kampung melayu</malay>
three three testing [ah] sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
and ya [lah] so <malay>yang</malay> okay so <malay>yang</malay> #pulau ketam# is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see [ah] (uh huh) [ah]
[oh] the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of #pulau ketam# from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in [lah] maybe a place I've never been in before [lah]
(oo) that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to #punggol# to already
[orh] !aduh! so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
<malay>ikan besar</malay>
[oh] here comes the big one and (uh) instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your #pulau ubin# story thank you so almost for sharing
(err) time check this [one] I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually (err) after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot [lah] I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit [lah] ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
[lah] [kan] [lah] [kan] [eh] yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months [ah] [ah]
okay so for now the same thing [lah] just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for (err) I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being (err) more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on [lah]
I think slowly [lah] [eh] because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed [lah] I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more [lah] ya so just (err) pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
(err) with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then #inshallah# when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck [lah] then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that (err) it's just whether or not approve or not if approve I #alhamdullilah# I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it [lah] if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application [lah]
(err) !wah! cannot I cannot think that means a lot already [lah]
(err)
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've (err) sent for has been
(err) civil service (err) healthcare (err) cleaning (err)
around those [lah] is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call [lah]
ya <malay>kenapa</malay> [seh] <malay>mana ada</malay>
<malay>tadi</malay> in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
<malay>campurkan melayu sikit</malay> with the english but when I try to put in the <malay>melayu</malay> I understand that I hesitate a bit <malay>jadi terkaku</malay> [lah]
<malay>habis bila dah</malay> focused then (err) then all the sentence everywhere
<malay>jadi kita</malay> try our best to not really mix everything [lah] cause that's that's against what they want us to do [pe]
ya [lah] so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
[ah] yes <malay>ada kisahnya</malay> all
the rejection is the best part [ah] silence which is the most annoying part because technically [eh] by right the most professional way for is
<malay>kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang</malay> [jer] [lah] but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this [one] I can say [lah] because I think one month <malay>dah</malay> over <malay>pun</malay>
(err) I applied for this (err) safe distancing (err) ambassador at <malay>masjid</malay> #omar salmah#
at caldecott area there (err) more of central macritchie [lah] macritchie reservoir [ah] so it's there
so that [one] is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most <malay>yang kasi harapan</malay> because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum <malay>terpinga-pinga</malay> [lah] <malay>macam ni nak bayar ni</malay>
ya ya then for me I was (err) I just answer the call then <malay>cakap</malay> hi (err) #assalamualaikum# (err) (err) is this #shazwan# on the line
then I <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] yes may I know who is this <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] I am from <malay>masjid</malay> #muhajirin# <malay>mula-mula aku fikir aku</malay> apply <malay>masjid</malay> #omar salmah# <malay>asal</malay> why is it <malay>yang masjid</malay> #muhajirin# <malay>yang</malay> call
then I realise [ah] because (err) this thing is by right <malay>ada</malay> #muhajirin# but they need someone to (err) cover #omar salmah# so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then <malay>aku</malay> explain to them [lah] <malay>yang</malay> okay <malay>aku ni dua puluh empat tahun</malay>
then (err) then
she ask the question <malay>tahu ke tak yang</malay> this place is very far very <malay>ulu ada</malay> transports <malay>sendiri ke tak</malay> then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes [lah]
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that (err) we'll just keep in touch (err) within the week we'll call you back
within the week so <malay>sekarang dah satu bulan</malay>
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing [eh] like like at least <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the <malay>rezeki</malay> I've been waiting for ya <malay>ke tak</malay> it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
(err) with every passing day (err) when the doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish [lah] like are you just playing my feelings want to play my feelings [ah] playing my heart
(err) it's not it's <malay>tak baik</malay> [lah] <malay>tak baik</malay>
I think I think I think that [one] is the worst [lah] okay so to talk about <malay>sakit hati</malay> this [one] I don't know if if <malay>kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib</malay> because it it it involves <malay>masjid juga</malay>
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the <malay>masjid</malay>
but I will say the proximity of the <malay>masjid</malay> the <malay>masjid</malay> is in the east so this <malay>masjid</malay> he surrounding <malay>dia</malay> has quite a few other #masjids#
[ah]
yes so this is a part of singapore <malay>yang ada banyak masjid</malay> quite near each other [ah] if you knows what I'm talking about
so
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the <malay>masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit</malay> okay it's one it's definitely <malay>tak tak</malay> famous [lah] which is why <malay>lagi aku</malay> fed up
so okay so basically (err)
the whole story is <malay>yang mula-mula</malay> I got this call from this (err) person from I would say the communications department [lah]
[kan] so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying (um) #assalamualaikum# #shazwan# (err) <malay>saya</malay> #nik# <malay>ni</malay> (err)
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind <malay>siapa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni terus cakap</malay> since when am I helping to design a poster
then
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like (err) we are urgent [lah] urgent can you help us in my mind <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>aku tak cakap benda</malay> I didn't I didn't want to be on board <malay>tapi</malay> the way you say <malay>macam kesian juga ini masjid</malay>
ya so so that's the story [lah] the middle person (err)
(err) eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just <malay>mentang-mentang kasi</malay> my
my number to this (err) communications officer [lah] then (err) after that
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me [lah] my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then <malay>bila aku dah buat semua</malay> they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the #asatizahs# mentioned then <malay>aku fikir aku memang</malay> [lah] <malay>bukan orang alim</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> who are these <malay>ustaz</malay> I don't know these <malay>ustaz</malay> what if I type the same <malay>ustaz</malay> and I put <malay>ustaz nama nama ustaz</malay> different person I wouldn't know also [what]
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend [lah] <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun</malay> by right <malay>macam orang masjid</malay> [lah]
and he he managed to provide me <malay>yang gambar-gambar betul</malay> [lah] so #alhamdullilah# so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature [lah] basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the <malay>asatizah</malay> and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
is #fandi ahmad# #fandi ahmad#
yes so so that's why I say this <malay>masjidnya sebab apa</malay>
<malay>ada pula panggil</malay> #fandi ahmad# so I already did the design (err) I understand that the communications officer <malay>sebenarnya dia orang muda</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> actually understand my style <malay>dia pun suka</malay> my style but of course <malay>kita akhirnya</malay> when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then (err)
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say (um) <malay>aku rasa ada</malay> problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
so by right even for me [lah] when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event <malay>kita selalu</malay> moderator <malay>dulu</malay> you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint <malay>juga</malay> I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the #asatizahs# together
and then I got #fandi ahmad# but the person who viewed this thing said (err) do you think it might be offensive to the <malay>asatizah</malay> that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind <malay>aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke</malay> is that is that healthy for you to say [eh] <malay>aku lebih alim</malay> [pe] is that actually healthy <malay>sangat</malay>
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment [lah] so okay (err) I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then <malay>asatizah</malay> and then #fandi ahmad# would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say [eh] if I <malay>macam tu</malay> I I put circle <malay>pun</malay> you will find somewhere to start <malay>semua mesti salah punya</malay> right
then (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
you know because for my for me (err) the the thing is me and this (err) officer
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen <malay>ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda</malay> so the explanation is okay but I still feel [ah] that's it that's it so once that happens
(err) game [lah] so I I really at that time <malay>memang macam</malay> upset [lah] but the [oh] the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman <malay>cakap</malay> okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight <malay>dia pun bilang aku</malay> that timing and then after that the next day <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> the officer called me
[eh] not call [lah] Whatsapp me say [eh] sorry #shazwan# we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
that the pictures of <malay>asatizah</malay> are made into cartoons and then ya !alah! I <malay>fikir</malay>
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger <malay>ke telinga besar ke</malay> is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the <malay>asatizah</malay> drawn as a cartoon then <malay>aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat</malay>
ya so that's why in this <malay>situasi</malay> you can actually see
that <malay>orang tua</malay> is not very flexible they understand everything then
(err) so the officer said
I really apologise for this thing (um) <malay>boleh tak</malay>
(err) <malay>kita</malay> delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the <malay>asatizah</malay> in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces <malay>buat cantik-cantik</malay> bring it bigger make the font smaller
<malay>semua tu</malay> means nothing [lah] he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
<malay>cakap</malay> we know of someone who can help us for free [ah] without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why <malay>bila aku dah</malay> [tau] <malay>dah</malay> find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was <malay>panas</malay> I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said (err) <malay>salam semua</malay> this is the poster that I have done
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say [lah] (err) it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
<malay>nanti tiba-tiba</malay> [jer] <malay>nama dah masuk dalam</malay> for <malay>benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat</malay>
[ah] <malay>memang</malay> so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
<malay>yang mereka masih</malay> persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to (err) <malay>macam tukar</malay> (err) <malay>pemikiran orang-orang atas</malay> [lah]
<malay>cakap</malay> to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature <malay>tapi kita pun nak kena tengok</malay> logic [tau] the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you (err)
secondary school [lah] <malay>kau tengok gambar macam</malay> comic and <malay>gambar macam</malay> real <malay>mana satu yang kau macam</malay> more !wah! this [one] seems more interesting
ya [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya
ya [lah] so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
so <malay>itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia</malay> communication in the beginning <malay>pun tak kasi</malay> [tau] they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then <malay>betul-betul cakap</malay> I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then <malay>terpaksa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita</malay> forgive
<malay>tapi</malay> when they start saying [oh] by the way #shazwan# (err) can you just put the original picture [ah] that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair <malay>juga</malay> [lah] if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing <malay>memang</malay> unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced <malay>ikhlas ke tak ikhlas</malay> so
that's the that's the sad part [lah] which is why it reminded me of the of the time <malay>yang dulu</malay>
<malay>kita ni kalau buat</malay> design <malay>ni</malay> freelance never do for free
that's why (mm) yes (mm)
the video [lah] [kan] the video
(uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
[ah] !aduh!
(mm) <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes <malay>macam</malay> for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment <malay>cakap kalau senang senang kau buat</malay> [lah] <malay>sendiri</malay> what you mean so easy do yourself
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense [lah] because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
(err) no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
then okay <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati</malay>
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings (err) time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will
say our goodbyes alright I hope
(err) even for you (err) folks over there that is listening in that is tuning into our (err) podcast <malay>terima kasih</malay>

today is not we today we cannot say
(err) <malay>malam jumaat malam jumaat</malay> is thursday so the logic [eh] if you you if you're curious is that <malay>sebab kita</malay>
(err) we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
so <malay>maghrib</malay> is when we start our day so that's why for <malay>hari raya</malay> [ah] if you are also curious why we don't (err) fast

at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning [oh] damn
so yes (err) these are all the topics that we like to discuss you know we've been talking with each other but !hey! you are a
listener
ya now <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>merepek tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kita asyik berbual</malay> for forty eight minutes straight [kan] these things will pop up I'm pretty sure we are not the only
(err) people the only participants <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>bual benda-benda merepek</malay> especially towards the the later part of this (err)
podcast (err) I wanted to say project which is the thing [lah] but for us we gonna treat it as podcast already [lah] <malay>kita betul-betul tak tahu nak bual apa</malay> [lah] [kan]

(mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
I want to say that's what they do but to be honest I only saw the ad on Facebook they say pay eighteen dollars per hour work from home I like
cause ya [lah] we we understand that through the trial we have to go through the trial first if we are successful then we can talk about the next step [lah] like we said as malay
when it comes to the next steps we need to know what's the next step if it's a little bit too much <malay>takpe</malay> thank you
it's been very simple but I think when it comes to the singlish accent will be quite
tricky on our end because for us being malays we will always have the #mat-mat# accent
but the #mat-mat# accent but I think
should be okay [lah] because you wanted singlish singlish is basically (err) <malay>orang bangsa macam-macam bual bahasa macam-macam</malay> together #rojak# and then that's that's our language our pride and honour
pride <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> record <malay>lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>dah tutup</malay>

I don't know how to say but I feel like it's further
close change the last part
<malay>apa kamu cakap</malay> change the last part again yes
I walk from my house I cut through #bedok# I reach east coast park I walk along the whole east coast park reach the gardens by the bay
<malay>aku pun tak tahu berapa</malay> click basically that then go down marina barrage gardens by the bay marina bay sands five one eight <malay>balik rumah tidur</malay>
I usually go out at five <malay>asar</malay> five <malay>sampai balik rumah</malay> nine thirty
[eh] you underestimate my stamina <malay>ke</malay> brother I walk from from my house to east coast one hour

(err) <malay>orang yang orang yang apa itu membersihkan</malay>

<malay>menggunakan</malay> (uh) vacuum special
I think <malay>beliau bercakap</malay>

I <malay>picit loceng yang itu</malay>
no [lah] you not my waiter <malay>tapi</malay>
you are my (uh) private
cook
ya (uh) I will buy all the ingredient
and then (uh) I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter (um)
you want a you want to put like a (uh) you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
(uh) the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because [ah] ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better [lah] because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and (uh) moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food [lah]
ya
and then
ya
so you <malay>hari itu</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>kita kena tengok</malay>
(uh) <malay>harga</malay> quotation <malay>itu berapa</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack <malay>ke</malay> or

(mm)
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
(uh) multiple attempt to
(uh) kill them
they (uh) they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
(uh) it (uh) spraying the the lizard repellents (uh) spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too [lah] the our our house here I think
(uh) the it's there's a lot of (uh) lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient [ah] even though I've tried to to to hit them [ah] is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
[oh] my god so (uh) I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
[ah]
is what <malay>kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil</malay>
<malay>sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan rumah kita macam</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia pandai</malay> [tau] <malay>dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak</malay> (err)

<malay>dengan</malay> (err) <malay>apa itu</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> spray spray <malay>pencuci lantai semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan</malay>
<malay>tahi-tahi itu tapi kadang-kadang kita pun</malay>
(err) <malay>letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi</malay>
<malay>kita kadang-kadang kita tangguh</malay>
<malay>kita tangguh</malay>
time <malay>kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai</malay>
<malay>berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang</malay> is (err) <malay>isteri</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>isteri kalau</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu dia akan</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti apa isteri akan buat</malay> [kan]
(err)
ya
ya
<malay>memang</malay> (uh) ya [lah] I understand [lah] your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time [lah] it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners (uh) I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity [lah] it's a it's a need [lah] more of a need
necessity because everything has (err) you know
wears down you know
and (uh) our our kitchen looks quite dirty and (uh) rundown and (uh)
our our the (uh) you call it the flooring starts to (uh) wears down
[ah] ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and (uh) they feature a few (uh) [lah] but (uh) so far three D contractors (uh) in terms of
the the the outcome [ah] it it it suits our taste [ah]
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
[eh] very nice [lah] we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but (uh) ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that (uh)
the kitchen the kitchen <malay>apa itu</malay>
not not not the sink [ah] kitchen tap
quite a few [lah] and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus [oh] one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
who halfway (uh) <malay>merajuk</malay> and don't want to come
to finish off the [ah]
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
!aiya!
ya [lah] <malay>dia dia ini</malay>
I don't know [lah] it's both it is both (uh) frustrating and funny at the same time [eh]
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then (err)
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
you know like <malay>malas-malas</malay> to to come
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
(uh)
self guilt [lah] I think so I don't know [lah]
so emotional then <malay>merajuk</malay>
ya
cement
[oh]
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship [lah]
ya
ya the was
(uh) ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him [lah] probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain [oh] ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery [lah] but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
(mm) ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare [lah] how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how [lah]
which one we we want to choose
ya <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>bilang</malay> you [lah] (uh) (err) <malay>kita kasi dia orang</malay> arrange
<malay>kita kasi</malay> arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita kita pun</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay> will markup
or work <malay>kita punya</malay> budget so <malay>kita kasi</malay> them
arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so
(mm)
ya
actually ya [lah] <malay>macam lampu ini semua kita dah</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita dia punya</malay> cost <malay>itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi</malay> [ah]
(uh) <malay>banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga</malay> [lah] <malay>kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga</malay>
<malay>tukar lampu</malay>
so I mean <malay>sekarang ini yang</malay> the more <malay>yang lebih</malay>
major major [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana berapa dia orang akan</malay> quote
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) the the other time I I I
I <malay>tanya</malay> quotation ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> toilet <malay>itu kalau dua</malay> toilet
<malay>kurang-kurang pun</malay> at least <malay>satu</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> at least maybe three four K
<malay>dua</malay> toilet is around <malay>lapan</malay> K just toilet
[kan]
one (uh) so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package [ah]
[oh]
<malay>itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk</malay> kitchen <malay>dapur bahagian sana</malay> [lah] <malay>sekaligus</malay> [ah]
ya
[kan] might as well [kan]
<malay>nak berhabuk biar berhabuk terus</malay>
<malay>tak yang yang bilik tak yang</malay> master bedroom vinyl <malay>kita</malay> almost thousand
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
thousand four thousand [ah] <malay>seribu lima seribu</malay>
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
<malay>datang</malay>
<malay>apa yang bilik bilik</malay> master <malay>kita nak buka</malay>
<malay>nak buka buat apa</malay>
<malay>agaknya</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau nak</malay> ya [lah] <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> I <malay>murah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>leceh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>bayar lebih sikit biar</malay> the <malay>biar yang yang yang</malay> the experts
do it
<malay>nanti minta siapa nanti sendiri yang nanti</malay>
ya <malay>tapi bilik ini dia punya</malay> flooring
<malay>kena tukar juga</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
yes <malay>dia sejuk panas sejuk panas</malay> [ha] <malay>tengok ini dah merekah</malay> [lah]
that <malay>yang yang</malay>
<malay>dia merekah nanti jadi macam</malay> [ah] master bedroom [ah] <malay>sebelum sebelum itu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam masuk air semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti itu dah sebab</malay> <malay>sebelah</malay>
<malay>sebelah</malay> toilet <malay>itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah</malay>
<malay>sampai menggelembung</malay> [eh]
<malay>ini ini bukan</malay> ya <malay>ini bukan yang</malay>
I don't think this the <malay>ini</malay> vinyl <malay>yang</malay>
so so so <malay>tengok</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> master bedroom we do it around <malay>berapa</malay> [eh] thousand
okay [lah] thousand five [ah] [eh]
so <malay>kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin</malay>
[oh] <malay>mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya</malay> estimate <malay>nya</malay>
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>kita pun kita punya</malay> budget <malay>pun tak banyak</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita buat yang yang</malay> urgent <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
<malay>sejuk</malay> [ah]
so I think ya [lah]
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in (uh) (uh) in the future we have (uh)
<malay>kalau ada ada</malay> baby <malay>baru ke</malay> so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety <malay>dia tak keras sangat</malay>
<malay>kalau jatuh pun</malay> at least <malay>dia ada macam</malay> (uh) cushion this vinyl [kan] underneath <malay>dia ada</malay> cushion [kan]
then <malay>tak sejuk sangat</malay>
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
[ah]
ya
kitchen <malay>punya</malay> flooring
<malay>yang yang</malay> I I saw one of the picture you send
send me the one
with the kitchen <malay>punya</malay>
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring [ah]
I think that [one] is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that [one] the the more expensive one
(mm)
but have to
you have to ya [lah] everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
but (uh) ya the one that we saw <malay>kak</malay> #doro# using I think !wah!
if we have the the budget can consider [lah] I think that one's quite expensive is around
!wah! but I find it like very good [leh]
and it's wireless
(mm)
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
(uh) brands (uh)
(uh) have that those type of (uh) two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that [one] very good [ah] (uh) I think
can can consider [lah] if we have the means
but now we !aiya! we see how for now we just use manually first [ah]
use the sucking mop [ah]
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
(uh) sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive [ah]
ya that [one] really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence [ah] because like I told you earlier on
(err) ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence [lah]
ya
(mm)
the specific (uh) ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
[ah] ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well [lah]
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
(mm)
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally [lah] ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya [lah] like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) I think this saturday we we settle (uh) #akid's# (uh) school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare #akid# (uh) school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
(uh) the the the the renovation [ah]
(mm) so actually we K we we need to ya [lah] we ours we we are the one who should
direct them [oh] we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration [ah]
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but [ah] ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

between good looks and a fit body right I would go for their credit card
that's the only only reason why you should be very
no I think
no I think good looks also I feel like good looks is more more sustainable
if you're superficial
if you're superficial
ya
ya I think after awhile you will get tired of looking at a person's body
I don't know think face is like more more personal and like more adoring right

so you make a place for yourself
that's why should be free
#yishun#
island [eh] !wow!
[oh]
(uh) what's the island what's the island by #punggol# called [ah]
you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by #punggol# I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night
it's only open in the day I forgot what it's called [lah]

agaknya agaknya apa lembu tu nak kena sembelih</malay> or something <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay> family member like one of the family members is like no I love this cow let's brought over to that the island
I guess what happened
[oh] wait but I mean how old can how how old can the <malay>lembu</malay> be [sia]
I think I was thinking that like
in a situation where <malay>kampung</malay> is still
present you know and then like they need so many <malay>lembu</malay>
I mean like nobody care less somebody's <malay>lembu</malay>
#kampong glam#
!wah! serious [ah] [oh] I think I heard of that
[oh] <malay>kau</malay> film <malay>kat sana</malay>

(mm)
<malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [sia]
ya
but
were they trying to colonize area
<malay>ada ramai orang tinggal sana</malay> [eh]
[orh]
then <malay>dia orang kerja apa</malay> [seh]
but is it like a relatively close to like the surrounding flats
!wah! that's cool
(mm)
<malay>tempat dia besar</malay>
!wah!
that's really nice [eh] I want I want to move there [sia]
I want to go visit
I want to visit
but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big [ah]
the place
[orh] [orh]
[orh] so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside [ah]
then <malay>waktu tu dah dah malam</malay> [eh]
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
<malay>nampak apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>nampak muka kau</malay>
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone [ah]
I mean alone with her friends
(um) <malay>yang dia boleh nampak</malay>
singapore <malay>ada tempat apa lagi yang</malay>
all the nature reserves [lor]
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun
think that's why they normally go at like seven eight so
ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near #mandai# area there it's like a hidden
hidden <malay>bukit</malay> I think
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
<malay>habis sini</malay> #mandai# also so if you're bored you can just go next door [ah] see
<malay>monyet</malay>
yes
actually I don't know [eh]
the animals all wear masks
the features [ah]
[oh] ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
and then and then join the let them join <malay>lembu</malay> in <malay>pulau</malay>
#pulau semakau# the place coney island
ya
[oh] ya [sia] I think I think last time <malay>aku pergi</malay> zoo [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] maybe like <malay>tiga tahun yang lepas</malay>
can't remember
ya I mean compared to you [lah]
I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something [kan]
thing is three years is quite okay [lah] [kan]
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures
it's like
as in the big cats [lah]
they just like pacing around
cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure
then they just walking back and forth
just like restless
they should be free
it's still around right
[oh] ya
I forgot [ah]
<malay>kesian</malay> old age right they said
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
[oh] ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from #yishun#
you never went
!huh!
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four [ah]
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
timing <malay>dia</malay> quite risky
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
[orh]
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what !huh!
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and #changi# airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on #changi# airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
!hais!
<malay>kalau kalau kau ada tiga</malay> wishes <malay>kau nak kau nak</malay> wish <malay>apa</malay>
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be (uh) happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
[oh] shit
genie
you [eh] what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
!huh!
[oh] never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay [lah] I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
[ah]
what would I want
[ah]
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
(uh)
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
[oh] my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long [eh] from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
how different it will be if we <malay>apa</malay> we never had COVID
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
[oh] shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
[oh] ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
[oh] ya and that as well
(uh huh)
[oh] ya
I think you like got scanned use your and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the code is already enough [what]
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay [ah]
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all [lah] but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
[ah]
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah] <malay>kucing</malay>

wild cats
!oops!
<malay>kesian</malay>
sometimes I like my bed I'm like
[ah] I know what would be better me lying with a cat
just like cuddling
ya it is like sitting in a chair
ya
I think she's like
also like very
(uh) she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now [eh]
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy
now
last time I don't have it now it's like very sensitive
it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
<malay>batuk</malay>
then <malay>sekarang dah dah</malay> okay [ah]
[oh] ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya
but he had fun
ya I guess I mean he's he's not really like scared of it right is he
like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do [lah]
(mm) ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
(uh) human civilizations will be like
(uh)
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example [lah] then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like (uh) like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
(uh) issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
[oh] no [lah] like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff [lah] like taking care
(uh) like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
just <malay>berhenti</malay> in all of the seven hundred languages
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like [ah] I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like (uh) like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
you should just you should just go up there and then you just say <malay>kalau kau orang semua</malay> stop [ah] stop it
<malay>kau orang semua sekarang</malay>
<malay>hentikan ini semua</malay>
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
[oh] yes yes yes
[oh] ya <malay>merepek gila</malay> [sia]
that's so sad
<malay>kalau itu kalau kawan aku yang aku</malay> confirm <malay>macam sedih</malay> [sia]
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
to <malay>bunuh</malay>
if I was the judge I would say that
just
<malay>kau hentikan sekarang pembunuh</malay>
[oh] ya that's like really
[oh] why

no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because [kan]
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day [what]
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous (uh) homework [lah]
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no [meh]
it's like
okay for example [eh] you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember [what]
until now I still do that
[ah] [lah] primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle

I never really got a difference between having good looks and a fit body so personally which one will you
prefer
honestly I feel like good looks is <malay>macam</malay>
genetic [ah] like <malay>kalau</malay> your parents
are good looking then
you <malay>macam</malay>
you lucky [ah]
cause you because
I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
you will get you will
good looks <malay>bukan benda yang</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> work for but fit body is
you can train you can exercise and you can get there
you get what I mean
so to me it's like I would I would prefer good looks
just because
<malay>dia tak boleh dapat</malay> any other way
(um)
okay [lah] (err) I mean
make sense [oh] going off of that
(err)
I <malay>pun nak tanya</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
because you were saying like [oh] live a long live long life and stuff like that right
then
I was just thinking about it like the other day
cause (err) I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay <malay>kalau tak salah</malay>
then like
<malay>dia orang</malay>
(err)
you know how the emphasis is all about the environment there right so it's like there were some like (um)
note notes [lah] about (err) extinction and all that stuff
then I was wondering how would you how do you think that humans will eventually become extinct
because <malay>macam</malay>
we we will go extinct the question is how and when
that that that last point that you made
you know I (err)
I <malay>baru baru-baru ni</malay> I <malay>main apa tu</malay>
you know the game plague
the one where like you spread the virus and stuff
<malay>abeh</malay>
I I <malay>main</malay> [kan] then I noticed [ah]
how easy it was to like spread a virus in the world
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang nak pergi nak nak</malay> fly back <malay>dari</malay> like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>kalau kita orang</malay> (err)
<malay>kalau</malay>
(um)
<malay>kalau manusia nak</malay>
<malay>kalau manusia</malay> were to be extinct right
then I <malay>rasa</malay>
the the the
most likely way would be <malay>dari</malay> viruses <malay>macam</malay> COVID [lah] that kind cause we are so
we're so interconnected [lah] it's it's to the point where
we are moving around too much
not to say is bad because it's just
<malay>macam dunia ni dah macam gitu tapi</malay>
at the same time it's like too much of a good thing isn't good [lah]
that kind of thing
so
like if you think about it
there are like a lot of viruses in
africa
but
you never ever really hear about them <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>tak ada banyak orang yang pergi</malay> africa
if we <malay>tapi kalau</malay>
if and when the day comes that people end up a lot more people end up (um)
going to africa to like visit <malay>ke apa</malay>
then
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places <malay>tapi</malay> like if you also see right
africa <malay>pun dia orang punya</malay> COVID cases not very high
partly because they are used to it
they are used to like this kind of thing so genetically and also government wise they know how to handle it
but then the rest of us we live in like relatively cleaner relatively more like virus free places
so <malay>kita orang tak
<malay>tak</malay> prepared [lah] <malay>kira</malay>
ya so I feel like that would be the one way that we would all be extinct
you know that that
I <malay>faham</malay> I <malay>faham</malay>
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>tu tu</malay> okay <malay>tu kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> population <malay>turun</malay> [kan]
in my in my opinion [ah]
the world gets better in a sense <malay>pasal</malay>
the the one problem that we're facing now is <malay>terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup</malay> (err) <malay>tak cukup</malay> resources <malay>macam</malay> you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
(err) too many wants not enough resources
like we want too many things [lah] but
if let's say we have
like like the population goes down to a more to a lower rate I feel like that would be better for us and also for the earth
you get what I mean
so in a way unless like if yes our <malay>kita orang punya</malay> population <malay>turun</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay> like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct <malay>pasal</malay> there will come a point where
we will be like [eh]
<malay>dah cukup</malay> like now we finally have enough
food and water and all that stuff so now we can
build back up and all that
that's in my opinion [ah] I don't know
but ya
but to be fair I feel like humans are quite resilient it will be a bit hard for us to go extinct
okay but then
(err)
enough with that deep stuff
[ah] this one is
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> (err)
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh dapat tiga</malay> skill
<malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>apa-apa</malay> skill [lah] you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> skill <malay>yang mungkin</malay> you <malay>pilih</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah]
realistic kind supernatural no supernatural later that one is superpower no no
realistic realistic
so <malay>kira</malay> like you you can you play soccer so <malay>kira</malay> maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
that's what I mean
any kind of skill [lah] like any life skill don't need to be specific to soccer or anything
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
okay
I feel like
you <malay>punya</malay>
second skill is basically about managing stress right
that that's the best way to put it right
then your first one would be
confidence
confidence in public speaking
then your last one is
(err) let me go by one to three (err) first one is confident speaking
second one is managing stress
third one is (um)
<malay>apa</malay> third one <malay>tadi</malay>
okay [lah] I feel like that <malay>yang yang</malay> the last one is
the hardest of all the three
okay let me give you mine first mine would be
first one would definitely be managing stress like that one in this world
you you <malay>tak boleh</malay> manage stress <malay>you</malay> are done
ya
in in my in my opinion [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
exam school
just general life stress and all that
if you cannot handle it then you're done for [lah] especially if since you play sports you know
it's like the anxiety before some people get
personally right
I know people who get like adrenaline
because I run like competitively so I <malay>rasa macam ada orang yang</malay>
(err)
<malay>yang yang yang</malay> very
very pumped up very excited
<malay>nak nak pergi dia orang suka</malay> competition <malay>macam gini</malay> and all that stuff
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> I [kan] <malay>suka</malay> competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part [lah]
but to me is like
it's it's a bit more challenging because
you go for competition then you are nervous and then
you are worried you start thinking about all the different scenarios and all that stuff
and
like
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you [dah] <malay>kerja dah dah dah dah</malay> train [dah] work very hard for it
so there's no there's no really any need there's not really any need [lah] to be very nervous and all that stuff
so that would be that one skill that I would want that ability to
manage the stress manage the anxiety like before an important thing or anything [lah] that kind cause to me in general day to day life I feel like I'm okay
like I'm not very stressful over everything
but when I feel like I've worked some people gain confidence because they know that they work very very hard for something right but then to me it's more it's more like the more I work for something
the more I feel nervous because
like I put in so much effort already I put in so much time
and then if I mess up now is like !wah! all that time wasted all that effort gone
you know
so
ya
that's that's that's that one that's that one skill that I would want
and then number two would be
!wah! actually
I mean if if okay
one one skill would be probably
ya [lah] I will the the second skill I will relate it to my running
like
I mean naturally [lah] I would want to be running I would want to like have that ability to run like all those top runners and all that stuff like ya
that's that's the one that I can think of because
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> physical [jer] <malay>tapi</malay>
also <malay>dari segi</malay> mental
<malay>boleh tolong</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan]
the the better you get at something
the more confidence you have in yourself
so the more secure you are about who you are like okay
no matter what fails like no matter how bad I am at something I know at at the very least okay this is something that I'm solid at
so <malay>kalau kira</malay> I <malay>tengah buat</malay>
(err) example [lah] during (err) exam during exam period <malay>kira kita orang</malay> stressed <malay>dari</malay> like <malay>buat</malay> maths mathematics <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari</malay> and all that stuff <malay>ni benda yang</malay> I <malay>rasa orang lain tak faham</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam dia orang kira</malay> [oh]
<malay>main</malay> sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but <malay>dia orang tak faham yang</malay> like for people like us people <malay>yang selalu buat</malay> sports and all that
it's like our safe place [ah] like it not only does it take our mind off work but it also builds our confidence in that aspect
cause <malay>macam</malay> you do math then you are like !wah!
!wah! <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh</malay> I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you are like okay I need to go and like do something else but let's say if you are if you are if you want to do something else but you are also not very good at that something
then you will like !wah! then you even more stress you you feel even more like <malay>lebih teruk</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> like
<malay>dari dari pendapat saya</malay>
I <malay>macam</malay>
I would like to be good at some like very very good at something because
I feel that it would help me
in my own self confidence
in that sense ya so number one was (err) stress management number two would be to be very good at
(err) running
then number three I feel would be
(um)
don't be so direct
like like I shouldn't be very direct because sometimes
I can okay there are times when I can read situation <malay>betul betul tapi</malay>
I just feel like
!aiya!
don't bother [lah] just say it just say it even though like the situation may not be right for it
but I just say what I think
and like most sometimes it can be bad [lah] like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
and
all humans got flaws right
so
the thing is
especially older people they don't like it when you point out their flaws
you know so <malay>kira</malay> you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
I'm not the kind that will like tell indirectly to somebody then that somebody tell the somebody I will just tell you straight and a lot of people don't like that
so I <malay>rasa</malay> like that's one thing that I can work on [lah] and that's something that I should work on
ya so those are like my three skills that I would like
ya ya
okay one more [oh] yes
<malay>apakah sesuatu yang</malay> you
you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak yang</malay> you wish that would be free
anything like anything in the world
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge <malay>dari segi wang tapi juga macam</malay> you don't have to work for it
you know
like it just comes <malay>macam gitu</malay>
you wish for it and it comes that kind
(mm) okay that's true
okay [lah] then we keep it to <malay>benda</malay> physical [lah] like <malay>macam yang benda</malay> monetary [ah] monetary
<malay>dari segi wang</malay>
anything
free <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>kita sendiri</malay>
(uh)
(hmm)
stocks
okay for me right
I feel like the one thing I would want free of charge
would probably be food
because in my opinion <malay>macam</malay>
and if you can have all the money in the world right
if I had all the money in the world I would feel like I don't need to work
and <malay>macam</malay> you will feel very purposeless
like <malay>macam sekarang</malay>
<malay>kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>tak kerja tak</malay> like training <malay>macam kita orang</malay>
<malay>dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> then like I have had
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang</malay> feel very purposeless <malay>tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis</malay> exam [kan] <malay>abeh dia orang</malay>
<malay>tak payah belajar</malay> and all that stuff
so sudden all of a sudden you have like all this free time and then they are like !wah! I don't know what to do with it
so in my opinion right
if I were to have one thing that was free it would probably be food
not money or like or like the ability to buy stocks because
like
ya if you had you had if you had all the food in the world
if you could get any single food in the world
you can one of course you can feed yourself you can feed your family but
in a larger like extent
you can
okay [lah] you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems <malay>macam</malay> world hunger and all that stuff you know
which is I feel would grant me a sense of purpose [lah]
in that sense
so it would really
it will help not only myself but it would help <malay>orang lain</malay>
ya
so
that's for me
then (err)
(mm) [oh] ya just now you mentioned something about superpower
remember when I ask you the skill
so let's get let's get to that question if you had if you could have any just one but any single superpower what would you have
what would you want it to be
I feel like
<malay>satu hari macam</malay> in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
you know
that's something that I feel so
I wouldn't I wouldn't put that as a superpower because I feel like machines can make that happen
but to me one superpower that I would have would probably be to
would probably be
the ability to
you know how batman is you you read comics
you know how batman is like known as the greatest detective
because of his ability to like
read situations read people and all that stuff
and like look for things and all that
that would be my that would be the one superpower that I want
that kind of like intellect that kind of ability
that kind of smarts that would be the one and that kind of ruthlessness also
then that will be like the kind of superpower that I would want I I can't really find a word for it [lah] but
ya
because with that you can you basically can control everything
ya you would be the one person who know you will know your your
your opponent's moves before they even do it
which is like quite cool [lah] in my opinion
ya ya
[oh] building on that
then what superpower what super since you watch comics what super
hero or supervillain would you want to be
just one
I read both [lah] so
can be any
I mean you know mine [lah] mine would probably be batman [lah]
ya just because he's <malay>dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang</malay>
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him <malay>macam</malay> different
<malay>macam</malay> he will not stop until
he achieves what he wants to achieve
and but he also has certain morals that he doesn't
<malay>dia tak dia tak bunuh orang dia tak buat benda yang macam</malay>
that he that <malay>dia dia</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> deems as
(um) not good [lah] so basically whatever he does is really <malay>untuk kebaikan orang lain</malay> that kind and he will like do anything for his family
ya
so like in my opinion if you are talking about still being able to stay human
it will probably be batman
because then you don't you you yes you have to face the expectations like
the the the common <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>baca</malay> comics [kan] the common like theme throughout <malay>semua yang semua</malay>
(err) comic comic batman
is that
<malay>dia</malay> very rarely <malay>dia</malay> make mistakes
because <malay>dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja dia betul-betul</malay> make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when <malay>dia pun</malay>
(err)
<malay>apa tu dia pun</malay> makes mistake [lah] because he's human [what] so
in my opinion it will be batman [lah]
ya ya (mm)
[oh] carrying on with that because you know how batman <malay>selalu macam</malay>
they are labelled as
<malay>kadang-kadang</malay> in like comic <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>baca</malay>
he can be very like aloof
he can very he can be very like distant when he wants to be or he can be very controlling when he wants to be
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you <malay>rasa</malay>
<malay>orang lain</malay>
put on you
can be good can be bad you you just say [lah] <malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah]
I mean [oh] so basically it is that concept of with great ya [lah] like you said [lah] with great power comes great responsibility in a sense [lah] I mean in this sense it'll be
a label <malay>tapi macam</malay>
the higher the the higher you go in a certain thing the more expectations people like people expect you to be a certain way people expect you to like look a certain way do a certain way and all that stuff [lah] that's essentially what you saying
okay I mean
that's true
that's very true all of us all of us
okay very true
okay personally I feel like
I mean the most common one for me is
school [lah] like they they
everybody just has this idea that
like
I'm
a very fit I guess same as you
except that it is a
it is an idea <malay>yang macam</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> okay so
I I run and in the school like I I'm considered to be like the the one of the better ones [lah]
that that label that [oh] he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like <malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] you know
and I feel like
that's
that's not very accurate
and
I don't know [lah] I I do like you I <malay>macam</malay> plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence <malay>kira</malay> then you
somehow also place expectations on yourself like okay
I have to sort of live up to the expectation
you know you get what I mean <malay>kira</malay>
ya [lah]
so it's like outside pressure but also you on the inside telling yourself
okay I need to make sure like I I look a certain way I do a certain way I
train properly and all that stuff
but
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are <malay>kira</malay> unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like [eh] how come you today like a bit slow [eh] how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
or like how come your muscles not as defined that kind then you are like [ah]
okay I need to I need to go back and I need to work harder that kind
so in a way it can be bad
but if
you you you
if you don't
if you take it in a different light
<malay>kira</malay> it can be good [lah]
you feel
ya
that's for me personally
I don't know
I I
ya (mm)
(mm)
given your current life [kan] like <malay>kerja</malay> cause <malay>kita orang baru habis</malay> (err) exam
<malay>tapi</malay> like if let's say like five six years from now
what would your ideal day in life be
<malay>lepas lepas</malay> <malay>lepas</malay> uni <malay>bila dah</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> [ah]
what would your ideal day in life be
given that you get your dream occupation and all that stuff
I mean okay
to be fair I also <malay>macam</malay> I I feel the same way as you
the difference is like like in terms of
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say <malay>kalau</malay>
you want to help like people and all that stuff right
people you <malay>nak kasih dia orang apa yang</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak ada</malay>
then
like
I I <malay>pun nak macam gitu tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
training people
so like being a coach cause <malay>sekarang</malay> like I I already sort of do that [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
(err)
I go back to school then like I help some of my I <malay>tolong</malay> coach I
to like (err) <malay>ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu</malay> [lah]
then I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
it gives me the most joy
so it I don't really think of it as coaching or a job I just think of it as
something that I like to do
<malay>lagipun</malay>
like if you are talking about ideal day
it will probably be <malay>pagi</malay>
coaching
then
while I'm coaching I can also be training
you get so it's like
they especially <malay>kalau lari</malay> [kan] so like morning will probably be an easy run
then I can like go and run with like my my students and all that stuff [lah] we can run together we can talk we can bond and all that stuff
<malay>tengah hari</malay> probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably <malay>macam benda</malay> technical and all that stuff which I can also do [lah] in that sense which would be better because in a sense <malay>kalau</malay> you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
it feels like
to me I don't know about other people [lah] but to me
I'm I as a student would be more motivated
or I as like an athlete will be more motivated if I see like my coach is also doing it you know like [eh] setting by example if coach can do it I also can do it I should be able to do it that kind you know so I feel like
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that [lah] this is of course like you said assuming <malay>yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam</malay> (err) my life [lah] that kind
ya
I don't know I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> ideal life is very training centric
but ya
is is is
it's fun [lah]
okay I mean
okay okay the one part that you said that I felt was important is that you are doing it for like the enjoyment of it [lah] you are not doing it for the competitive aspect of it
ya that's that's
something that I feel
it's something that I would never do
I will always
like
like like the reason why I will want to continue training is to compete [lah] that kind
you know
like maybe because like genetics and stuff I've never really had any problem with keeping with staying healthy
but at the same time
I understand [lah] that some people don't have that part
ya so I get where you're coming from

start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character [lah]
<malay>bukan bukan apa zina cakap pasal</malay> terrorists <malay>ini semua</malay>
but why can't she the be so why can't she be clear
and this is why <malay>dia</malay> shouldn't come in yet
okay <malay>kejap</malay> so <malay>dia orang</malay> actually <malay>sudah kenal berapa lama</malay>
<malay>dua tahun</malay> they know of each other for two years okay
okay
so new [sia]
<malay>zina dekat dia orang dia orang duduk duduk dekat mana</malay>
[oh] <malay>habis yang budak ini dia duduk dekat yang</malay> the couch <malay>yang</malay> facing <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia duduk dia duduk dekat</malay> the mirror side [lah] <malay>yang</malay> facing the living room there right
[ah] (uh)
so <malay>dia memang</malay> (uh) friend of a friend is it
<malay>tak tak penting</malay> [ah]
ya and then <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
so <malay>dia dia kalau</malay> police <malay>dia kalau</malay> finish a certain number of years bond <malay>dia dapat yang</malay> bonus <malay>itu</malay> [kan]
he's and and so he's actually <malay>macam</malay> upfront and really just
clear about what he's getting
<malay>apa yang susah sangat yang izat tak habis-habis yang macam cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>habis kau nak tanya dia punya gaji semua kau nak</malay> interrogate [kan] <malay>tak payah tanya budak ini sendiri cakap</malay>
[eh] <malay>merepek</malay> [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so what happen you <malay>tanya</malay> first [ah]
<malay>dia tinggal mana</malay>
<malay>apasal kena dekat istighfar</malay> [eh]
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>pun ada</malay> <malay>yang akan datang apa</malay>
<malay>habis</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>nak cepatkan kahwin dia</malay> [ah]
ya
he still thinks it it was the right thing to do <malay>itu</malay> [ah]
okay
(mm) because we haven't even consented to this relationship in the first place
<malay>habis yang zina cakap tak nak tunang itu apa</malay>
cough up [lah] information
<malay>habis</malay>
(mm)

[ah]
supporting [lah] ya <malay>dayah yang kena</malay> support [lah]
[ah] <malay>habis apasal</malay> taxi driver
okay
<malay>tapi dayah</malay> but [oh] my lord <malay>macam</malay> like
#dayah# is at the stage of her life that she's driven and <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of aspiration
<malay>habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia</malay> educated <malay>ke atau dia kaya ke</malay> at the end he's just going to be having this (err) aura of like <malay>macam</malay> relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
<malay>nanti tahu tahu</malay>
<malay>tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>berbual pasal ini</malay> okay <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>dia yang nanti belakang hari</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband <malay>lagi</malay> worse <malay>kalau dia</malay> have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character <malay>ke apa</malay> if he has it okay that <malay>macam</malay> he might ask #dayah# to stop working and things like that [lah]
<malay>habis</malay> so you just say that [ah]
#dayah's# [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand <malay>pasal</malay>
this whole like family who <malay>yang macam</malay> [oh] <malay>tahu benda orang orang</malay> I don't know family <malay>ke sesiapa</malay> [ah] <malay>yang rasa</malay>
[oh] <malay>lebih baik</malay> (err) <malay>halalkan percepatkan</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> as if <malay>macam itu ikut sunah nabi</malay> okay they take that part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage but the other part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like <malay>macam</malay> your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody <malay>yang macam</malay> that <malay>macam</malay> is complementary to like your personality
<malay>mana boleh macam</malay> like that [ah] ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack (err) <malay>macam</malay> complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see <malay>macam</malay> that is the thing that <malay>orang</malay> just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part <malay>nak kahwin cepat macam</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>ikut sunah nabi percepatkan</malay> but part part <malay>lain macam</malay>
to get somebody that is competent with you <malay>ini semua tak tak ambil kira</malay> [ah]
so fed up [ah] this type of thing
<malay>habis zina cakap zina macam mana</malay>
(uh) anyway this boy the call you <malay>abang</malay> or what
he should be comfortable with it [lah] <malay>dia ada kakak apa</malay>
I don't think he even thinks like this [lah]
[oh] so that's when he call you <malay>abang</malay> [ah]
[oh]
foresight [a'ah]
so the conversation <malay>dengan zina</malay> (err) <malay>bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar</malay> it's more of like what what did you say to <malay>zina pasal yang</malay> the growing up and then <malay>pasal pasal</malay> making a <malay>apa</malay> plan <malay>habis pasal apa lagi</malay> like what else did you address
did you say that did you say
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this [ah] <malay>kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena</malay> wake up music just just just use this card
<malay>kata nak kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu</malay> <malay>tengok sampai perempuan agaknya</malay> she will just be fed up one day <malay>tapi betul apa macam</malay>
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect <malay>macam</malay> do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
easy go easy (uh) <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> (uh) [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>itu tak ada pendirian</malay> [lah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
no <malay>macam gini</malay> the thing <malay>yang dia nak kena</malay> differentiate is <malay>ada bezanya</malay> easy-going <malay>dan tak ada haluan</malay> this is the thing #zina# you are which one
easy-going <malay>atau</malay> actually you are directionless
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
you said that [ah] <malay>untuk si ashraf ini</malay> [ah] <malay>habis ashraf cakap apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>budak ini pun tahu ke tak</malay> the background of #zina#
are you sure or not #salim# I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
so this easily two years <malay>baru</malay> meet up <malay>tahu</malay>
!haiya!
I mean I !haiya! I don't know what to feel about this
I mean yes <malay>macam</malay> I am thankful and it's nice to know <malay>budak ini budak baik</malay> (err) so like what #izat# say <malay>kau tengok</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia</malay>
ya [lah] ya <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want after this #izat# say !huh! <malay>kau tengok macam aku cakap</malay>
<malay>dia budak baik</malay> I hope #izat# doesn't go like this [lah] ya but anyway
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
ya
send ya
must take this action
<malay>sambil lewa</malay> anyway what I was saying okay
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether (uh) I
I really don't know [lah] this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes <malay>macam</malay> to
push <malay>zina tapi</malay> I don't know if at the end of this product is #zina# will be
pushed or #zina# will be pulled down
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all #zina# loses <malay>dia punya</malay> identity because this she is she is <malay>macam</malay> dissolving into a very
(err) big personality how to say not big [lah] firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
[ah] it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible <malay>lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia</malay> see that I don't know [lah] sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if <malay>macam</malay> she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that <malay>macam</malay> you know like [ah] a woman shall be like <malay>macam</malay> be led by a man that kind of thing and
your life will turn out well
[ah]
at because at some point there will be a point that <malay>macam</malay> she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
no it's not say <malay>tak lepas tangan</malay> it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse <malay>faham</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself [tau] this twentieth (uh) twenty some age
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to #dayah#
<malay>tak pernah tanya dia zina tak pernah tanya</malay>
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with #izat#
!huh! you talk about marriage to #izat# like what
this was before [lah]
seriously
but #dayah# said <malay>yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang</malay> denmark <malay>itu</malay>
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff <malay>orang punya</malay> personal is to us superficial
ya but #zina# can also ask you the same then why and why you and #izat# is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and #izat# are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya [lah]
ya [lah] because also also #dayah# always clamps her down
then you <malay>tak cakap macam dengan zina</malay>
at the end of the day #zina# #dayah# is still your sister <malay>macam</malay> you know she still cares for you [lah] then you know like
maybe she you <malay>tak cakap</malay> [lah] why why didn't you say to <malay>zina tadi</malay> like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you <malay>tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu</malay>
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya [lah]
ya ya
#hidayah# is clamping her down [lah]
ya ya
then <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini</malay> mama and <malay>abah</malay> was there <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> you cannot chat <malay>ini</malay>
!huh!
my why is my recoding still (err) okay you continue <malay>kejap kejap</malay> ya my recording is kind of
[ah] [ah] [ah] where
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>habis</malay> nevermind <malay>lepas itu</malay> then she say what <malay>dia tak cakap apa-apa</malay>
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to #izat# ever since <malay>macam</malay> she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
you said that okay
okay
<malay>habis dia cakap habis dia cakap apa</malay>
and just because #izat# is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue [lah] <malay>cuba kalau</malay> the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies <malay>kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat</malay> will be supportive <malay>pasal apa</malay>
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that <malay>macam</malay> don't say that
you are <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] it's not that she will see all this point
<malay>habis</malay> if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
you said that [ah] then
<malay>habis cakap</malay> you're close to <malay>izat pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>suruh izat tolong</malay> [ah]
<malay>budak ni segan silu</malay> !wow!
ya
but that's because <malay>dia orang</malay> don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to <malay>tolong</malay> them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it [lah]
but it's hard [lah] I mean it's also vary in age age difference <malay>macam</malay> I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
it's very hard and you will often require a certain (mm)
change of life events or certain
[oh] you also cannot engineer it [what] #salim# like <malay>macam</malay> you cannot be bringing the two of them together
<malay>habis</malay> expect <malay>dia orang macam</malay> (uh) to <malay>boleh berbual</malay> like at a very deep level <malay>mana boleh</malay> like it will also feel it's so <malay>janggal macam</malay> it was so it was just feel so weird [lah]

okay <malay>kira sambung balik</malay> [ah] <malay>tadi soalan apa kau buat sampai malam</malay> [ah] <malay>semalam</malay>

ya
(hmm)
<malay>macam mana nak</malay> (hmm)
nothing
I mumbling I mumbling
<malay>tak ada</malay>

[eh] bro long time no see [ah]
not that [ah] actually cause I just got sacked [ah] by my company
ya ya you saw my posting is it
ya that was back then [lah] but <malay>sekarang dah kena buang</malay> [kan] so <malay>tak ada guna</malay> [ah] <malay>nak tengok tu semua balik</malay>
(err) around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful [lah] cause
I got to travel to different countries [ah]
among all the countries I would say
(uh) saudi arabia cause (uh) it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
so <malay>aku rasa lebih aman</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay>
[ah] saudi arabia [ah] #mecca# <malay>rasanya kat</malay> #mecca# <malay>sana semua</malay>
no <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku tak pasti</malay> [ah] <malay>apa pasal</malay> corruption <malay>ni semua tapi</malay> I did read over the news that (uh) ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself [ah] but then
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion [lah]
(err)
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
(uh) finding [oh] discovering new food there the arabic food was
amazing I would say <malay>sebab dorangnya</malay> taste
a bit different from asian <malay>nya</malay> culture <malay>dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit</malay> [lah] and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I would say I would want to go to
spain [ah] cause ya I would like to go to spain cause
(err) I want to go to #barcelona# cause
I will to get a chance to meet #messi# [ah] you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>disebabkan</malay> COVID period [kan] <malay>aku rasa</malay> no chance [lah] <malay>nak gi sana nak jumpa atau</malay> maybe <malay>kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada</malay> chance <malay>kot</malay>
<malay>maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau</malay> in singapore
so far <malay>aku rasa dorang dah main dah</malay> start <malay>main cuma</malay> it's just that no [ah] spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will [ah] suffer a lot of loss [ah] cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue [lah]
actually <malay>tu yang aku pelik</malay> [ah] but then (uh) I did make a research [ah] on the internet and I found out that (uh) they make money through (uh) fans memberships the merchandises like example (err) <malay>satu apa ni baju bola</malay> [kan] they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe [what] so <malay>kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin</malay> they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover [lah] you know before the
whole (uh) football period (uh) resumes
(uh)
ya <malay>aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat</malay> facebook <malay>apa semua</malay> especially in singapore (err) aviation <malay>macam-macam kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya</malay> (err) <malay>kita tengok</malay> singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial [ah] aids to (um) singaporeans [ah]
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang aku</malay> rest [jer] <malay>kat rumah sebab</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> to stay close [ah] with my family
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective [lah] but I would say it's hard [lah] [ah] you know to find a job that [ah] that is suitable with me <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit</malay> savings <malay>aku</malay> [ah] <malay>alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat</malay> save for the past (err)
months that I've been working as air steward <malay>kalau tak mungkin aku kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>cari mana-mana kerja</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>risau juga cuma</malay>
<malay>alhamdulillah</malay> again <malay>aku dapat</malay> save quite a lot
I mean <malay>aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau</malay> [kan] but then ya I would (err) the savings that I save
probably can last me for six months [ah] if I really (err) spend accordingly and safely [lah] and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
[oh] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku baca hari tu kat</malay> facebook <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa kerja</malay> as a swabber is it they could earn like
four thousand !wah! that I think that's a lot [eh] for a part-time job
maybe cause (err) they are finding people who are willing to work (uh) a risk a risky job [lah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> they are willing to pay that much
<malay>tapi</malay> to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer [lah] <malay>sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi</malay> maybe it's better if government pay them [lah] you know
[oh] I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
(uh) moving forward
it will be a tough period [lah] for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera [lah] you know <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>nak cakap susah memang</malay> [lah] <malay>susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun</malay> wonder on how singapore would cope with this (um) COVID nineteen [lah]
(mm)
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs [lah] you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that [lah] cause as we (um) you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
(err) the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
and <malay>tu pasal aku rasa penting</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>ada</malay> plan [lah] <malay>untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada</malay> family <malay>atau beli rumah aku rasa</malay>
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important [ah] in singapore
(uh) ya I get that a lot [lah] I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
(err) it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
(err) you know a lot of children I don't know [lah] maybe for them it's a <malay>rezeki</malay> but in terms of singapore context
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you [lah] but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided (err) you are not doing overtime or what [lah]
so ya two thousand is not enough [lah] at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that (err) or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling [lah] you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and (um) the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them [eh] sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children [lah] you know maybe
for (err)
primary school children [kan] <malay>tak payah bayar</malay> school fees <malay>ke</malay> or maybe edusave <malay>bagi lebih banyak sikit ke</malay> you know
ya I really agree on that [lah] we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know (err)
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right !wah! my house [ah] I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you [lah] to [ah] hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time [eh] you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
(uh) this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news [lah] I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry [lah] to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree [ah] there are multiple aspects that (um) lead to (err) emotional (err) depression
or probably (um)
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right (um) financial
(uh) issues I think is the most depressing issue [lah]
you know cause
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this <malay>aku kadang-kadang pening</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab aku dapat gaji</malay> [jer] <malay>aku kena kasi</malay>
<malay>apa ni adik-adik aku</malay> [eh] sorry <malay>adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar</malay> bill <malay>aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi</malay> [ah] then <malay>aku kadang-kadang</malay> barely <malay>aku cuma ada kadang-kadang</malay> five hundred for myself like in every month
so <malay>walaupun</malay> I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with !wah! sorry with whatever I'm having [lah] you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period [lah] for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
I mean I sometimes I really wonder <malay>macam mana orang-orang yang</malay> (err) <malay>sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak</malay> [lah] you know <malay>rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar</malay> [tau] <malay>dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar</malay> bill
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think [ah] I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very (uh) depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also (err) came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID [lah] I mean some people
(err) actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why [lah] I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything [lah] that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
(um) hold the border
to some (uh) high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news [lah] maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
(uh) explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the (uh) about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
being raped which I'm totally (uh) angry about <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk</malay> singapore <malay>mungkin kalau aku</malay> ironman <malay>mungkin aku akan pergi sana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku nak</malay> save <malay>dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau</malay> (err) <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>sedara kau sendiri</malay>
(uh) was tortured was raped in front of other people
(uh)
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
they you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they
torture all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's (err) moral morally right [lah] I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
<malay>tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi</malay>
<malay>ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua</malay> I really
(err) don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say (uh) history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being (uh) killed
(err) you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
(err)
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
ya I really (err) I'm really disappointed that (um) the muslims are treated that way and also another case is <malay>sekarang ni</malay> happening in this world is
(err) I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really (err)
being outcasted in what you think about that
ya I mean in every community [ah] be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it (err) it (err) really (err) bring a hole
(uh) present representation of the whole community and as you can see in [eh] <malay>aku tengok</malay> (err) <malay>kenapa</malay> police <malay>dorang</malay> (err)
<malay>apa</malay> treat all those (uh) black people with such violence and brutality
where recently <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> news (err) <malay>satu orang dorang siapa nama dia</malay> george floyd was killed
intentionally in front of people !wah! that was another level of murder I would say [lah]
(err) <malay>aku tak tahu apa yang tak</malay>
police police <malay>tu fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa</malay> (err) <malay>orang tu dia setakat</malay> (err) <malay>apa ni ada</malay> fake <malay>duit</malay> [jer] which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
(err) we did have I mean we do have (uh) casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it [lah]
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such (uh) racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
<malay>aku rasa dalam negara ni</malay>
(err) <malay>orang masih boleh</malay> you know <malay>kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma</malay>
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others [ah] you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist [lah]
ya I heard that (um)
<malay>dekat sana ada</malay> this thing called <malay>bumiputera</malay> where the malays are given
the malays do have more privilege than (uh) comparing compared to other races [ah] know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a (uh) national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country [lah] you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example [ah]
you and your neighbour
wanted to buy this house at <malay>taman melawati</malay> [lah] you know in #kuala lumpur# or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
and do you think you are treated fairly as as a citizen
that's what I heard [lah] I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean (uh) but then ya that's what I heard [lah] when you are chinese indian
(uh) sarawakian or #sabah# you know someone from #sabah#
you have you don't have that <malay>bumiputera</malay> rights where you can
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in I mean in malaysia
actually
should be <malay>bersyukur</malay> you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually [kan] <malay>kalau dorang gi klinik</malay> they could actually
they (uh) <malay>dorang cuma perlu bayar</malay> one <malay>ringgit</malay> [jer] [tau] one <malay>ringgit</malay> for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
a clinic I don't know you could (err) easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say [ah] but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be (err) it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being [ah] you know
they are they are going to get charged in court [eh] I know you confirm know [ah] who's that guy [ah] #najib# (uh) #najib razak# and some other
his (uh) friends getting charged at court cause
they (err) they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and <malay>kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke</malay> I mean
okay [ah] <malay>berdosa tu dah</malay> another level <malay>dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> [eh] <malay>rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu</malay> and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
<malay>kapal apa</malay> yacht [eh] I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something !wah! that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister [lah] like that you know what you think about that
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years [ah] but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and <malay>mesti dia akan dapat</malay> lawyer <malay>yang bagus-bagus</malay> [ah] and he might win the case and just (uh) go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years [ah] so
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way (uh) you know they
they (uh) give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny [lah] but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
is a joke you know is a joke you know <malay>kau kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> (uh) how how well
[ah] our ministers in singapore is acting and how (uh) well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very (uh)
I would say [ah] I don't know what to say [ah] it's very good [lah] I would say what you think about that
actually actually <malay>memang ada tapi</malay> (err)
(uh) he he's called the <malay>yang berhormat</malay> speaker you know he's the man in the centre that (uh) will call on each (uh) each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
(uh) ministry like for example financial or et cetera [lah] and but then
I really (err) you know in <malay>melayu</malay> [ah] they say <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say [eh] speaker <malay>diam</malay> [lah] [eh] speaker <malay>apa ini</malay> you know they are very chaotic you know and
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke [lah] I mean have you watch the singapore [one]
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister #shanmugam# and mister what it's called [ah] mister #vivian balakrishnan# the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
bro (uh) I don't find it weird [ah] cause <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau]
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
all of the ministers actually <malay>ada</malay> fake degree you know he actually <malay>beli</malay>
<malay>di apa</malay> a fake degree on internet or something or <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia suruh orang</malay>
<malay>pergi ambil</malay> degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something [lah] I mean <malay>memalukan</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
I mean <malay>kau dah tak</malay>
<malay>kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus</malay> and
you being a minister you will only (err) how to say (uh) not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do [lah] you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with (uh) in a higher position right they seem (uh) they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it [lah] so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most [ah] I repeat again most ministers
are recruited (uh) based on merit [lah] you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya <malay>aku aku</malay> happy [ah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>ada</malay> government <malay>yang</malay> stable [ah] <malay>walaupun ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ramai kata apa</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay> minister <malay>ni tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>minister tu tak bagus tapi</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> <malay>kita nya</malay> government quite stable [lah] and <malay>aku</malay> happy to see that ya
[eh] actually <malay>aku terima soalan ni banyak gila</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak duduk</malay> malaysia the reason being is that
[ah] the peace and financial freedom <malay>mungkin sebab masa tu</malay> I mean still (uh) <malay>sampai sekarang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku masih kerja kat</malay> singapore [kan] and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted (uh) into the malaysian currency it's time <malay>apa</malay> times three <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>satu dolar tiga ringgit</malay> and you when you go there <malay>kau boleh</malay> spend <malay>apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa</malay> spa <malay>apa bagai</malay> and <malay>kau boleh buat apa-apa</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana</malay>
and <malay>kau kerja kat sana</malay> [eh] you might not be (uh) spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia <malay>ringgit</malay> example you are earning two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in malaysia
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
!huh! so you willing to wake up in the
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and <malay>kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik</malay> bus <malay>atau naik</malay> motor <malay>pergi kerja sini</malay> and okay [lah] <malay>mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam</malay> twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
<malay>sebab</malay> ya the you know the okay example <malay>kau bangun pukul empat pagi</malay> then <malay>kau kerja sampai lima pagi</malay> and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and <malay>kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam</malay>
and you know <malay>kau</malay> barely have time for yourself [ah] you know <malay>kau rasa kau akan</malay> do that for a long term or
(um)
(uh) maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
you know try to spend two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> I mean
of course [ah] it's not easy for them I mean <malay>aku pun ada sedara kat</malay> malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in [ah] you know <malay>dalam kampung-kampung semua</malay> and (um) <malay>kalau kat</malay> singapore <malay>apa orang kata</malay> is it or gross income [lah] <malay>dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit</malay>
<malay>atau seribu lima ratus ringgit</malay> and
it's still <malay>tak cukup</malay> you know cause they are living in a <malay>dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin barang-barang murah tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>barang-barang lain macam</malay> bill <malay>makanan apa semua</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam</malay> and still <malay>tak cukup untuk dorang</malay> so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles [ah] so we cannot justify on what they are facing [ah] but [kan] in singapore itself it's very hard you know
(err) like I said [lah] having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
(uh) ya I mean I do agree [lah] on what you are what you just speak you know but (uh)
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past (uh) thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
(err) no I I don't
I mean I might sound
(err) like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships [lah]
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is <malay>haram</malay>
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong [ah]
have have you even notice that you know this person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said [lah] I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore [lah] you know <malay>penting gila</malay> I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to <malay>tolong</malay> you to to (uh) you know to give <malay>duit</malay> I mean
it's embarrassing [ah] I mean this is not some gender inequality [lah] but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that (um) ya actually women [ah] do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
(uh) have to lead them [lah] I mean I mean this topic is very (err) subjective [lah] you know but I think in singapore women are really (um) having a good career earning more than man I would say
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains [ah] birth rate in singapore is declining [kan] <malay>orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab</malay>
ya <malay>dorang risau</malay> [kan] <malay>apa tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada tak cukup duit</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> time and
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada</malay> maid <malay>aku tak akan ambil</malay> maid <malay>untuk jaga anak aku sebab</malay>
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know <malay>besar</malay> I want to <malay>saya aku nak besar</malay> [kan] <malay>anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan</malay>
<malay>setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap</malay> they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them <malay>kasih sayang</malay> [lah] <malay>kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau</malay> you know <malay>dibesarkan dijaga oleh</malay> maid and maybe one day <malay>dorang tak kenal kau atau</malay> maybe <malay>dorang sayang</malay> maid <malay>lebih dari kau</malay>
(um)
<malay>gitu</malay> [lah] I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important [lah] singapore [kan] <malay>kalau kau</malay>
<malay>kau kau bayang</malay> [kan] <malay>kau</malay> spend
probably ten thousand twenty thousand for your own wedding [ah]
I mean actually
it's not even compulsory <malay>pun</malay> to have your own wedding
so <malay>yang penting</malay> I mean in our religion islam <malay>kita nikah dah cukup</malay>
<malay>tak penting pun</malay> then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend <malay>dekat kau punya rumah kau</malay> can pay <malay>lebih</malay> deposit
and stuff and (um)
ya [lah] <malay>aku rasa rumah</malay> and (uh) <malay>duit</malay> (um) savings <malay>untuk anak kau lagi penting</malay> [lah]
anyway [ah] it's a it's a good catch up with you I would see you again around
alright see you bye

okay hello hi [ah] #amir# how are you doing
!huh! okay [ah]
doing good (err) just I don't know
COVID situation
I don't know [ah] okay <malay>sekarang sekarang</malay> (err) I'm in army [kan] so
but the same for you [lah] you're also in army right so (err) it's just [ah] social distancing
okay
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] what are we doing now
okay understand
(mm)
ya
ya I think <malay>sekarang sudah tak boleh tak boleh pergi</malay>
like you cannot go places a lot of places [ah] <malay>banyak banyak banyak tempat tak boleh pergi</malay>
<malay>atau dia punya ada</malay> limit
<malay>ada</malay> limit to entry [ah]
(err) <malay>kalau</malay> [ah] tak tak tak sekarang masih masih</malay> five <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>sampai seratus</malay>
(mm) <malay>bukan</malay> [ah]
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
I don't know but I think <malay>tengok tengok apa</malay> like orang lain yang</malay> instagram stories <malay>nampak</malay>
<malay>ada ramai orang cakap tak ada</malay> in the same venue <malay>tapi</malay>
they take turns [ah] like in six
so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam pagi</malay> family then (err) <malay>petang</malay> just <malay>kawan-kawan dengan</malay> friends
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see [lah]
ya
(mm)
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>iya ke</malay>
(uh huh)
(uh huh) (uh) (mm) [ah]
(mm)
[ah] yours is [ah] that <malay>yang yang jemputan</malay>
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
[oh] actually [ah]
[ah] okay okay good
okay [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah] evening <malay>semalam</malay> only <malay>semalam</malay> I posted about it
(err)
I don't [ah] nothing much about it it's to me it's (err) quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause (err)
I post that like the last thing I said was (err) it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> it's a bit contradictory
[ah] paradoxical [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay>
(err)
like it it
because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself [ah]
really your score
really [ah] I see
[ah] I haven't seen that
[ah] same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school (err) to secondary school [lah]
as of time
ya ultimately (uh) what happens (err)
what secondary school the person goes to will affect their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about (err) that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
(uh huh)
(err) these days like
<malay>macam</malay> (err)
<malay>memang</malay> I don't keep myself up to date that much
like I don't read the news
ya
[ah]
[ah] (uh huh) <malay>memang memang betul betul</malay>
ya
basically that's the thing
(mm)
(err) okay
I <malay>sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang</malay> [kan]
okay <malay>kalau tengok</malay> in army in army
<malay>berbeza kalau</malay> compared to police <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>itu memang</malay>
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army [kan]
ultimately what is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
<malay>macam</malay> for example pack
<malay>lapan</malay> pack
or
fireworks
I guess
so
<malay>sekali dengan</malay> diagnose [ah]
[ah] <malay>pasal</malay> for us like
(err) we come from then
<malay>kita memang tak banyak apa berbual dengan apa orang lain</malay> [lah]
we just talk to our own people [lah]
[ah] own circle [lah] ya [oh] ya
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
ya these two years not wasted
<malay>satu tahun belum lepas kau nak</malay> two years okay okay <malay>tak apa</malay>
ya so far
ya [ah]
ya (err)
for some people <malay>kalau</malay> they didn't go to
<malay>dia orang memang</malay> won't have the opportunity to
(err) <malay>jumpa orang lain</malay> [ah]
so unless they went out of their way today
(uh huh)
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>betul betul</malay> actually it's actually true [ah]
(mm)
do anything else
ya true
[ah] ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in [lah]
but even in you can do stuff outside you can learn other skills in your free time [ah] if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
then (err) as I was saying [ah] in army is <malay>penat</malay> so
(err) so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
(err) which wouldn't be applicable [lah] cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn (err) can be applicable [lah]
(err) recently I went through this (uh) ammunition course
then (err)
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff [ah] (err) stuff related to storage
and (uh) inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
(err)
going out with my family that rarely happens
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang suka buat dengan</malay> family [ah]
<malay>kalau tak tak kalau dengan</malay> family for me [kan] it's just <malay>pergi makan</malay> [lah]
<malay>pergi makan sama-sama</malay>
<malay>pergi</malay>
<malay>pergi al amin bawah</malay> block
<malay>ataupun</malay>
[ah] homely vibes [ah] <malay>tak payah tak payah pergi tasik kalau nak pergi tasik pergi dengan kawan</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>betul betul</malay>

I see
[ah] easily [ah] [ah]
okay [mah]
[ah] okay <malay>betul</malay>
[ah] <malay>faham</malay>
so would you say on weekends do you usually spend more time <malay>dekat rumah atau keluar</malay>

[ah]

I spend
on weekends mostly at home [ah]
I spend my weekends are mostly at home usually
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> I can manage to arrange <malay>dengan kawan-kawan</malay> to go out
this usually happens like on a whim [lah]
so
ya sometimes I just stay at home relax but at home
you talk to your family [ah] at home
ya
ya that's good
[ah]
[a'ah] ya really
[ah]
ya
ya
(mm)
good point ya the thing with me is that I have
(err)
more women at home than men
so ya I only I only get to talk to my father about it but then
every time I go home he always
ask me questions about (err) when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one [ah] like that (err)
ya but during (err) during
he always ya that was the time when he compared the most because (err) <malay>pasal ada apa</malay>
(err) the start of the
for me for me there was the #tekong# experience [kan] the #tekong# experience <malay>dia orang</malay>
so my <malay>ayah dengan</malay> my <malay>kakak ikut pergi naik</malay> ferry <malay>naik</malay> ferry <malay>pergi</malay>

(mm)
that's cool that's cool wait
[ah] ya you didn't do twenty four (uh) twenty four [kan]
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the most recent batch they did (err) twenty four
in #tekong# ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
[ah] for for us [kan] <malay>bila kita</malay> pass by
(err) #changi# #changi# <malay>apa tu</malay>
usually #changi# <malay>ke</malay> east coast <malay>ada</malay> hawker center
hawker center [ah]
east coast [kan] east coast <malay>yang ada satay itu semua</malay>
ya
they were like [oh] thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits [lah] we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but (um) is to is to
yes
ya
[ah] that's a good point ya they just did
ya
[ah] nine weeks and then next one nine months [lah]
[ah] [eh] I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you [oh] you're going to talk about the pay [kan]
so (err) to me okay
<malay>jangan cakap</malay> pay [ah] you know it's more like a
allowance <malay>macam macam</malay> your parents give you during school
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
like for me for us it should be I think <malay>pasal</malay>
(err) back in [kan] my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but dude I don't understand why <malay>kenapa sekarang</malay>
<malay>sampai sembilan ratus pun</malay>
<malay>tak sampai dua minggu boleh habis</malay> I don't get it
but it's okay
[ah] okay
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>senang apa</malay>
[ah] same
[ah]
[ah] <malay>itu pun sekali</malay> [ah]
(mm) that's the thing <malay>pasal</malay>
(err) for a lot of people [kan] <malay>pasal masih muda</malay>
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending [lah]
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
for the most part they can like <malay>beli baju ke beli</malay>
<malay>makan makan</malay> more extravagant more extravagantly than you normally would [lah]
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
[oh] no me too
(mm)
(mm)
ya
same
yes yes [oh] my god
[oh]
election [ah]
ya
ya that's how it is but (uh) personally I also don't
(err) I don't follow that much
(err) I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates [ah] [oh] my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about but then finished already
so now they're talking about elections [kan] every day they will talk about stocks
!wah! buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive [eh] [ah] this one going up the percentages all
ya and (err)
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good [lah] I think it's good that
(err) more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's a good thing [ah] that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we (err) get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good [lah]
but the thing is that after this

because I need to eat I will go out and eat

<malay>itu pun orang tetap ingat</malay> okay and that's cool
ya the things you do I I haven't done anything like that in a long time like
I find myself not doing very kind these days I mean I do
like if I see opportunity like (err)
for example aunty needs to bring her bags outside the
ya like that I help but
(err) ya I don't see
like when it comes to friends I don't I don't I never see anymore
[ah] <malay>kekok betul</malay>

you doing the thing [ah] doing the thing
yes

ya that's the that's the that's the silver lining in helping others [lah]
that you have to consider their personal dignity
like when I do volunteering also I go to people's houses and I clean their house
there's certain things that they will say don't do this
don't don't wash my dishes that's not for you to do that's for me to do don't mop the floor I can do that
can you just paint the wall
or like reach for the top because I cannot do that
yes
ya so when you help others
like especially old people they only want you
to help when they really need it cause
they they still want to feel able
like putting it bluntly they still want to feel like they can do things on their on their own
ya
(mm)
ya
[ah] yes

<malay>kalau nak belajar</malay> ya okay maybe <malay>bila kat</malay> uni [kan] uni <malay>kalau tinggal</malay> hall <malay>ke</malay>

okay (uh) <malay>kau nak</malay> start
okay (uh) my name is
iman salihin also from singapore poly
year two also doing (uh) marine engineering
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
(err) okay first
<malay>aku</malay> join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed <malay>aku gi</malay>
(uh) higher NITEC but then I found out that (uh)
I got a chance to go [ah] because my
three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly (err) through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
<malay>ada ada minat</malay> [ah] so <malay>aku tak ada</malay> problem
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay>
like why why are you not (uh) interested
(mm)
(uh)
what else
okay (uh) so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay [lah]
ya
for me is (uh)
<malay>aku tengah</malay> doing #muay thai#
(uh)
actually from
from till now I just keep changing
<malay>dari silat</malay> then go squash
apparently now is #muay thai#
which I find (uh) more interesting than the others [ah] in terms of
(err) social connection and all that
<malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> is just
it's not my thing [ah] <malay>dikir barat</malay>
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because (uh)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> stage fright
then maybe because of that <malay>abeh dikir barat</malay> as I see is quite interesting [ah] like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
I guess now #muay thai# is going well so far
(uh) training quite intense so ya
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay>
that's the difference [ah] <malay>aku sebab</malay>
(err) that is <malay>macam</malay>
competition (uh)
not not a performance kind of competition [lah]
<malay>macam tu aku</malay> fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>sepak takraw</malay> [pe] so
that that competition <malay>macam orang tengok</malay> is normal
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
(mmhmm)
okay secondary school life okay actually because (err)
<malay>aku</malay> since young (uh) <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
not really sociable [lah] <malay>aku</malay> is a introvert ya
so
since primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> introvert so
but primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> still had this <malay>macam</malay> close friends so <malay>aku</malay> still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
still join <malay>takraw</malay> which is good and made a lot of friends there
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it [ah] and I go through it ya you go
(mm)
[ah]
so
is naughty [eh]
(uh)
okay that's the tough part <malay>sebab aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> didn't really got problem thus <malay>aku</malay> student counsellor so so <malay>aku tak boleh macam</malay> mess up [lah] so basically but the student council part also <malay>aku</malay> it wasn't
my choice [ah] because (err) sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
and then (err) <malay>dorang kira</malay> [kan]
<malay>sebab aku</malay> really from a
secondary school that is known to be
(uh) for like naughty kids [ah] and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
<malay>aku</malay> considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor [lah] in sec two ya
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>tak nak sebab aku</malay> just just <malay>malas</malay> [ah] then so (uh) the funny thing is
<malay>aku</malay> didn't even go for the interview even though I had to [lah]
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the (uh) the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
<malay>dorang dorang naik dekat</malay> (uh) assembly hall <malay>panggil aku dorang tanya</malay> (err)
why you never go for the interview and all that
okay <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say [oh] you got duty today then I'm like what
he's like [oh] ya ya you're a student counsellor [what] ya ya so I
wasn't expected [ah] but then I was just like
okay [lah] never mind I just I just take the role [lah] do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like (err)
naughty stuff that I did at least
[ah]
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya <malay>nanti ada orang hantar aku</malay>
go to sick bay <malay>nanti aku cakap</malay> stomachache and all that
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
guilty <malay>tak sangat</malay> right ya then
other then that (uh) not much [ah]
but to be honest <malay>aku rasa dorang tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dorang</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
<malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] can just go just go
ya like I think right after N level [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> first job <malay>aku</malay> was (uh) burger king which <malay>aku</malay> finds
still retail the the best (uh) job that I did [lah] as experience because okay I started
(err) in twenty seventeen which is (err) N level twenty seventeen after N levels (uh)
I join (uh) because a lot of my classmates work there also
so <malay>aku</malay> just join and then they quickly like train me
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun [lah] for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent [ah] because usually
(err) we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
(mm)
[oh]
a lot
(mm)
(mm)
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also [ah] and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
(mm)
so
after staff day <malay>takde lagi</malay>
(err) actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then (err) so compared to retail
(err) in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then (uh) imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like (err) how how can I help you then they like [oh] no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes [ah] then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king [lah]
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did (err)
photo booth (err)
kind of job
kind of [lah] because <malay>dorang macam</malay> (err) <malay>kira</malay> [kan]
(uh) business <malay>kecil</malay> so (uh)
<malay>macam</malay> referral [kan] so <malay>aku kerja</malay>
and then
the pay was quite good [ah] like three hours
I think <malay>aku dapat</malay> thirty forty
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
<malay>kau kerja</malay> is a different environment
so <malay>kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam</malay> some [ah] [a'ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> just at some park or some event
which was fun [ah] I got experience a lot
(uh) ya
that's all for the job experience [ah]
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute [eh]
it was terrible but (uh)
<malay>jadi</malay>
[eh] <malay>apa dah kerja</malay>
<malay>sekolah</malay>
(err) I think part of
the job experience also is why we
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about <malay>sebab aku lagi</malay> prefer hands on
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) business and all that
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
yup
so next year <malay>kita dua gi</malay> internship
ya
yup
shore
you quite excited [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> shore
(mm)
(uh) <malay>aku</malay>
so <malay>aku gi belayar</malay> second sem
which is exciting [ah] <malay>untuk aku sebab aku pun</malay> join <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> sailing the part
so six months sailing
exciting <malay>tapi</malay>
scary <malay>juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam</malay>
just one month of it how how can I cope [lah]
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of (uh) career
for me
<malay>sebab aku pun</malay> planning (uh)
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore (err)
<malay>aku</malay> start family and all that so ya
exciting [ah]
<malay>aku rasa kau</malay>
even though internship <malay>kau dapat</malay> shore [kan]
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> there's still a chance <malay>untuk kau</malay> sail in the future you know <malay>macam kalau kau</malay> still carry on with this career then <malay>aku rasa</malay> why not <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> diploma <malay>kau ada</malay> experience
so think is okay [lah]
<malay>takyah</malay> disappointed <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stuck at shore
yes <malay>sebab untuk aku</malay> (err)
<malay>aku</malay> rather sacrifice
<malay>aku punya</malay> time <malay>untuk</malay> (uh)
to have a stable living [ah] for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family [lah]
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine <malay>macam</malay>
nine to five job [kan]
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
[ah] exactly <malay>jadi untuk aku macam</malay> it's worth it [lah] <malay>kau</malay> go for six months
then got free for like like three months <malay>gitu</malay> three or more then
to be really you with your family [ah] and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
(mmhmm)
yup
<malay>macam</malay> by the time <malay>aku</malay> reach <malay>macam tiga puluh empat puluh</malay> is
you can pull down [ah] ya you can come back to shore maybe (err) continue as lecturer I you relax [ah] ya
even workshop <malay>takpe</malay> [sia] fun so
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah]
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh)
honestly following the trend [kan] <malay>aku rasa aku</malay>
we'll probably be posted to firefighting <malay>tapi</malay> personally <malay>aku nak</malay> army
ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku ada</malay> interest in the armed forces <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> the army navy <malay>ataupun</malay> air force [ah]
so (uh)
<malay>tapi</malay> firefighting <malay>pun untuk aku</malay> okay
<malay>tapi aku</malay> really <malay>tak nak</malay>
police
<malay>sebab macam bukan bukan wayang</malay>
(um) <malay>macam dari dari kecil</malay>
<malay>aku main bola bawah blok ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>atau aku gi</malay> skate <malay>ke apa nanti dorang datang</malay> screen <malay>abeh</malay>
(uh) it was a
ya and then since young <malay>aku</malay> had that (uh)
image of them <malay>macam dorang</malay> just
<malay>datang sini</malay> screen screen <malay>macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah</malay>
(err) <malay>aku pergi</malay> seven eleven <malay>beli</malay> maggi <malay>apa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang</malay> screen check check EZ-link <malay>semua aku</malay> don't find it
<malay>macam</malay> practical [lah] <malay>macam kau</malay> just <malay>kacau aku</malay> [kan] at this point [ah] so I never really had the interest for police
ya
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag <malay>aku</malay>
and it was like
[oh] what what yes
maybe <malay>dorang</malay> check <malay>rokok ke apa abeh aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just found it like like weird [lah] to be honest like until now also I still feel
(uh)
that sense of (err)
I I take it personally [ah] sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at <malay>nanti dorang tengok aku</malay>
[ah] [ah]
<malay>dorang tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang dorang panggil</malay> and <malay>dorang</malay> check bag <malay>aku macam</malay> just
why [ah]
but ya that's why <malay>aku tak nak</malay> police
then <malay>kau</malay>
ya
frogmen
(mm)
<malay>sama</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> air force
<malay>dorang pun ada lain punya</malay>
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam ada</malay> engineering <malay>punya</malay> part <malay>ada</malay> communications <malay>punya</malay> part
I because to be pilot also <malay>susah</malay>
so
<malay>kalau dorang</malay> offer <malay>kau untuk macam</malay> (uh) continue
posted to air force [eh] <malay>kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam</malay>
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I think <malay>boleh</malay> [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> the thing is I went for the
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
(mm) so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test [ah]
[ah] <malay>ada dorang macam</malay> test <malay>kau punya</malay>
mathematics [lor] they call it arithmetics
so <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
(err) at that point of time
(err) <malay>aku betul-betul nak</malay> so
months before that [kan] <malay>aku aku</malay> practice with this movie so <malay>aku aku tengok</malay> youtube video
<malay>aku</malay> take online test
unfortunately <malay>aku tak dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak bilang</malay> score
pay is
but that's the air force [ah] I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
(uh)
<malay>sebab dia ada aku rasa</malay> eight to ten different tests
so
(uh) <malay>ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah</malay>
but
honestly overall <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> did not bad
ya so <malay>tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
then hopefully just continue marine engineering [lah]
okay obviously <malay>kalau ada</malay>
the different opportunities
<malay>aku aku</malay> definitely would
ya consider
honestly <malay>kalau</malay>
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup (uh) I I don't mind any (uh) what you call that like areas [ah]
the job areas like engineering <malay>atau</malay> (uh) communications
<malay>kalau</malay> pilot [lah] who don't mind
(mm)
ya
ya
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> cockpit <malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> [ah]
so
ya
<malay>aku tengok macam</malay> national days <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti ada dia punya</malay> jet like cool [lah] <malay>untuk aku</malay>
but ya
what else
(mm)
what about copy [ah]
primary school life
spent there six years [eh] primary school
<malay>sama sama sama</malay> six years
which are compared to our different stages [lah]
so <malay>macam aku untuk aku</malay> primary school is when you develop your own (uh) character
ya
ya
<malay>sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku</malay> primary <malay>macam</malay> the most important
ya
(mm) yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending [ah]
[ah] the jump style
but ya primary school <malay>aku</malay> is (uh)
I think to through <malay>sepak takraw</malay> also
<malay>aku</malay>
(err) develop <malay>aku punya</malay> own personality
it's about (err) other than that
is <malay>aku</malay>
I'm a quite <malay>macam</malay> quiet person
<malay>jadi aku dalam</malay> class <malay>pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi bila aku</malay> join <malay>takraw baru aku macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>jumpa orang-orang ni semua</malay> and
I was quite good at it [ah] <malay>sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw</malay>
and then the coach was the one that <malay>macam kira</malay> recruit <malay>aku</malay>
through my brothers [ah] <malay>dia dia nampak aku dia cakap</malay> [eh] join [ah] join [ah] <malay>takraw</malay>
then then (uh) <malay>aku</malay> join and then
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
and then (err) it was funny [ah] <malay>sebab aku</malay> was
I was quite small in terms of size
(err) whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said [oh] you you sub the big one with the small one [ah]
but I I didn't mind [lah] because I know my potential and then from there (uh)
coach <malay>aku pun macam</malay> confident <malay>aku boleh main</malay>
so
by primary
I think by primary four <malay>aku</malay> managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four <malay>aku</malay> the captain at junior team and then primary five <malay>aku</malay> captain of senior team
ya so
ya ya that's why <malay>dari situ aku macam belajar macam</malay> this leadership roles
<malay>macam macam mana nak</malay> (uh)
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
<malay>sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sekolah</malay>
<malay>kalau aku tak buat</malay> homework <malay>pun dorang macam marah</malay>
so so ya
primary school was fun [lah] cause of <malay>takraw</malay> I mean
ya
#tekong#
(uh) depends
<malay>sebab kalau kalau</malay> (err)
okay usually striker is on your on the #tekong's# right
and then feeder is on the #tekong's# left
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> depending on #tekong# <malay>kalau dia</malay> left hand <malay>ke</malay> ya
(uh) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
usually striker and jumper for right leg
and then if the #tekong# is left legged then feeder <malay>nak kena belajar campak</malay>
ya
!wah! I think after almost ten years playing
(uh)
I mostly play either #tekong#
<malay>atau</malay> striker
<malay>tapi aku lagi suka</malay> striker
<malay>yang boleh bebas selang</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>takraw</malay> was fun [lah] <malay>tu tu pun macam mana aku macam</malay>
<malay>belajar</malay> [ah] the
the thrill of competition
<malay>macam lawan</malay>
<malay>sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk</malay> nationals
and then (uh)
gain my own confidence [lah]
primary [eh]
queenstown primary <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> queenstown secondary ya
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
<malay>asal dorang bagus</malay>
[oh] <malay>sebab aku rasa</malay>
okay <malay>aku</malay> remember primary five
(err) that was like the our best performance
for the senior team [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
against (err) since the first round <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> beat every school
(uh)
the west zone okay so <malay>kita</malay> east zone (err)
(uh) school <malay>ada</malay> east north (uh) west <malay>dengan</malay> south
<malay>jadi kita dari</malay> east zone
<malay>jadi kita</malay> meet all these different schools <malay>yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita</malay> beat them [ah]
(err) using basics <malay>kita tak ada macam</malay> fancy fancy <malay>semua tapi</malay> coach <malay>kita ajar macam betul-betul</malay> master your basics
(uh) and I also think that's important [lah] because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
<malay>kita</malay> beat all these schools from
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until (uh) finals
<malay>tak itu yang</malay>
(uh)
[oh]
east zone is #junyuan# primary
ya <malay>tapi aku</malay>
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
(uh) is #qihua# #qihua# primary
and
either #qihua# or #junyuan# [ah]
but
ya #junyuan# is the east zone
champions [ah] power house
but
surprisingly national that time primary five <malay>kita</malay> beat <malay>dorang juga</malay> #junyuan# ya so <malay>kita macam kita ada</malay> this momentum [ah] which starting <malay>sampai</malay> finals <malay>kita tak kalah</malay>
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like (err) even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like (uh)
personally I felt was possible [lah] but it it came down to my
my (uh) my team
that day first
first team
(uh) <malay>menang</malay> #qihua#
second team <malay>kalah</malay>
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> champions
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
so <malay>macam</malay> every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus <malay>ada nama ni semua</malay> but never #tampines# north primary school
that was so it was
I I lost [ah] it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
(uh) if
if (err) one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
(err) we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
[a'ah] [sia] <malay>aku nangis rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really felt the responsibility [ah]
[eh] but ya
ya
<malay>sebab kita punya</malay> vice principal <malay>kat situ</malay>
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us [lah]
but the #tampines# north <malay>tak pernah</malay> achieve this kind of achievement
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
(uh)
it was a big accomplishment [lah]
but ya
okay
performance
wait delta league <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[oh] okay
okay
ya ya ya
think <malay>macam</malay>
is is a very big accomplishment [lah]
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay>
congratulate [lor]
<malay>abeh aku nampak</malay> that time <malay>kau</malay> post <malay>kat</malay> instagram <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang</malay> still <malay>cakap apa</malay> boys become last at least
which is demotivating [ah]
yup
yup
I think
<malay>dorang</malay> shouldn't <malay>macam</malay> just celebrate because you get at least fourth <malay>macam dorang</malay> should celebrate the change you know
[ah] that's why
no
!wah! <malay>takde</malay> love life [lah] okay <malay>tinggal macam</malay> four minutes
so
no
okay [lah] (uh) so
<malay>aku</malay> attached
ya together with someone
(uh)
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
<malay>aku jumpa dia</malay> through
(uh)
this overseas trip
<malay>dia pergi</malay> cambodia
(uh) it was a service learning trip [lah]
so
<malay>dia</malay>
okay so total sec two that time <malay>ada macam</malay>
seven class
so
she's from (err) two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
(uh)
so we went to this overseas trip then
(uh) I tried to make friends [ah] then (uh)
one of them was her
(mm)
back then I was just like making friends with her
then
I think after the trip
then I was just like thinking about I was just like
she's a nice person and all that [lah]
and then (uh)
we were we were quite close after that trip
and then (uh)
during sec three
(uh) we
we were in the same class
okay then
from there started to talk more often and all that
ya <malay>boleh</malay> click [ah] so
but that time sec three (uh) <malay>dia suka orang lain</malay>
[ah] <malay>tapi aku</malay> don't mind <malay>sebab</malay>
it was just to me like a
<malay>macam</malay>
just find her pretty you know <malay>macam</malay> I can
ya ya
so
[oh] ya <malay>aku</malay> okay then
(uh)
late sec three
<malay>yang macam dia punya</malay>
relationship <malay>dia tak</malay> work out
<malay>sebab macam</malay>
that that guy just wanted to play games
like as in like like like literally play game
ya so he's a gamer [ah]
ya so when he play game he also never tell her anything so she left on read
so ya but then [ah]
I think during N levels (uh) we studied together and all that
after N levels we somehow got together [lah]
for what
to ask
(uh)
obviously I ask [ah]
ya ya but
but ya she's
she's chinese
(uh)
she's christian
ya
and then
so
she's the opposite of me [ah] basically in terms of race and religion
because I'm malay (uh) I'm muslim
but she's chinese and christian but
so far I I look past that [ah]
but I still see a future [lah] is just
how things will work out
but ya
how about you
okay
but okay
(mmhmm)
ya

okay I think we're recording
(err) so my name is #Umar# and my conversation partner today is
so
so <malay>ini hari</malay> we will be talking about corona virus
(err) in Singapore and how so far <malay>kita kat sini</malay> at home and (uh) my family <malay>semua</malay> how we've been coping
(err) with all the jobs and all the (um) confinement <malay>semua kat rumah</malay>
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting <malay>dengan</malay> all my friends [lah] basically
so okay obviously okay I start [eh] so basically (um)
<malay>bila</malay> we heard about all this (um)
corona virus thing (err) <malay>dulu</malay> back then I was somewhat employed [lah]
then after that (um) when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in #Jakarta# (err) celebrating Chinese new year [lah]
<malay>terus</malay> (um) when I heard about it at first (err) it didn't seem like such a big deal [lah] because (um)
people over there were quite (err) <malay>rilek</malay> they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
(err) maybe it won't be as such a big issue [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> after that when I came back (um)
I was given a couple of mask <malay>tapi</malay> I thought like okay [lah] not really necessary but (err) eventually it turns out that
(um) the the the hype so called or the whole issue (err) it it went up and then
so that time <malay>bila</malay> we saw it on the news (err) my my girlfriend's (uh) auntie [lah] so <malay>dia kasi</malay>
(uh) because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only <malay>macam</malay> ten masks or so something like this
<malay>habis</malay> (um) ask us to use it (err) when we are at the airport <malay>sebab</malay> (err) who knows [kan] especially Indonesia <malay>agaknya</malay> maybe
not so safe [lah] and then (err) so I flew back I still wear the mask (uh) at first I thought <malay>macam</malay> too much [ah] actually <malay>macam</malay> maybe
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore (um) and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then (um) the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and (uh) at first I was going to work and slowly (um) you see more and more people
<malay>kat</malay> station <malay>pakai</malay> mask <malay>habis</malay> (um) some of them (err) they there was no form of social distancing [ah] back then so there was no such advice but
mask <malay>ada</malay> quite a number of people they were wearing it [lah] and then (um) they decided to
eventually (err) make an announcement on and said that <malay>dia punya</malay> mask <malay>ini semua</malay> actually not mandatory [lah] at first then <malay>cakap</malay> only <malay>kalau macam</malay> you sick (err) you stay at home
(err) just <malay>jaga</malay> yourself [lah] there's no need to go out (um) and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
(um) slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt <malay>banyak orang orang macam</malay> didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe (err) eventually (um) it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic [lah] <malay>habis</malay> Malaysia <malay>orang</malay> Malaysia affected <malay>orang</malay> Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to <malay>macam</malay> got on the list [lah]
[ah] so at first we were the first <malay>habis</malay>
(um) we were eventually taken over by (um) okay [eh] at first it was China [lah] and then second it was Singapore
at first [ah] this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries (uh) in Italy
(err) in Euro and then slowly got to America and now <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita</malay> in a state where (um)
is the highest [lah] so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
(err) but that's how I remembered my experience (um) when it first started (err) and how at that point of time I was
employed <malay>habis sekarang macam</malay> like looking for job because (uh)
let's put it like (um) I wasn't employed anymore (err) after this whole situation so now looking for job [lah]
how about your experience <malay>macam mana</malay> you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think <malay>siapa siapa</malay> anyone [lah] was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted <malay>banyak</malay> (um) even home based business at some point was (err) affected [kan]
(uh) that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less <malay>macam</malay> slammed her
some authority figure [ah]
ya but (err) because of what she said a lot of people <malay>macam tak</malay> satisfied [lah] <malay>diorang macam</malay>
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
(um) <malay>kena pulau rabak rabak</malay> [lah] basically because of her statement she even
ya and
I think
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or <malay>niat dia</malay> the <malay>niat</malay> is there [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good <malay>macam nak tolong</malay> all these regulation issue [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay [lah] I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
<malay>tapi</malay> because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is (um) what she should have done was
after she did it and of course <malay>nak</malay> return <malay>balik dia punya</malay> statement <malay>susah</malay> [kan] but at least <malay>macam</malay> just go out there and just apologize properly
and say that (uh) you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen (err)
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say (err) I understand
<malay>tapi</malay> she chose to <malay>macam</malay> go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that (err) gone viral for no reason
(um)
and (err) some of them are funny <malay>macam</malay> the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend #Hadi# because okay to be fair <malay>sebab</malay>
#Hadi# dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see #Hadi# [kan]
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
<malay>habis</malay> he will <malay>macam</malay> [ah] be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants <malay>cuma</malay> bike is slightly different [lah]
like the first time I saw it <malay>macam</malay> this could be #Hadi#
it could really have been #Hadi# the way they dress <malay>dia punya seluar dengan dia punya</malay> helmet <malay>dia punya</malay> visor
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny [ah] but I saw the article [lah] I think Mothership covered this article about him
(uh) unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but (uh) I think a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> does really
(um) <malay>macam</malay> it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite (uh) positive feedback [ah] about the guy <malay>dia</malay> super extra [ah]
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes [kan]
because if you think about it (um) just the fact that during this whole (uh) circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
and (um) while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say <malay>macam</malay> this guy this #mat# just <malay>naik</malay> motor <malay>habis</malay> just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that <malay>dia macam</malay> very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
(err) actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
(err) the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
(mm) (mm)
(mm) well I have this opinion about (uh) all these food delivery [ah] so to my understanding [ah]
(err) the first <malay>tak salah</malay> Deliveroo was to start all this <malay>tapi</malay> in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something [lah]
but what I really feel about food delivery is <malay>dia macam</malay> quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second [ah] about Grab drivers (err) not Grab drivers
but (err) food delivery [eh] so I feel that (um) it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all (um)
people who are do food delivery all this <malay>kalau</malay> they really <malay>macam</malay> really work hard macam #chiong# all the way [ah] <malay>macam</malay> maybe eight hours #chiong# all the way <malay>macam</malay> #Hadi# for example [kan]
(um) they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay> incentive or <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) hours or <malay>dia punya</malay> right timing [ah] because all these riders [kan] <malay>macam dorang</malay> [dah] experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right <malay>kedai mana</malay> (um)
prepare food quickly <malay>kedai mana</malay> prepare food very slow they know how to play the game [lah] basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and they are blue (err) blue collar workers [kan] so think about this for a second [eh] to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to (um) like basically if you apply [kan] most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize <malay>macam</malay> your delivery [ah]
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for (uh) the lower income group to catch up
to the upper income group because <malay>macam</malay> especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars (uh) or something [ah] per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay> beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it [kan] so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar (err) job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about (err) food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
no much prerequisite [lah] maybe if you <malay>macam nak</malay> deliver <malay>naik motor</malay> [kan] then
[ah] <malay>kena pakai lesen</malay> you have to prove your <malay>lesen</malay> [lah] but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview (err) <malay>macam</malay> documentary [lah] don't know on Grab and how (err) some of the handicap people
(um) they managed to get jobs in Grab <malay>macam dulu</malay> (um) when they before Grab [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say <malay>macam</malay> if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes <malay>tapi ada orang macam</malay> down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know <malay>macam</malay> is like a big <malay>macam beban</malay>
<malay>duduk kat rumah jadi beban</malay> [jer] <malay>puas hati macam</malay> you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this (uh) girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair [lah]
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day [lah] for example on her electric (err) wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver [lah] maybe <malay>satu hari</malay> deliver four or five items [lah] for example
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is [ah] okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is (um) you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet [lah]
so <malay>macam berdikari</malay> [lah] so instead of
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
the interface <malay>macam</malay> the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
(err) it it simplifies the task basically <malay>pergi sendiri</malay> pick up <malay>pergi sana</malay> drop off so it it it gives this
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to (err)
admin position or something <malay>macam kena</malay> interview <malay>tak tahu</malay> pass <malay>ke tak</malay> (err) your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless <malay>macam kalau</malay> too saturated or something [lah] there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
(um) the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how (uh) blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers <malay>punya</malay> salary
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway (um) with regards to that (uh) there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
(err) (err) employment
(err) I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate <malay>macam</malay>
you you don't get (err) you don't get denied (err) okay <malay>selalunya</malay> the idea is when you do the employment [kan] (err) you cannot be judged based on your I don't know (err) race or
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis [lah] in singapore so whether you are (uh) as mentioned before whether you are
(err) low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide [kan]
so <malay>macam</malay> for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver [kan]
so (err) <malay>nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah</malay> so when you're tired you get home
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab (err) you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your (err) (err) picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
so that so called keep them motivated [lah] whereas <malay>macam</malay> delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really (err) let's say you already have a bicycle [lah] let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
and you don't have that burden of [oh] <malay>hari ini kena buat sepuluh</malay> delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
so it it simplifies a little bit
[ah] yes okay definitely [lah] so basically <malay>macam</malay> you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars (err) what you get
is (um) basically is through the app <malay>punya</malay> interface [ah] so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours [lah]
it's it's already a net amount <malay>dorang</malay> already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off (err) because sometimes
for example (um) whatever the food is <malay>dorang</malay> [dah] minus the food amount so (err) this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
<malay>terus</malay> (err) whatever is shown in your phone <malay>macam</malay> you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example [ah] that's yours [lah] basically
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
you are okay let's say you are riding <malay>habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan</malay>
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> !ee! I still got to go on I need to hit (um) ten deliveries today or (uh) I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
it has that sort of it extended flexibility [ah] and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way [lah] it's just something I just thought about recently
and how it is a good way for people <malay>macam</malay> let's say they have spare time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say they work nine to five
<malay>habis malam macam</malay> they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then (err) just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
maybe (err) do a three hour trip (err) three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home [lah] so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
(uh) as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that (um) a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such (uh) active (um) kind of employment especially for the lower income (uh) people to help a bridge to the higher income people
(err) ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> [dah] starting so much on delivery
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
(err) it does
(um) so during the circuit breaker period of [pe] was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing (um) did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery (err) did you meet anyone or
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to <malay>buku letak kat tepi
[oh] okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
what sort of (err) security feature or identification <malay>yang dorang</malay> implement
[kan] <malay>risau</malay>
no [lah] if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say [eh] I'm doing this (err) exam (err) next week
(err) I pay you two hundred dollars [lah] just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay [pe]
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already <malay>macam</malay> <malay>kirim salam</malay> [ah]
seriously
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle [lah] but you think that you are <malay>macam</malay> everything [dah] okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project <malay>kerja</malay> just to survive on the salary from that job
(um) but I kudos to you [lah] <malay>memang</malay> is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
right well characters is something inevitable
or Facebook <malay>ada</malay> politics [pe] <malay>sekolah pun ada</malay> politics [pe] but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
in school <malay>walaupun</malay> you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever <malay>belajar</malay> but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that <malay>macam</malay> there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying <malay>macam nak</malay> enjoy <malay>susah</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> okay it it depends on people right so (um)
I think also it depends on school as well [ah] because when I was in uni (uh) (um) a lot of people who went to like me [kan] they (err)
two major popular universities that they went to is either or [eh] so <malay>macam sekolah</malay> so basically you study throughout the whole year
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
whereas for the one that I went to basically (err) <malay>buat</malay> project
(err) it it it becomes like what (uh) eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent <malay>kat belakang</malay> exam
so in a way you can balance [oh] out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have <malay>macam ada</malay> solid group you can work with
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but (err)
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours <malay>ada</malay> project [kan]
sometimes (err) if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
(err) for a couple of years you actually (um) understand and appreciate what (err) higher academia can bring compared
to your peers (err) in school at the moment [kan] even for myself [kan] if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and (um) if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or (uh) it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to <malay>macam</malay> all these <malay>budak budak</malay> they still have not have a taste of full life <malay>macam</malay> full working employment yet
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
(um) you know it's the uncertainty of (err) okay [lah]
you know if I don't do well then don't do well [lah] you know but (uh) once you are in a position where you are out
that's why I think a lot of my friends <malay>yang</malay> (um) went to you uni SIM basically (err) university
night university [lah] so <malay>dia orang</malay> juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life [ah] there's no more social life basically
(err) <malay>pagi pagi</malay> daytime you go to work and then (err) malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time <malay>nak buat</malay> (err) <malay>nak buat</malay> group assignment <malay>nak</malay> study <malay>untuk</malay> exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
is very exhausting and (um) some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful (err) well kudos them
ya there's a lot of compromise (err) and you have to be willing to <malay>macam</malay> at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social [lah] because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
no [lah] at first to be honest [ah] at first <malay>bila</malay> all this thing happen [kan] <malay>macam</malay> (um) it's interesting (err) because is something novel
<malay>macam</malay> is not common <malay>apa dulu</malay> to to (um) communicate through okay maybe for you [lah] but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family <malay>tapi</malay> when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
(err) at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime (uh) <malay>kerja</malay> (err) in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward <malay>macam</malay> I think it depends on people also [lah] because <malay>ada orang ada orang boleh</malay> focus when they're at home
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks [lah] toilet [lah]
or the bed sleep [lah] take a nap during lunch time <malay>tu semua</malay> for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas <malay>kalau macam kat tempat kerja</malay> you've got to drag your ass and then
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people (um)
they switch into mode you know <malay>macam</malay> home mode (err) <malay>duduk kat rumah macam</malay>
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing <malay>punya</malay> mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is <malay>macam</malay> all wax style and then
[ah] you know you're wearing clothes (um) and then you go out and [eh] you you just have that vibe <malay>macam</malay> I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know <malay>macam</malay> when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
(err) I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
(um) if doubly is even a word for studying
so !aiya! I mean so
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in (um) I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in <malay>dia punya</malay> scheduling and stuff like that <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know [eh] ultimately it is a state of mind [lah] so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
<malay>macam dekat rumah</malay> you can just eat <malay>macam</malay> you can snack and all that shit (err) but <malay>kalau kat luar</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> you need to walk for it and (uh) I don't know
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you (err) do delivery (uh) I think the so called delivery fee is about <malay>macam</malay> four dollars something like this [kan]
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type (err) Foodpanda pro
and you can actually see they have <malay>macam</malay> those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package <malay>tak salah</malay> is (err)
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
no it's like a pass [lah] it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's <malay>apa macam</malay> limited edition [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> it's actually has been around for awhile
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but (err) if you go now it's definitely available
[oh] well people still deliver food a lot of people still <malay>macam</malay> still work from home [pe] <malay>banyak orang</malay> work from home [pe] <malay>sekarang</malay> [lah]
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well #Nurul# didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker [lah] so it's a different story but for those people who
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while <malay>sampai sekarang</malay>
suspect until the end of the year [ah]
fishy [ah] the Russian <malay>punya</malay> vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three [what]
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went #Jakarta# once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February [what]
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in (err) late January it was Chinese new year I had to go #Jakarta# but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or
no not May (err) April or something [ah] it didn't happen anyway so [ah] whatever [lah]
well <malay>kalau</malay> at the end of this year <malay>dapat pergi dapat pergi</malay> Malaysia <malay>pun</malay> I'm quite happy already to be honest
just need a break cause okay if you think about it [kan] people other than Singapore
all the other countries at least <malay>dapat pergi</malay> somewhere within their own country [kan] so Malaysia even Malaysia or Indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least <malay>boleh pergi</malay> #Penang# <malay>dapat pergi</malay> (um) I don't know
for one of the islands #Perhentian# islands or something you know #Sentosa# <malay>nak pergi</malay> #Sentosa# #Sentosa# <malay>ada apa kau</malay> [dah] <malay>kenapa</malay>

what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
(hmm)
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
thirty more seconds <malay>kita kena</malay> clap [eh] <malay>lepas ini</malay> or
<malay>habis</malay> just stop [jer]
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour
okay <malay>tak apa tak apa tak apa</malay> (uh) it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now

okay <malay>boleh dengar</malay>
all right
ya
<malay>kalau tidak nanti</malay> it becomes distorted
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit [ah]
is it
okay okay then <malay>aku</malay> adjust
the boundary [ah] okay <malay>aku baru pasang</malay>
shit
I don't know what went wrong [ah] honestly [ah] honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic [ah] I was like
okay [lah] <malay>aku tak buat salah</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I I don't see
even if I was the instructor
I wouldn't penalize myself (uh) just now [ah] maybe yesterday okay [lah] because yesterday <malay>aku macam kaku sikit</malay> because I didn't ride for very long right
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to [lah] but <malay>aku dah datang lambat semalam</malay>
<malay>semalam aku tak lambat</malay> so
then he started the face like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tahu macam oren penyet punya</malay> [kan] looking not happy like that so I was like okay [lah] I tell him I said okay I got experience like that (uh) (uh) <malay>kau</malay> experience <malay>kat mana aku cakap dulu</malay> I [oh] okay somebody go ask <malay>sampai</malay> back <malay>berapa</malay> then like (uh)
<malay>empat ke lima</malay> [ah] after second assessment
[oh] okay okay this one not for you go that one <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay>
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit [ah]
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike [ah]
and obviously I I kept stalling like I (um) not midway but I kept stalling at that place <malay>yang</malay> you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that [lah] so <malay>dia macam</malay> when I'm moving then <malay>dia</malay> stall stall stall <malay>gitu</malay>
but apart from that
I think
I don't see anything wrong with it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know [ah] cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that <malay>aku bawa</malay> maybe thirty five [ah] thirty or thirty five [ah] it break <malay>dia punya</malay> speed [ah]
so the the problem was (uh) okay that that was yesterday so <malay>aku faham</malay>
and I accepted it [lah] ya but today
(um) I started out with the mini circuit
I made less than less than ten rounds [ah] it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was (um) <malay>dia cakap</malay> okay (uh) he put two people out
like it was me and it was that that that that girl [lah] so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance [ah] maybe today I might pass [ah] that kind of thing
but no
<malay>tak nak</malay> [lah]
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
fact ni <malay>cakap</malay> I didn't even stall today <malay>macam</malay> because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice <malay>kepala otak dia</malay> [lah] need more practice at least you come and tell me <malay>macam</malay> maybe I did something wrong maybe <malay>aku terlalu laju</malay> or <malay>aku macam</malay> maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know <malay>ini macam</malay> guessing game you know or not like [oh] I asked him I asked me just now I said [oh] actually what what went wrong like
!wah! <malay>tadi kau</malay> okay (uh) everything okay breaking okay <malay>tak macam semalam</malay> cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
then I said [oh] then
then why I cannot the same ride again [ah]
[oh] <malay>takde apa-apa kau</malay> just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking <malay>kepala otak kau kau pun</malay> every prac <malay>kau pegang motor ke sama juga</malay> [kan] it's the same it's the same model [what] it's the same bike [what] what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated [lah] at that point of time then I just [ah] ya you know <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
so
[oh] so that was me and then about that girl
she was (um) she was okay she she also failed
but <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> failure <malay>aku faham</malay> because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really <malay>tergolek</malay> you know <malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about [ah] okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not <malay>yang belakang yang</malay> that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is <malay>hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan</malay> admin <malay>punya</malay> side
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back [ha] so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
time <malay>belok</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> turning [ah] <malay>ada</malay> cornering [ah] so
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
I was in front of her so <malay>aku bawa</malay> okay everything <malay>semua</malay> okay so I already made one round already
and then
and then the instructor <malay>pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk</malay> she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there [lah]
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror [lah] but I won't speeding I won't because that part <malay>memang</malay> you have to go down to get to that turn [what]
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place [eh] I already down to gear two already even before that [ah]
then <malay>aku belok sekali ada</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku ingat dia tengah baring</malay>
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there [ha] my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that [lah] that's why he stood there
because the other places where you turn <malay>ada orang</malay> it's quite open but that particular corner is is is [ha] <malay>memang</malay> seclude you cannot see anything there [ah]
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
[ha] then the instructor was like (uh) <malay>apa kau buat lagi</malay> !alamak! <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay> [kan] then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop [ah] stop and wait
then after that (uh) she was trying to pick up the mood
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left <malay>memang tak boleh</malay> [lah] of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you [ah] I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that [ah] so I guess <malay>takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke</malay>
no I was still on my bike
[ha] instructor instructor was there all the while [ha] so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say [eh] sorry [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> in your way I say nevermind it's okay [lah] you just
just do your thing [ah] then the instructor go and tell her some more you know [ha] <malay>masa dah buang ni lagi</malay>
[ha] you concentrate or your bike [ha] you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall [ah] because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver [lah] maneuver the the turn but she
she likes to <malay>macam himpit</malay> to the left side
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
[ha] cause it's it's a bend [what]
so no she probably got so close and after that she <malay>gabra</malay> because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
[ha] <malay>badan dia pula</malay> was on the other lane
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you <malay>kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia</malay>
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no [lah] I'm okay [lah] okay
and then after that (uh) she was trying to start the bike [ah] <malay>kelakar</malay> cause when she fell [kan] I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then <malay>apa</malay> she said [eh] (uh) I think my motorbike spoiled <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay> and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled <malay>dia ingat</malay> spoiled <malay>dia</malay> try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik [one] you cannot hear the engine starting [ah]
then after that like
!alamak! how <malay>ni</malay> [eh] <malay>gini gini gini</malay> then he go there he said this one your switch your switch [ha] check your switch okay
then <malay>dia</malay> begin
after that (uh) when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
(uh) the instructor tell me he said (uh)
<malay>takpe</malay> (uh) number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake <malay>takpe takpe takpe</malay> I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one [ah] so after that <malay>sampai habis</malay>
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her [kan] he say you just go ahead first [ah]
so I was just riding and riding and riding <malay>macam</malay> no problem [lah] to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one <malay>yang pakai</malay> bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying [ah] tall guy malay
<malay>muka dia macam mat</malay> [sial] <malay>sikit dia dia</malay> was on the he was on the he was at the bend <malay>yang depan lagi</malay> before you turn back into the the the admin area <malay>dia jatuh</malay> part <malay>sini kira</malay> square
<malay>macam ni</malay> [kan] admin area <malay>kat sini</malay> [kan] <malay>dia ada tempat sini si</malay> instructor <malay>lagi satu dia lepak sini</malay> the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed <malay>kau nak</malay> brake <malay>buat apa</malay> you're already breaking already [what] I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
<malay>macam</malay> you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice [ah] turn and like <malay>salah salah kau kena</malay> brake <malay>lagi kau kena</malay> brake <malay>lagi</malay> brake brake <malay>sebelum kau</malay> down gear brake <malay>kau nak</malay> brake <malay>apa</malay> [lah] [siol] so
at that point of time the more he talk the more <malay>aku</malay> #peng# [ah] but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three <malay>tudung</malay> girls in his class
[ha] prac one
<malay>tapi dia orang baru nak keluar</malay> [ah] so
<malay>aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa</malay> [ah] just want to start one again ya I guess normal [leh] you know whatever [lah] [eh]
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
for me [lah] as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong <malay>dia suruh aku main</malay> one two one two one two three <malay>aku</malay> one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
<malay>jadi</malay>
when I got the results I was like
the fuck [sial]
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
[ha] plank plank quite <malay>senang</malay> [what]
no to me
really [meh] you use your foot brake [what]
really
!huh!
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
[oh] class two ten seconds slower [ah]

the resemblance is there
you are listening [ha]
sell out your bike first
(mm)
(mm)
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think that you should consider that
you don't upgrade now [lah] #dol# you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten <malay>ke</malay> something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once <malay>kau dah</malay>
confident once <malay>kau rasa macam</malay> you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike [ha] that is five six years later you you change [ah] you don't have to <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I get class two <malay>sekarang juga aku nak tukar</malay> [ha]
there are many people who have class two bikes [ah]
but they all stop at super four
don't know
they just don't know they just don't about
it is it is it it
when you see their their their their how common the bike is [ah] on the roads [ah] that tells you how reliable the bike
super four there are people who bring super four which country in indonesia and come back down also also no problem super four quite normal or not ya
no I think it's six hundred (hmm) (mm)
four hundred two to two hundred to four hundred right two A
but ya (um) then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the <malay>lampu</malay>
but but the the the the aesthetic of me to say
<malay>sama aja</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[ah]
is it
ya
!huh!
per two weeks
[oh] engine oil to [oh] you change [ah] ya that's about two weeks [lah]
sixty
[oh] ya ya ya (mmhmm)
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four bottles <malay>mampus mampus</malay>
four four
that one S four that's why they call it super four
(mm)
ya [lah] because you got to change it frequently <malay>apa</malay>
forty eight ya
for every
[ah]
that's why you must get air cooled bike
get the tourer [ah] get the touring bike

it's nice
it looks like bro
[eh] but do you see the that one that day I showed you or not
the <malay>yang</malay> one ninety
it looks like the zontes right
but ya ya the zontes is bigger (uh)
the the the the <malay>apa</malay> the capacity capacity I think is
one eight four one eight four is a honda one and because it's the same engine as the as the tourism and the five [oh] but
<malay>dia punya</malay> tank [eh] <malay>dia punya</malay> tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
fifteen I think sixteen litres [ah]
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty
ya but the thing is a zontes <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>misal kata</malay> if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike <malay>mampus ke apa ke kat sana</malay> bro I'm dead [sia]

you can literally book everyday you know ya bro but that point of time I was still young I have no money so <malay>aku</malay> once in two weeks <malay>baru pergi</malay>
ya
you finish the next one once <malay>kau dah habis</malay> prac <malay>kau turun</malay> [eh] last time not <malay>turun</malay> last time it was the same level
you just finished it you go to the kerb you can book the next one <malay>kalau ada</malay> slot [lah]
[ha] and last time I [ha] and last time
the the chances of people sending their their their their slots like very high like everyday be lazy [what]
so
even when I was
even when I continued doing (uh) when in woodlands when I was staying at chinatown
<malay>pun ada juga</malay> I remembered my prac two and prac three was on the same day
(mm) <malay>kalau</malay> I book prac two (uh) in the afternoon I think it was one plus I finished my prac I pass I went to I went to different one
and that was about four plus so by the time <malay>ayah aku ambil aku</malay> was I remember was about seven plus
<malay>mati balik rumah ni</malay> [tau]
it's possible [lah]
but on that day there also three point two <malay>yang</malay> fail
I remember three point two E brake [ah]
brake <malay>aku laju sangat</malay>
fail
brake <malay>aku</malay> brake [ah] <malay>pakai dua-dua</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau tak</malay> jammed <malay>apa</malay>
no I think (uh) exceeded the line got exceeded the line
because <malay>aku</malay> was on gear one got less than two seconds <malay>lepas tu</malay> ram <malay>aku tukar jalan</malay> so basically that that gear two itself was was up to me me everybody
so by the time <malay>aku</malay> [ah]
so by the time <malay>aku dah nak sampai</malay> yellow light all I have to do is I just have to stop locating and then steer back down my my rear and and and front brake
the back also
but the the pullback you will feel [lah] because your engine breaking is active [what] [ah] then you really feel the thing on the the whole bike were you'll feel the jerk [ah]

it's not (uh) it's not a stop line
so I went to throttle but I think what happened was the the there was skid mark on the floor
so I throttle the whole bike went this way [sia]
I cannot turn
too fast already [ha] so just one thing slip so instead of the bike flying
the bike actually just drop <malay>aku pula yang</malay> slide cause it was <malay>licin</malay>

so by the time I reach back home
I was she was still texting me [ah] I was telling you everything [what]
then (uh)
<malay>apa ni</malay>
[ha] #nora# so when I was upstairs at level four <malay>tu</malay> then I saw one girl that look like her but I it didn't ring a bell to me I just
I just <malay>macam</malay> I just <malay>tengok dia</malay> just as as any other person [ah]
and then <malay>sekali</malay> she she looked at me and she's like
is that #dino#
<malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> I said ya [eh] <malay>nora macam tu</malay> thinking thinking thinking [eh] #nora buang# [eh] ya <malay>nora buang apa buat sini</malay> then she said [oh] <malay>tak</malay> I <malay>tengah buat</malay> then [oh] but I think she failed [lah]
see I I avoided the (uh) [ah] but she's okay [lah] she's quite cool [lah] <malay>dia</malay> then after that she she just saying [lah] then now she just interested to take bike two B <malay>juga</malay>
and then she said because she's been driving for many years already
then after that (uh) she was telling me [ah] no then
she ask me whether I was in contact with anybody from the deliveroo
then I said I said not really only sophie [ah] and then I don't know about you I say were you still there then she said no [lah] for some time already I'm not there I think she left
in october or something like that last year [ah] last year last year october
october [ah] october ke april april april sorry this year <malay>punya</malay> april she got retrenched because of COVID
but #dayah# ruby all went before her
first round of of of retrenchment #dayah# was the head of customer service [ah]
my head [lah] if she head of customer service [sial] [lah] no professionalism [sial] <malay>si bengap tu</malay>
[ah]
we used to order [lah] we used to order for dinner
after nine plus
eleven you are entitled to <malay>makan</malay> fifty dollars
per person ya
okay
normal [lah]
(mm) (mm)
now
is
clear cut dishonesty [sia]
terrible [ah]
of course [ah]
[ah]
you told me this one you told me
this one you told me but when was this this year
#dayah# smoke or no
I never seen her smoke ruby smokes #dayah# I don't know
I never see but #dayah# always try to act like the <malay>kakak-kakak</malay> in the office I cannot I cannot <malay>tahan</malay>
I really cannot <malay>tahan lagi dengan dia punya muka dengan dia punya</malay>
maybe [ah] <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> makeup <malay>dengan dia punya bontot gitu</malay> [kan] [eh] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [sia]
I mean you know honestly what [lah] just she's just
[kan] I told I told #shida# and her off before [what] #shida# and ruby off before at the office I think that from there already they won't come in I say you all you all treat the office like a playground
you know I never saw them in the corporate world
(mm)
but long time ago you still there [lah]
but I think on the day you were not working I I I didn't like #shida# from day one [one]
to me #shida# is just
a nuisance
I don't know how she was in youtrip [ah] but in deliveroo she was terrible
character wise
but ya [lah] that's the that's the that's the whole
and then rational why I I kind of didn't really like
I mean
I took that job because
and I came back from europe I had no job like literally nothing
ya no actually I ask you for it because you actually told me about the job before I went to europe and I said I don't want [ah] I said I didn't want cause you join them a few months (uh) two months before me nevermind <malay>aku cakap dengan kau aku tak nak</malay> [kan] I said don't want [lah] okay [lah] to me if that customer is <malay>dayah kau</malay> stay away from me [lah]
but when I came back to singapore I was like what to do <malay>aku takde duit</malay> [sia] then I was like work or not to work work on to work <malay>nak duit</malay> [ah]
then I message sophia <malay>tanya dia ada lubang ke tak</malay> but <malay>apa</malay> [tau] they were teasing you also like you said you forward it to keith and then I was asking you I say that this will get back to you and he say no whatever
then after that and then you give me keith's number then when I call keith ask me to come down come down <malay>bukan</malay> interview [sia] <malay>aku datang terus kerja</malay>
and then I'm like [ah] then I had to sign the the the stupid !huh! no last time attendance [kan] sign that that paper right what the the one in the hut the hut the hut
whatever [lah]
then I <malay>siap macam kena</malay> interview but he never interviewed until like one month later
(mm)
that's why ruby tried to start <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> with me but I was I wasn't really interested [ah] like ruby <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] when I came into the office already and someone was it was I remember someone when I came in like eleven o'clock shift or something like that <malay>kau dapat dalam</malay>
and then (um) I was sitting beside
(um) sophia B
then
sophia at that point of time I saw okay [lah] not bad [lah] at that point of time [ah] the woman <malay>dia buka dia punya mulut aku dah</malay> [ah] fuck man [ah] so <malay>aku macam</malay> [siol] [ah]
I don't know [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> pitching <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> the way she talks quite irritating <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
so <malay>aku</malay> just
the the random on that very first day of work [eh] <malay>lepas tu dia cakap jom hisap rokok aku tak nak</malay> sophie I say after lunch [lah] it's like [eh] <malay>jom hisap rokok turun</malay> the first she say
<malay>kau nak mati</malay>
ya I don't have I'm like
<malay>aku rasa aku ada</malay> [ah] during that time <malay>aku dengan erin dah dah dah</malay> on the rock <malay>aku rasa aku ada rasa</malay> [eh]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] I say no [lah] no [lah] I have I have
I just don't think my relationship will last [ah] then she was like [oh] take it slow take slow everybody got their hard place <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at that point <malay>dia punya laki masih kat dalam</malay>
<malay>sekarang aku tak tahu</malay>
where is she you also don't know where [ah]
<malay>sebab dia gila pangkat</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia gila pangkat</malay> but she's very she's very [ah] subtle [leh] cannot really predict what she's going to do <malay>dia</malay> very quiet <malay>tapi dia punya orang</malay> she knows want she wants and then she'll slowly #shida# told you [oh] and then she go and ya she told me she told me
then you telling me [one] <malay>kau tak boleh</malay> trust how the ya you told me I remember you had some issues before <malay>rabak</malay> [kan] <malay>aku pernah cakap dengan kau</malay> never ever trust anybody

okay [ah] first <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> regarding our hobby [lah] okay [ah] so you can first what is it your hobby
(um)
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>kalau</malay> for me my hobbies is [ah] I like to read books I like to travel I like to
[ah] mostly spend time <malay>dengan kawan-kawan ke apa</malay> [ah] that is my sort of hobbies that I like
[ah] I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really <malay>suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai</malay> I don't really like it
[ah] so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
(uh huh)
so other than
<malay>punya</malay> brand <malay>tak ada</malay> you don't have any other brand <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>suka ke apa ke</malay>
[kan] and I think you also <malay>suka</malay> Coach
you <malay>pun suka</malay>
[ah] quite lately [lah] I think that <malay>daripada dulu pun</malay> you <malay>memang suka</malay> Coach if not just lately
[ah] so <malay>apa lagi yang</malay> you
you <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>minat selain daripada</malay> bags
okay because for me [ah] whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore [kan] <malay>pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak</malay>
we <malay>apa</malay> more like
<malay>terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu</malay> [kan] so
when you
[ah] yes so is so now when you see for yourself [eh] actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
important the family <malay>makan</malay> and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like <malay>macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa</malay> it's edible [lah] <malay>boleh makan</malay> and there times <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>masak pada</malay> I is
(uh) fantastic [lah] it's good <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] I enjoy eating it which is something good [lah] [kan] hopefully
you can cook [ah] more things [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] the more the more rounder become most to most
[ah] exercise more [ah] exercise more in the imagination [lah] in reality I won't exercise
[ah] yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
[eh] this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya [lah] ten years ago still can play [lah] but now I think it'd be better
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore <malay>nak main bola dah susah</malay> I I try to ask my friends to play all
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play [ah] maybe
[ah] if I play football with
with #sharif# if the kid maybe can can be done <malay>ataupun</malay>
[ah] I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become [lah]
doubt so [lah] I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it [lah] don't want to waste my energy [ah]
during the malaysia cup [ah]
I think in terms <malay>kalau</malay>
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over [lah] first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
[ah] the whole society <malay>punya</malay> makeup <malay>pun dah</malay> changed I think now we are
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
[ah] whom is like
and the passion is just not there [lah] I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities [ah]
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> passion the thing is passion is there
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
<malay>budak-budak tak ada benda lain</malay>
<malay>budak-budak cuma</malay> only have
[ah] football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
to [ah] play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> when people play is
for the money for the fame [kan] then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
[ah] in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
[ah] I can just [ah] imagine myself to be #ronaldo# or #messi#
on the screen
[kan] if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if <malay>macam</malay>
now like <malay>dulu kalau kita nak tengok</malay> internet <malay>pakai</malay> computer will really stay in front of the computer
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers [kan]
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
<malay>tapi</malay> now even with handphone
you can basically
contact with the with the people
[kan] contact the people <malay>pun</malay>
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things [ah] (um)
(uh huh)
yes
ya so that is the different [lah] people change
[kan] so maybe certain things will be left behind [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] so the
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] the changes in in time [eh] so in order to survive
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time [lah] [kan] cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
[ah] mentality <malay>zaman dulu punya</malay> [kan] <malay>tak nak</malay> handphone <malay>tak nak pakai</malay>
[ah] internet [kan] I think <malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
[ah] impossible [ah] [kan] [ah]
okay (um)
yes
[ah] I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be <malay>apa terlalu ke belakang</malay> if let's say we are too far
[ah] behind [kan] then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
[ah] just nice for his [ah]
or his or her development
in the future [lah] even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
[ah] [ah]
yes correct
[ah]
(um)
[ah]
ya [lah]
have to have to try [lah] [kan] <malay>tu kadang-kadang</malay> when we try <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>susah juga nak nak</malay> catch up [kan] but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that [lah] [kan] okay <malay>sekarang nak</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal apa</malay> topic <malay>lain</malay>
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
[ah]
[ah] but in terms of travelling
<malay>kita takde</malay> [lah] travel <malay>banyak-banyak tempat</malay> [kan] [ah] so for our travel is mostly to
[ah] malaysia [kan]
[ah] [ah] maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia [ah]
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
[ah] (um)
[ah] if not we will be like <malay>apa</malay> every year at least [lah]
[ah] favourite place [ah] favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay [lah] our singapore dollar is strong [lah] then
I think <malay>bila kita pergi tu apa boleh</malay>
so hope <malay>macam apa</malay> we can
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe [kan]
so <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa</malay> [lah]
but it's a really complete
(uh) shopping [lah]
for the clothes only [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
what are the [ah] pattern what is the <malay>perangai yang kita boleh</malay>
[ah] click <malay>atau tak</malay> click what is our
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay [kan] but of course there is there different [lah] when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new [kan] but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is [ah] is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
(err) <malay>kalau bawa</malay>
our kid also will enjoy it more also [lah] [kan]
(uh) but
yes [ah]
[ah] ya [lah] you will set the goal when you go [ah]
[ah] [ah]
[ah] I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part [lah] [kan]
I mean
ya [lah] I think certain things you are more
[ah]
comfortable in handling and
[ah] certain things I am more comfortable in handling [lah] I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
[ah] planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
ya [lah] [ah] when authoritative-ness then
[ah] <malay>apa</malay>
people don't argue with you
[ah] yes [lah] you can <malay>ke depan</malay> [lah]
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
[ah] then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
[ah]
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay [lah]
[ah]
<malay>takda</malay> [lah] at least [kan]
we are realistic [lah] [kan] what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over [lah] I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small [lah] but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it [kan] so that is the difference
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya
I think for the #jakarta# [one]
when we reach
there we were like [eh]
first thing is the airport [lah]
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
(err) shopping centres (err) in the eighties [kan]
so okay [lah] that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
(uh)
[ah]
ya when we first <malay>sampai</malay> the hotel <malay>tu</malay>
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
[ah] something being kept for so long
it's not rotten [ah] it's like the carpet never wash for so long
[ah] [lah]
[kan] <malay>bila kita sampai</malay>
<malay>bilik tu macam</malay> okay everything go like so olden
[kan] [ah] [ah] so after <malay>lepas dah</malay> the <malay>bilik tu</malay> okay [lah] but overall
quite enjoyable [lah] in #jakarta# the
different way of life
[ah]

[ah] our wedding planner [ah]
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) [ah] yes

(um) [ah]
[ah] the third
[ah]
hotel
basically is [ah] it's all paid for
the tour is [ah]
the tour is all planned [ah] so the driver the vehicle all all is provided
basically we are just supposed to
be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow [eh]
[ah]
testing [ah] [ah]
#tanah abang#
yes
[ah]
so sometimes [kan] you have to buy <malay>kadang-kadang macam apa</malay>
have to buy clothes same pattern but different colours [kan]
just for the sake of
[ah] getting (err)
cheaper cheaper price [ah] [kan]
because [ah] <malay>dorang tak jual</malay>
they don't sell by one piece one piece
they sell by [oh] you must buy at least three must buy at least four and
so that's why <malay>kadang bila kita</malay> when
we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore
(err)
<malay>dorang beli</malay> to sell at their shop <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
is money yes
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
ask for directions
<malay>nak pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>itu bukan itu aja</malay> even someone who
open the door for us
just holding the door still will be expecting us to
to <malay>kasi duit</malay>
then <malay>dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua</malay> [kan] [ah]
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] [kan] so other than that

they like to conserve the old buildings
so <malay>macam kalau apa</malay> even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building <malay>tu di apa</malay>
they conserve so they make it part of the building [kan] which is [ah] a bit
a bit <malay>macam</malay> odd [lah] something good
but
[kan] <malay>kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia</malay>
conserve for the sake of [ah] conserving [ah] sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them [lah] cause they did conserve their [ah]

[ah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) yes
family members [ah] [ah]
so other than that for me is (err) [ah]
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
[ah] maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated [lah] trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people <malay>pun</malay> move other parts of this [one] is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family <malay>pun</malay> move <malay>kalau kita punya</malay> situation [kan] and got a kid
to <malay>jaga</malay> [kan] to <malay>jaga</malay> we got a special needs <malay>adik</malay> to <malay>jaga</malay> [kan] so but okay [lah] I think it can be done [lah] it will be difficult sacrifice <malay>perlu dibuat</malay> [kan] <malay>cuma</malay> hope to <malay>apa</malay>
hope <malay>lagi banyak benda kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> will work out [lah] [kan]
the vision is clear [kan] [ah] our vision is clear [kan] of course <malay>kalau budak susah nak faham</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>tapi kata orang pun kita</malay> lead we lead [kan] most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay>
of course [lah] <malay>kadang ada orang</malay> selfish <malay>apa</malay> [kan] so if
that person selfish <malay>tak nak</malay> cooperate [kan]
I will go with the majority [lah] and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue [oh] then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
I will do it [lah] <malay>tapi kalau dah tak boleh</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku dah cakap kau tak nak dengar</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> get into <malay>masalah</malay>
<malay>kau suruh aku</malay> handle <malay>aku</malay> I feel <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] <malay>tak apa tak adil tak adil</malay> [kan] so I will always go for fairness
[ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
[eh] [lah]
<malay>leher</malay> [ah]
yes the neck <malay>tapi macam</malay> the neck only can show where to turn
[kan] <malay>tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang</malay> decide <malay>nak</malay> turn <malay>atau tidak</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya [kan] so <malay>sebab itu kita</malay> as a <malay>keluarga</malay> we are as a unit [kan] so we want to move we want to move as a unit
<malay>kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini</malay> [kan] then <malay>kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat</malay>
<malay>dia tak</malay>
affect <malay>tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah</malay> then
really have to <malay>apa</malay> explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue [lah] [kan] so the issue now is whether <malay>dapat</malay> settle <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> hopefully <malay>akan dapat</malay> settle [lah] [kan]
<malay>dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] I don't want to <malay>halang</malay>
<malay>kalau dia nak</malay> [kan] <malay>kita akan</malay> we are
[ah]
in terms of <malay>nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] yes
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>ubat</malay>
[ah] yes
[ah] cousin [ah]
<malay>tergantung</malay> it's very <malay>susah</malay> [lah] then
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best [lah]
I I submit document I submit application
<malay>semua dah buat</malay> [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
the thing is is like that
[kan] <malay>kata orang tu</malay> [kan]
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother [lah] [kan]
but now the organisation <malay>bukan satu tempat</malay>
they are two different organisations so <malay>yang ini tempat</malay> check
<malay>yang ini untuk</malay>
[ah] <malay>masa depan</malay>
for future <malay>yang ini untuk apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain</malay> so
have to go through a lot of places [lah]
whether it will improve <malay>ke tak</malay>
the future
<malay>tak juga dia</malay> different criteria [kan] like example <malay>kalau macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> in order to apply for example [ah] to apply for need
[ah] certification that he is autistic then <malay>dah pergi</malay> minds minds <malay>dah</malay> certify <malay>dia dah</malay> [ah] settle
then after that <malay>nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula</malay> [oh]
certification from (uh) minds <malay>tak cukup</malay>
you have to go through a certain
[ah] doctor [lah] doctor or hospital or what okay so <malay>pergi</malay> doctor <malay>punya</malay> hospital
happen doctor hospital <malay>tu pun</malay> [ah] okay [lah] willing to help okay he did that part
then after that <malay>bila nak</malay> apply for <malay>apa</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> cash in life for home caregiving [kan] [oh]
cannot we only we only accept those who are <malay>apa</malay>
authorised by us to do the [ah] assessment so go through check up again
so (um) (um)
[ah] [ah]
<malay>risiko</malay> there and the the thing is
okay [lah] <malay>macam cakap macam macam kita ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> for <malay>macam untuk adik ni</malay>
I am willing to <malay>usaha</malay> [kan] and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support [lah]
so <malay>kita kena buat</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi macam</malay> you try imagine
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] all these checks
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done [kan]
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then [ah]
yes correct and the thing is <malay>pula</malay>
<malay>kita pergi</malay> check up <malay>ni bukan</malay> free
everytime <malay>pergi</malay>
[ah] <malay>kena bayar ke apa</malay> [kan] but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds <malay>tolong</malay>
<malay>percuma</malay> free
[ah] even the hospital [one] happen epilepsy <malay>punya</malay> doctor [kan] so there is no extra charges [lah] and
[ah] so <malay>nanti</malay> Q cure <malay>ni kalau macam apa</malay>
in order <malay>dah dapat</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>apa ni semua</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>pula nak kena</malay> assessment [kan]
and then the assessment <malay>pun</malay> need another set of [ah] check up
[kan] [lah] so <malay>memang susah</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>duit apa</malay>
I think now is
[ah]
<malay>kita bukan harap</malay> [ah] [ah] at least <malay>dia</malay> improve

so <malay>macam</malay> #bud# okay
I heard there's a lot of barber shop [ah] nowadays
but then how they make money in the first place <malay>kau tahu tak</malay>
ya I think there are people who like <malay>macam</malay> every three weeks they will go for a haircut
!wah! if I !wah! cannot afford [ah] <malay>rabak</malay> seriously
ya but I saw it's like forty dollars what's so special about the forty dollars [sia]
but it's more I I don't know if actually I I I really cannot afford [lah]
the haircuts [lah] I just go to normal neighbourhood barber shops like <malay>bawah</malay> block <malay>punya</malay>
and the <malay>pakcik</malay> will cut your hair and it's really I think that's more comforting [ah] cause cause I see all these young people do [ah] and then the places
that they make the shop that they make [ah] is very intimidating you know you know like sometimes you <malay>takut</malay> you know you'll be like
[eh] what's this [ah] why they all this <malay>abang-abang</malay> like
got tattoo [lah] you know for normal people [ah] I will scared [lah]
ya
ya but normally
when I go there I sit down
then the <malay>pakcik</malay> will be like [eh] [ah] <malay>sekolah</malay> [eh]
then like [oh] <malay>sekolah ke kerja</malay> then like [oh] <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] [oh] <malay>ni</malay>
ya but I normally go there only when I go reservist ya to make my hair short [ah]
ya
same [ah]
ya same same
ya but during circuit circuit breaker what you do actually
ya
ya but I remember that time we always zoom
we zoom every I don't know once
one week I don't know three or four times [sia] we zoom
!wah! <malay>gila</malay> [eh] thirty days
ya but to me it's a very weird weird experience [ah] cause for us singaporeans cause we we always <malay>lepak</malay> [what] like every weekend we always see each other we are lucky to be in singapore where where things are like small then we can travel everywhere within one hour then we also have our own friends that we always hang out with
but then <malay>sekali kena</malay> the circuit breaker
cannot <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] cannot do this cannot do that [lah] but then we still <malay>lepak</malay> at zoom [ah] so is (uh) I don't know [ah] it's very it's very weird feeling I hope
it's fun but I but I don't think we
ya is different [ah] I don't know [ah] to me is very weird [ah]
ya ya
ya I think we are lucky [lah] we got friends who are like
<malay>semangat</malay> [lah] want to still want to <malay>lepak</malay> cause I know is is [ah] very very difficult for other people also [ah] those who no got no support from friends during this circuit breaker !wah! that one <malay>rabak</malay> that one sure <malay>rabak</malay>
ya
ya
then some more if you stay in a family then you don't like the family I mean your family everytime <malay>gaduh</malay> everytime quarrel !wah! that one more more worse [sia] that one

but they all working what [lah] they never
no actually I don't know [ah]
ya
ya
ya
but at least you need to work full-time for like three five years know if you want to commit to that to buy get your own place [ah] as with a actually couple more easier [ah] not
not alone cause couple you can get a lot of (err) loans and (err) whatever other stuff
ya
ya
but actually sucks [eh]
if you notice [ah] houses sucks [eh] very small I cannot [sia] I cannot imagine myself in I mean I'm just saying [ah] even though I'm not planning to buy a house but if I can buy house [ah] I just take resale
ya ya
no but the feel different know if you notice the feel if you go to house you <malay>masuk</malay> like all our friends all like #wal# house [lah] [eh] I think #wal# house small [ah]
#mamat# house like same as #wal# house [ah]
ya #zafran# house very big I think that's the earlier earlier
#hud# house same like #yadi# house [ah]
#yadi# house ya ya the kitchen
(mm)
ya ya ya I don't know [ah]
I heard I heard estee also want to get married october
estee

ya next year [ah]
good for good for her [lah]
I think she good at managing money [ah]
ya ya ya
ya
but now she working part-time
ya
part-time or casual [ah]
ya it's true [ah] part-time
ya
at the [eh]
no no no the outram one
(mm)
ya ya ya
exactly
[eh] [sial] [lah] if <malay>bagi aku rabak</malay> #dok#
<malay>aku</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] [sial]
<malay>aku</malay> stress
stress [sia] <malay>aku macam nak pergi luar negeri</malay> [sia] <malay>cabut tak</malay> [lah] <malay>main-main</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> okay
ya
<malay>hari tu dekat</malay> rubik's jam
!huh!
<malay>asal</malay>
<malay>abeh dorang</malay> book
!huh!
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
ya
exactly
ya actually we also plan to record but now no mood [ah]
don't know [lah] if [sial] if [sial] is
have to <malay>bungkus</malay> [ah]
<malay>bungkus</malay> [ah]
ya but wasted [ah] I think [sial] very special cause of the style
cause of its music
ya no [lah] but the reason why this band is easy to tour in the first place remember <malay>macam</malay> #zad# (err) freelance #zafran# also
freelance I also freelance #siti# but then now !aiyo! ya that's why I make postpacs
cause I'm bored
and then
I like
trying to <malay>kumpul duit</malay> [ah] to buy gear to for live setup
ya
so that the reason why <malay>aku selalu</malay> form band <malay>pasal aku suka pergi</malay> tour
<malay>pasal kalau kau pergi</malay> tour you get to see the world
and then when I see the world cheap [ah]
ya
ya little cost but sometimes hectic [ah]
for me you don't really get to see a lot of stuff of course you just go to one place
for I don't know twenty four hours or less than twenty four hours sometimes
then you #chao# [what] you #chao# to next city
ya
ya of course
power [ah]
ya
very sucky
ya
ya
ya but the best I think
after you play then you make friends
but then these people become your friends then maybe next time you can visit them I mean next time you can go on tour with other bands it's like that [ah] it's it's it's creating a network [ah]
ya
ya
ya
cause me and #zafran# have the same thinking like that every time
#zafran# more cool [sia] got kid all got other thing but still want to do all these
like#zad# he a bit different I think sadly <malay>macam</malay>
don't know [ah] like picky [ah] or ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya
ya but to me if I'm out of here [ah] I okay already

<malay>tak payah</malay> mark <malay>sebab dia tak ada</malay>
ya [lah] we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya [lah]
ya so I think what we can do we don't go (uh) we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual [lah] we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in [ah]
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay [lah] (uh) we can take the the voucher [ah] you want to buy the voucher [ah] meaning we have to go (uh) the
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
(err)
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course [ah]
no [lah] the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before [what] just like the night safari
the four items [ah] the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
(err)
think eleven plus [ah]
[oh] (uh) wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge [ah] seven plus to nine
two you (uh) ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this [one] right
(uh) we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going [what] you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go [lah]
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also [lah] can
the three of them
but if #affaf# don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two [lah]
then it's two two each
Subway
[oh] over there got <malay>itu apa</malay> Marybrown
(mm) ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough [lah] don't know ya
have to
is the camera (uh) waterproof
don't have [ah]
can
#affaf# <malay>punya bukan dua lagi tu</malay>
<malay>si</malay> #affaf# <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] because her
her studies finish already [what] her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
(uh) the other two they don't need to go <malay>pun</malay>
knowing <malay>si apa</malay> knowing <malay>si</malay>
(err)
#affif# I think he doesn't want to go down
[eh] what
twentieth right
the following week [lah] after christmas
can [eh] no cannot
yes (uh) (uh)
cannot
<malay>dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
<malay>kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh</malay> if we go out I keep saying to the kids
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have [ah] not open yet [ah] okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups [lah] so the kids
all the children
add up (uh)
it's just nice
it's just nice eight eight person the children <malay>saja</malay>
force [lah]
monday
that's why first person to check is #aisyah#
I mean if you don't want to <malay>leceh</malay> then just do it at home [lah] <malay>kat rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
but if you I I don't know whether
(err)
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
one you contact <malay>kak</malay> #ogi#
then you ask her
then if she what he say [lah] you ask her for her opinion and all
then what what she say [lah] then after that <malay>baru</malay>
get the ball rolling
cause I think for us <malay>kita yang tak jumpa</malay> #aisyah# <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>si kecil tu</malay> at least <malay>kak</malay> #ogi# <malay>jumpa juga</malay> [lah] once and then <malay>ayah tu jumpa</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita langsung tak jumpa</malay>
since
<malay>bila raya</malay> [lah]
<malay>raya dia tunggu kita kita datang lambat kita ingatkan dia balik rupanya dia menunggu kita</malay>
think <malay>raya haji tak salah</malay>
[eh] <malay>buat juga</malay> [lah]
so my family side I can suggest
<malay>macam</malay> okay so it depends
(uh) ya [lah] there is a few suggestion [lah] one is
(uh) because <malay>sekarang ni yang paling ramai</malay> is either #mahir# or #amin#
[kan] <malay>kat rumah yang paling ramai</malay> so we either go to #mahir's# house or #amin's# house
<malay>kalau si</malay> #lina# <malay>dia</malay> happy <malay>kat rumah</malay> #amin# [ah] because it's more <malay>apa orang tu tak ada kucing</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> so <malay>ertinya</malay> we cannot come one time <malay>pun</malay> it's just <malay>macam contoh</malay> [lah] [eh]
(um) we split into two groups
so one group is maybe (uh)
<malay>kita dengan mak</malay>
so <malay>kita bawa mak dengan si</malay> #matin#
<malay>pergi rumah</malay> #amin# so <malay>kita lapan orang</malay> [lah] <malay>kita jumpa</malay> #amin# <malay>dengan budak-budak tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] then second group could be #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir#
<malay>bawa</malay> the children [ah]
[ah] [eh] [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir# <malay>dah tak boleh</malay> [eh]
ya
<malay>tak boleh</malay> eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why <malay>kalau nak jumpa kena macam</malay>
go to the one that is more [lah] [kan]
so <malay>contoh contoh</malay> [eh]
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there [lah]
so #affif# #affaf# #shafie# three
then (uh) maybe #mahir# send his kids but <malay>dah berapa</malay>
seven plus (uh) <malay>si kecil tu</malay> #akil# #akif#
<malay>dah lapan</malay>
<malay>anak</malay> #amin# <malay>kat rumah dia</malay> so already join in [lah]
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
[ah] #adoi# ya [lah] but if <malay>nak</malay> have a cousin gathering then can
and I think they don't mind [lah] because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya [lah]
but I think if it's like just cousins
get together before <malay>ini</malay> I think maybe okay [lah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let say it is (um)
so (uh) <malay>apa</malay> all the cousins meet one time
then okay <malay>balik</malay>
then
<malay>tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu</malay> okay <malay>kalau macam gitu</malay>
<malay>anak-anak saudara</malay> [jer]
you have how many (uh) eight plus four twelve
twelve children
so they can't sit together <malay>pun</malay> I mean they won't sit together <malay>pun</malay>
correct <malay>kalau dekat rumah</malay> #amin# <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang bermain</malay>
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
so to me <malay>biar anak-anak saudara ni semua</malay> all the children can come down at one time
then they
(mm) <malay>asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit</malay>
<malay>kita biar budak-budak semua pergi</malay> #amin# you handle the kids
<malay>kita</malay> (uh) adults alright bye bye <malay>kita</malay> go for our
K if it's a red line [ah] and it's too (um)
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
[ah]
#amin# I mean we all have been coming over
we [ah] #mahir# because the other time his family come over #amin# come over #amin# the whole family his whole family come over
so and then #andir# <malay>selalu</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay>
so it's not like <malay>ini</malay> [lah] it's the together <malay>ramai-ramai yang tak ada</malay>
okay do how [ah]
(uh)
ya [lah] (uh) we can give suggestions and then let them think
so one of my suggestion is that [lah] (uh) let the kids all <malay>kumpul kat rumah si</malay> #amin# so at least the kids
<malay>cari penyakit tu namanya</malay>
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest #amin# would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
(uh) at one time at one go
and then (err)
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay [lah] then after that
of course [lah]
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
[ah] apply
once you step out the house <malay>tak boleh</malay>
okay other than that then they all meet at <malay>tu</malay> their <malay>ayah teh</malay> house
<malay>ayah teh</malay> will be very happy all come come come
just that maybe #amin# (uh) only
the two older [eh] #umar# also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if #umar# is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
<malay>abang</malay> is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
K so
(mm)
right okay so what else [ah] do you want to talk about (um)
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya [lah]
very difficult
ya cannot [one]
the night safari
how and what else can we do with <malay>mama</malay>
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
then we <malay>ajak mak</malay>
twenty
that weekend [ah] the christmas weekend twenty six <malay>ke</malay> twenty seven
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
so if let's say you want to <malay>pergi pun boleh pakai</malay> wheelchair <malay>kat situ</malay>
or jewel
jewel [kan] <malay>dia ada</malay> all those (uh) tours right
<malay>pergi jalan</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> waterfall [lah]
the the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>atas tu ada</malay> the the <malay>apa</malay>
the
ya
we we also haven't gone [what] we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options [lah] so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ada cakap apa semalam</malay> wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
<malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> own timing
not today is tomorrow <malay>kakak dia ajak</malay> tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want <malay>memang</malay> he already say he (uh) a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
no
so okay [lah] at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that [one]
no the problem is
all others in singapore [lah] unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to [what]
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
ya that's why that's why I say so <malay>lepas ni</malay> she have to go to <malay>apa ni</malay>
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
because I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay>
(um) the problem with all other (uh) uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's (uh) and her lecturer one whom she took the last course [kan]
that lecturer <malay>yang</malay> quite good [lah] she talk to him quite a bit
then she the lecturer actually say (um)
that
if you he teach at these two uni <malay>dua-dua</malay> uni <malay>dia ajar</malay>
murdoch [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> northumbria so <malay>dia ajar</malay>
a topic module not on in these two uni [lah]
so <malay>dia kata memang kat</malay> northumbria
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
whereas <malay>dekat</malay> murdoch
you <malay>dah buat</malay> all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
(err) coursework [lah] another <malay>apa</malay> testing test
you have to write [ah] [ah] correct
so she's (uh) worried about the that part [lah] that's why
no she already <malay>memang</malay> in this line
<malay>dia dah memang buat</malay> communication so she can
(uh huh) ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya [lah]
they actually have it [leh] the last time she say they the
officers came into the class and <malay>dah</malay> explain <malay>pun</malay> everything <malay>tapi</malay> (uh)
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
even that <malay>wira</malay> guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go [lah]
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants [ah]
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
(err)
(mm) more working people are opting for that course more working people [tau] meaning people who are
let's say they (uh) they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us [lah] she (uh) or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student [ah] so she will be like considered as an adult already [lah]
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say (uh)
(err) income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
[ah] but actually that [one] not much [lah]
of course [lah] because she is [ah]
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
(uh) adult already <malay>cuma</malay> I don't know in terms of
(uh)
ya [lah]
like that [lah]
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have (uh) all these other
unis [ah] which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
[oh] my god that's why I was
ya [lah] because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
and then now they tell us <malay>dah tak ada</malay> (uh) two time
it's very frustrating [lah]
ya so that [one] actually I thought (uh) I want to sit down with her and go through all the
all [ah] all of the <malay>ni</malay> ya
ya [lah]
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
ya [lah] so for example the other time <malay>dia pergi</malay> M
<malay>tu</malay> actually not bad and I saw the programme <malay>pun macam bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>dia ada</malay> sound recording space
all those things [lah] so and she went in they were all telling her [oh] you know (uh) this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like #affaf# are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop (uh)
K so
we need another
ya we need another (uh)
round of her checking [lah] ya for her to check
<malay>mana kawan dia</malay> <malay>atau</malay> overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up [lah] and say okay go maybe australia <malay>ke mana</malay>
practise <malay>apa maksudnya</malay>
that's why okay another option is <malay>tengok dekat</malay> malaysia
because malaysia <malay>pun banyak</malay> twinning programme
and twinning programme <malay>dia pun</malay> not bad quite good
<malay>anak ustaz</malay> [ah]
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
[ah] so actually we just limit it to singapore <malay>cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil</malay> kaplan
so with that diploma <malay>kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain</malay>
one more year <malay>tapi</malay> it's just one more year ya [lah]
ya [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dia</malay> at the end of the day <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak ni nak buat</malay> #shafie# <malay>mati-mati nak buat</malay> photography right he wants to be a photographer
that's what he wants to do
so
ya [lah] she
[lah]
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based [lah] so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics [lah] right that's physics right
so more about physics
[ah] so you learn how to make
the (uh) you learn what is the because
#shafie# <malay>dia</malay> once he is focused on
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
so that part is good [lah] he <malay>kalau betul-betul</malay> interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya [lah] you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
(um)
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application (uh) by this person
who wants to (uh) (uh) okay because I put up (uh) a post
[ah] resale
ya okay so two [ah] one is about the
(um) recruitment
(uh) I put
teacher coach (uh) at SAM [lah]
so so far
(uh)
two person submit one is a malay girl who
<malay>bukan yang dia</malay> she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like !huh! <malay>apa kejadah ni</malay> so she apply K
the other one is an indian lady
(uh) <malay>anak tiga ke apa tak tahu</malay> she is she used to teach in preschool
used to teach english
so she (uh) she apply but we are maths [kan] so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
[ah] that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because (uh) we already signed up [what] it's for free at that point in time [lah]
(uh) when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say (uh) this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
(uh) about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
[ah]
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can <malay>macam</malay>
switch her [lah]
ya
ya [lah] paying the teacher only
correct [lah]
ya [lah] I mean that is not the whole idea <malay>pun</malay> the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so <malay>kalau</malay> let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources <malay>pun</malay>
so okay [lah] so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
(um) a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
you you go and pause <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] my god
<malay>putus</malay>
no [lah] <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tekan</malay> the other side [oh] my god [oh] my god okay
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
[oh] he he message he say <malay>kak</malay> I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run [ah] let it run [ah]
but if if if cannot get the numbers <malay>itu yang ini</malay> [kan]
so the partnership confirm don't want [ah] so I will message to say don't want [ah]
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya [lah] the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
session <malay>tu yang</malay> I told #ira# #ira# <malay>kalau</malay> let's say parents <malay>datang</malay> they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session [ah] I <malay>cakap</malay>
because you can still do the assessment on the first day <malay>dia datang tu</malay> you can do
[ah]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say <malay>dia</malay>
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
so <malay>dia</malay> accept <malay>dia</malay> P three still have to give the
the worksheets for P three right [ah]
if ya so on the first day <malay>dia datang</malay>
<malay>dia buat</malay> the assessment <malay>dulu</malay> that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue [lah] from there [kan]
so #ira# <malay>angguk-angguk</malay> don't whether she <malay>faham ke</malay> she agree <malay>ke</malay> will do <malay>ke tak tahu</malay>
okay so
progress report I told #ira# to do that already
I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> print the progress report do the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
so that tomorrow we print out <malay>semua</malay> all one time [lah] so that's why I want to know what is it
that's what you said to #ira# right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of #ira# you said to #ira# directly
I was there so I think it's okay [lah] let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out [lah]
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
I don't know [eh] to me <malay>macam</malay> it's okay [lah] you just print out <malay>pun</malay> okay black and white <malay>apa</malay>
can't be bothered to
don't have to <malay>turun</malay> you have to pass to the children
and then we message the parents we have passed the
(uh) final <malay>apa</malay> the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
<malay>kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi</malay> on in june
july right we're supposed to give (uh) first week july then we didn't give
so this [one] at least we give [lah] everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya [lor]
but then
buy over then he buy over [lah]
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
(uh) for (uh) the person who takes over is a full time
owner
[tau] so he was saying
(uh) Kumon <malay>pun cakap</malay> the same thing
so he the new centre <malay>yang dia nak</malay> run (uh) a franchise <malay>tu</malay>
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved [lah]
(uh) in
ya sort of like that [lah] ya correct
but I was thinking actually no [lah] (uh) #yang# was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut [lah] so I think he can
ya [lah] he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said [lah] a bit
you know I said (uh) (uh) in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot [ah] then I say during and all ya ya ya
(uh) I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only [ah] I can understand a bit but
(uh) chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say [oh] because
(uh) nearby our place (uh) it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so (uh) a lot of (uh)
(uh)
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
[ah]
then then (uh) because of that
(um) we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
[oh] okay okay but now got Google translate [what]
can just (uh) tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear [lah]
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say [oh] but the children can speak english [what] so the children can explain I say yes
(um) we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had (uh) chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy [lah]
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just [oh] okay
[ah] [ah]
[ah] that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct [lah] ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
okay so he has been teaching when he was in (um) school <malay>dulu dia mengajar</malay>

but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can <malay>macam</malay>

ya I saw the picture then after that you <malay>terus tukar daripada gambar jadi</malay> message from <malay>gambar</malay> then it become a message that is where <malay>saya macam</malay>
(mmhmm)
so that that was the part when I actually [eh] [ah] you ask you ask me cake because you didn't mention macaron <malay>lagi</malay> so it was just cake

okay [ah] I I could be right <malay>betul saya rasa ada</malay> chance <malay>betul</malay>
but because usually cake <malay>tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu</malay> they need to <malay>susun letak</malay> and then they <malay>macam [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] [a'ah] [ah] (mmhmm)

not being good leaders that kind of thing [ah] and then he he agree to it [lah] and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be <malay>macam</malay> have a leadership have leadership [ah] responsibility like old people <malay>dorang</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay [ah] simply put I also understand [ah] <malay>dia cakap macam</malay> nowadays (err) parents okay <malay>macam dia cakap</malay> parents usually <malay>perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan</malay> very strict <malay>semua tak boleh</malay> ya <malay>dia macam</malay> partly part

the malay teacher [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay>
<malay>cikgu ahmad suki</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
[ah] so <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
I think somebody which
I think later I show you I think I have a picture no no not really <malay>botak botak</malay>
he's a bit a bit bald
but now as age catch up you don't really recognize him until somebody pointed out then [eh] isn't that (err) <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay> then [eh]
[eh] ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression [lah] I mean
they they have to retire [what] once they they hit their sixties
have the energy [lah]
professorship
ya [lah] I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
<malay>sayang</malay> we are the millennials <malay>sayang</malay>
yes
<malay>sayang</malay> millennials starts
yes I'm millennial [ah]
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch [lah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
even my brother is millennial
my brother #naz#
so #naz# is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation [lah]
no she she got (uh) she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot [lah] but
but if she can if she can you know (err) ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya [lah] but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation [lah] I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made (err)
make a profit [lah] but the thing is if she
ya [lah] about one point one million [lah] but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
(mm)
how much she bought it
but her one is at #simei# right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand (uh)
thirteen years ago
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand [lah]
!huh!
so just just
(uh) amber road
[ah]
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal [lah] because (err)
[oh] so new [lah]
well that's a risk
development
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah]
but her place second floor
what one point
[oh]
her main bedroom
[oh] cause so it's quite big [lah]
ya okay but
(uh huh)
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
#dasha# when she can save more money right
(mmhmm)
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person [what]
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more [what] if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored [lah] then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means (err) in the embassy one is paying for her living space [eh] if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I mean [kan] <malay>ini duit</malay> I mean <malay>kalau</malay>
I mean now okay [lah] maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya [lah] but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury (uh) apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense [what]
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people [lah]
say about thousand plus [ah] ya maybe [ah]
okay
if six person ya [lah] if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya [lah] make sense [lah]
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy [lah] one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy (err) is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya [lah] I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo [lah] so that
they are being sheltered [lah]
fixed condo
[ah]
[ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they (uh) being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but (err) when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference [ah] cause
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes (err) what drives what drives people
(mm)
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
(err) flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
(mmhmm)
how much
ya that's quite a lot
[oh] [eh] so he's the degree [lah]
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh huh)
#eton# what's a #eton#
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore [lah]
[oh]
depend on the area [lah] depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese [leh]
the vietnamese might like my friend the <malay>tuan</malay> the guy
he's (err) he knows (err) he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese (err) they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area [lah] maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence [ah]
(mm)
!huh! russia
I know a few I know a few malaysian but they they study in scotland [ah] <malay>yang irfan punya kawan</malay> scotland scotland
but is it recognized or not in singapore
(uh huh)
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
the recognition you know like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] malaysian malaysia hospital [lah]
[oh] okay and then then okay [lah]
because if not wasted [kan] <malay>kalau tak</malay> recognize and then after all the effort
[ah]
[oh] why [ah]
wasted [kan]
medicine also medicine [what]
[oh]
[oh] okay
[eh] [oh] (err) #rundy# #rundy#
#rundy# #rundy#
(uh) ireland or scotland [ah]
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand [ah]
four hundred thousand
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya most I suggest
most of them they they love like all my army friends army friends (uh) <malay>nama dia</malay> #kartik#
#kartik# <malay>dia</malay> just I just saw from facebook he
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait [ah] can remain thirteen fourteen
after fourteen years <malay>dah bukan jadi</malay> principal
most of my friends
in singapore
(mm)
I think the highest I heard is [jer] [lah]
so not not easy
but in in in
<malay>macam</malay> australian <malay>ni semua</malay> I think it's I wouldn't say it's it's easier
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback [ah]
(uh)
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge [ah]
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh)
I think ya [lah] because the the guys are not
are not <malay>madrasah</malay> train so they have more
no no the the
#adi# is secular #adi# is <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that he went to secular but for no #ahmad# is (err) all the way is
(err) secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
so <malay>macam</malay> like for
for the girls they
they're they're
[ah] because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which [ah] no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences [ah]
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option

<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>takde orang</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia kesian</malay> you know <malay>aku punya kawan macam dia</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang pun yang jaga dia</malay> it's like the father and the maid <malay>apa</malay> the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> so sometimes <malay>bila dia tak mampu</malay> to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first <malay>apa</malay> because the mother is the priority first <malay>apa</malay>
so you know at times <malay>kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa</malay> (err) <malay>dia pun</malay> sometimes will say you know like (err)
<malay>puas hati masukkan</malay> (err) dalam <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit</malay>
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but <malay>dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia</malay> so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already [ah] and then the mother the mother say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) she try to not enter the room [ah] because she will feel extra sensitive because (err) her her parents (err) no my friend's mum is around like seventy plus
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like <malay>macam golongan</malay> really <malay>yang orang tua</malay> [lah]
so sometimes <malay>bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> react with <malay>aku dah macam</malay> !huh! <malay>macam mana nak</malay> what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>cik sabar</malay> [lah] <malay>cik cik tahan</malay> [jer] [lah]
but even the the mum also say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the mum somehow I can feel like the mum <malay>macam</malay> somehow appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam akan cakap apa</malay> like what you tell me like (err)
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum <malay>macam</malay>
the mum really appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [ah] the mum <malay>macam</malay> sometimes I think the mum <malay>dia tersentuh</malay> [lah] and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything <malay>sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon</malay> [ah] <malay>tak silap</malay>
because they <malay>dia dia orang orang boyan</malay> I think <malay>boyan ke jawa</malay> I think (err) <malay>jawa jawa</malay> sorry <malay>dia orang orang jawa</malay>
the parents are <malay>orang jawa</malay> so so so <malay>nasi rawon</malay> is like a big thing [lah] so I didn't come on the day she <malay>masak</malay> cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku tak dapat datang</malay> [ah] <malay>tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat</malay>
so the then the mum said [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cik masak</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu tapi tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang</malay> I'm like sorry [lah] <malay>cik</malay> K I mean
honestly <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>nak balik</malay> [kan] in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
(uh) <malay>dia</malay> automatically <malay>dia akan sedih</malay> so <malay>aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak</malay> react then he he say to me [lah] like !hey! can you do <malay>macam</malay> online from here then I'm like !huh! how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me <malay>macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia</malay>
but half of me I tell myself no I cannot I need to do something from us I mean I need to push through my studies ultimately that is my goal you know
I mean after so many years of just <malay>macam</malay> you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now <malay>macam</malay> you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time <malay>macam kita</malay> have that conversation with beberly [kan]

ya it's true you know actually when you think about it [lah] like you you you
you you you are always constantly searching for for your soul you know something like searching (err) consider searching for something you want in your life
so so that's why I was like telling myself (err) when when comes to to my friend [lah] ya <malay>aku tak boleh tolong dia</malay> all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to <malay>ulang balik</malay> come back because of the whole swab test (err) quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day <malay>dia dia pun nak kena redha</malay> and I <malay>aku pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(um) you don't worry because you you ask somebody
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just <malay>macam</malay>
he always <malay>dia dia selalu ingat yang</malay>
<malay>yang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia</malay>
then <malay>aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya</malay> cousin <malay>setakat</malay> cousin <malay>aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa</malay>
<malay>tapi dia dia macam tak</malay> [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> (err) then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> cousin <malay>aku tak</malay> take initiative and everything

I don't want to accept the money [lah] you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because (um) <malay>dia dah ada ni</malay> [ah] you know sometimes <malay>orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat</malay> [kan]

yup you don't apply in real life situation
that's true actually it's actually quite what I mean the whole thing is quite true you know when it comes to our education system
but <malay>untuk</malay> I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
nothing has changed [eh] over the past how many years we've been living in singapore it is still the same concept of education and everything
it's like you know like the survival of the fittest [lah]
(err) the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> study hard apostrophe
will progress <malay>kuat juga</malay> then the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak</malay> progress are the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> mediocre
will just fought out in society <malay>aku masih ingat</malay> (err) I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher (err) he
ya ya he say (err) work hard or work in mcdonald's
[ah] now when I think about him [ah] when I think about that statement [ah] about what he made at last time [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh] you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad [ah] you you are that [ah] that
<malay>macam</malay> his statement [ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> sense of <malay>macam</malay> elitism you know <malay>macam macam macam</malay> how our (err) government [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> that kind of it's like the vibe right there the <malay>dia kasih</malay> ya
<malay>macam</malay> very similar to how the government <malay>macam</malay> how the government is like [lah] so <malay>aku fikir</malay> [eh] you mean <malay>apa yang</malay> people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful <malay>padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini</malay> they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> content with what they have so
<malay>betul betul betul</malay>
understood understood understood
[ah]
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay (err) honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's [ah] we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly (um)
K initially (err) this is like my third (err) application to you know [ah] sorry should I should not mention the name [lah]
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so (um) so before I went there in my head I always thought <malay>macam</malay> able to [kan] <malay>aku nak belajar kat sana</malay> then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive [lah] in the beginning [lah] or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore [kan] <malay>pakai</malay> cambridge [kan] and <malay>sana</malay> they have their own system [tau] [ah] for <malay>apa tu macam</malay> for how to grade and grading and everything
and then <malay>kat sana aku perasan</malay> !wah! the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart [eh] we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know <malay>macam</malay> ones from #sabah# with the ones from #johor#
the ones from #perak# like <malay>aku dah aku</malay> I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but <malay>aku</malay> realize about them is what they lack is
(um)
they are they are very (err) examination based <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is <malay>macam</malay> hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is <malay>macam</malay> (err) the examination is (err) it's it's it's it's very straightforward [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like (err) those <malay>yang macam</malay> (err) critical thinker
is <malay>tak banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>kat sana</malay>
the ones <malay>yang</malay> critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones <malay>yang</malay> from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question <malay>yang macam</malay> critic <malay>yang macam</malay> higher thinking [ah]
but because our our education system is <malay>dah macam</malay> nurture us like this [kan] but <malay>bila</malay> when we go there <malay>dia orang</malay> think <malay>yang kita ni</malay> super on [tau]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> !huh! super on [eh] not really [leh] it's just that (uh) our just that our culture <malay>macam</malay> singapore culture has trained us to be like this <malay>macam</malay> and then some more you have to understand <malay>aku kat sana aku</malay> pay <malay>enam ribu</malay> [eh]
almost to like a nine K [eh] (err) nine K of (err) school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
so every hour and every minute <malay>tu bagi aku</malay> is <malay>duit</malay> so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like <malay>macam</malay> when [ah] so sometimes they they the malaysian <malay>kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> they are quite intimidated [lah] even my classmate also told me [ah] <malay>yang</malay> the very first time they met me they she feels that I am <malay>aku sombong aku</malay> arrogant <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] serious [ah]
she say [ah] <malay>engkau macam poyo</malay> [ah] <malay>aku dah</malay> serious [ah] <malay>poyo</malay>
[ah] <malay>poyo</malay> then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with <malay>aku</malay> I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my <malay>kepala</malay> would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior [lah] because you are overseas [mah] you're like you need to hustle <malay>apa</malay> and then then
when it comes to studies wise (err)
#alhamdulillah# I would say that I am coping very well [lah] I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that <malay>aku</malay> drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second (um)
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself (err) then I was not really focused [ah] like I still remember like the day before the exam <malay>baru aku nak belajar</malay> can you imagine
but I I had a very long months of preparing but but because of (err) I was like I don't know it's I just I just got so complacent in my head
ya <malay>yang</malay> answer script
[ah]
[ah] it's like a <malay>macam</malay> (err) I based (err) meaning [ah] I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same [ah] like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me [lah] [ah] who has studied in
so and then I saw in (err) semester three I told myself no I cannot
(um) [ah] in semester three I was very low key <malay>nak mampus</malay> [tau] <malay>aku macam aku</malay> every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet (uh) I even like (um) <malay>tak</malay> post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key [ah]
and then my my results was #alhamdulillah# I mean I I was quite surprised [ah] that I got three point nine which is the highest I have ever gotten [lah]
ya and then this coming semester four <malay>pun</malay> (err) <malay>aku</malay> hopefully [lah] I can get a (err) very good [lah] but all in all <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> I mean
I don't know I don't know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> but but you see [ah] I I remember that time [ah] <malay>aku baru balik dari</malay> #kedah# [tau] <malay>nak balik</malay> (err) <malay>pergi</malay> <malay>tak silap</malay> <malay>ke</malay> singapore (uh)
and then (err) I remember sitting with this (err) with this lady [lah] she is (err) from #penang# you know she no no I I I went #penang# sorry ya I went #penang# and then I was on my way back from #penang# to singapore via flight so there was this (err) lady that I I sat beside and then (err)
when I because I was sitting at the window seat right so when I say (err) excuse me (err) then (err) then so when I enter (err) and sit and when I seated here now
you know she automatically she ask me [eh] you singaporean [ah]
then <malay>aku dah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana kau tahu</malay> then she say [oh] I know [lah] because of your accent and the way you talk
<malay>aku dah</malay> !wow! I'm shocked man

<malay>merepek</malay> [sia]
what time you <malay>balik</malay>

[ah]
ya okay [lah] that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like <malay>turun</malay>
hand over shift
<malay>tujuh setengah</malay> [kan]
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I <malay>malas</malay> so I <malay>tidur</malay> I <malay>tidur</malay> in like the they have like a mass hall but <malay>atas</malay> [ah] on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else <malay>tidur</malay> on the first floor and then I <malay>tidur</malay> on the second floor
<malay>habis naik atas</malay> like <malay>pukul satu pagi</malay> then I was like [eh] ma'am I I go sleep first [ah] then she like [oh] K K I see you upstairs
<malay>habis tidur</malay>

then after that <malay>nak kena</malay> sign out [kan] the reservist <malay>nya</malay> attendance sheet
<malay>habis dia nya</malay>
night shift <malay>nya semua</malay> paramedics [dah] <malay>balik</malay> then I was like [eh] <malay>encik macam mana</malay> [sia] then he's like [ah] never mind I sign for you I sign for you
reservist
<malay>takkan nak begitu</malay> [sia] [lah]
<malay>balik</malay> on the dot [sia]
actually not really [lah] I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
(mm)
(mm)
night shift I wasn't like that [ah] because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning [kan]
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning [kan]
<malay>dulu</malay>
[orh] me and my friends <malay>selalu keluar</malay> eat breakfast [lah] so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics <malay>balik</malay> station [ah]
ya
last time my rota quite bonded [ah]
one time we <malay>naik basikal</malay>
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already <malay>pergi entah mana nak makan</malay> [lah] or something then my friend <malay>kata</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>aku tertinggal aku ni barang</malay> [ah]
then after that we cycled back and then we <malay>masuk</malay> the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>habis dia orang keluar</malay> then after that the #suay suay# the is like !oi! bicycle <malay>siapa ni</malay> then I was like <malay>encik encik bukan saya punya</malay> bicycle
[ah] that's like fucking eight bicycle [sia]
eight bicycles like parked beside the <malay>siapa tak bingit</malay> [sia]
<malay>nasib baik dia orang tak kena</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya how was it cardiac arrest right
[ah]
cannot [sia]
(mm)
[dah] expect [ah]
(mm)
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
twenty percent a quarter of them [ah] <malay>dapat</malay> shock
[ah]
(mm) depends [ah] depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
<malay>kadang kadang</malay>
no most of the time if <malay>dapat</malay> shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
[oh]
so the pulse [dah] <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
no no when was the last time the patient like <malay>dia orang sampai dia</malay> [dah] [dah] gone [kan] so like how long before that did they last see him
[orh] like <malay>depan mata</malay> [ah]
[oh]
why [sia]
ya ya ya
<malay>kadang</malay> [eh] the
when I went back reservist the medic told me <malay>sekarang</malay> they make it compulsory [sia]
all medics
<malay>kena</malay> like you you have to have the my responder app
my time it was like optional
then after that <malay>sekarang dia orang</malay> enforce like you have to download
then after that if you <malay>dapat</malay> the notification <malay>kena pergi</malay> [ah] I mean if you <malay>tak nampak</malay> then #bo pian# [lah] but
they expect you to go
(mm)
[ah]
that's cool
<malay>apa dia orang dapat</malay>
<malay>apa lagi</malay> case (err) the community responder was
the this captain from
(err) division #yishun#
<malay>habis</malay> the this the this captain the the <malay>dia dulu macam</malay> medical officer
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
<malay>habis</malay> my my <malay>kawan nampak dia tengah belakang</malay> was like <malay>belakang selalu macam lepak lepak</malay> [ah]
then after that <malay>dia nampak</malay> the captain <malay>dia terus</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah]
my the the responder is captain [ah] then after that he told us <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> take charge of the scenes <malay>semua</malay> then I was like [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>uar uar</malay> [sia] <malay>aku</malay> give <malay>kau</malay> lesson <malay>engkau buat bodoh</malay> [jer] <malay>macam tu</malay>
so ya
[oh] ya my last
you know my (err) last duty
one of my last few duties [ah] like my (err) the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate [sia] resuscitate the patient <malay>dapat</malay> we gave like I think three or four shocks
[eh] no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
but the <malay>nyonya</malay> was quite <malay>tua</malay> already
then they but the I think it's because
the <malay>dia orang</malay> [dah] <malay>tolong</malay> this <malay>nyonya</malay> out of the toilet then she <malay>terus</malay> collapse so like right from the <malay>mata</malay> [ah] then they immediately call
[eh] usually cardiac arrest <malay>kalau pagi pagi</malay> [kan] it's usually a <malay>macam orang baru bangun baru bangun</malay> then they <malay>jumpa</malay> the body then it's like [dah] <malay>beberap jam</malay> [ah] so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you <malay>dapat</malay> cardiac arrest
<malay>tak boleh</malay> save [ah]
ya it's like
pretty much [lah] but most of the time we still try [ah] just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare [ah] unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing [lah]
and <malay>kena buat</malay> <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] that time <malay>apa lagi</malay>
(err) my last duty in like my last duty ever <malay>kena dapat</malay> call the this #ah pek# he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we <malay>sampai</malay> and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court [ah]
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor <malay>datang</malay> so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor <malay>buat</malay> you know like got a there's a pace [one] when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
to do that kind
ya
then doctor <malay>buat macam macam</malay> jackhammer [sia] don't know [what]
<malay>macam begitu</malay> then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>pukimak ini apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ini</malay> rabbit [pe] and then after that my paramedic my paramedic <malay>tengah jalan</malay>
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
[sia] [lah] <malay>dia buat apa</malay> [sia] then I was like <malay>betul</malay> in public K <malay>buat betul betul</malay>
the doctor the doctor <malay>buat</malay> <malay>sembarang</malay> then we after that we all like what the fuck [sia] the doctor you know
then he was like like
that's why like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay [what] actually last time medic
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew [kan] you will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
[ah]
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you <malay>kena letak</malay> the [lah] the set up the set <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> the adrenaline <malay>kasi</malay> the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you <malay>buat salah</malay> you <malay>kelam kabut</malay> you don't give it to the paramedic on time <malay>kena maki</malay>
so like everybody will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I <malay>penat</malay>
ya
(err) they started right after I
I know my <malay>encik</malay> was the one who came up with the vehicles [sia] there like that was his project
as in
ya that's true
I think ya <malay>tak salah</malay> I heard they got the thing for <malay>macam orang</malay> morbidly obese
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
cause the normal the normal alpha <malay>sekarang</malay> is fucking <malay>kecil</malay> [sia] like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
(mm) the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh muat</malay>
the new alpha is freaking <malay>sempit</malay> [sia] like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite <malay>sempit</malay> already
so I think like the
plus the <malay>dengan</malay> the stretcher [kan]
like you don't need to <malay>angkat</malay> the stretcher like you just <malay>picik</malay> the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves <malay>bodoh tak nak taruh</malay> in ambulance when we actually convey patients <malay>ke mana yang sedia</malay>
<malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
wait the the guy also a medic [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
[orh] firefighter
[orh] then turn out for
[orh]
ya
actually [ah] the my last cardiac arrest case like <malay>bila balik</malay> reservist <malay>ni</malay> we also turn out with and then after that I <malay>nampak</malay> [kan]
so far <malay>dia orang asyik suruh</malay> the boy <malay>yang buat</malay> then after that <malay>yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian</malay> [sia]
the firefighting [ah]
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like <malay>tak</malay>
like <malay>lepas tangan</malay> so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment [ah] like we put in the <malay>apa</malay> tubing <malay>semua</malay>
and then after that so like free up free our hands [lah] so the crew <malay>yang buat</malay>
and then after that like I <malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> anyone wearing orange bunker gear <malay>buat</malay> so far is <malay>selalu</malay> the firefighter
like the the green the green one
[ah] [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah]
T shirt [sia]
what you all turn out <malay>pakai</malay> bunker gear [pe]
[ah] [ah] ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what I saw also [ah] when I turn out with them
but fun right
<malay>tak</malay> stress [ah]
(mm)
[eh] wait so were you were you the covering sec com
[oh] then <malay>nasib baik</malay> [sia] <malay>nasib baik ada</malay> the fire fight
[orh] so even then like if even if you turn out the will take charge [lah]
[ah] so so if anything like the will take charge of the call [lah]
what
[ah] ya
<malay>sekarang</malay> it's that's damn short [sia] so <malay>dulu dulu</malay> during my time [kan] the attachment was like two <malay>dua tiga tahun begitu</malay>
[oh] then
[ah] I see I see
ya
[orh] they want to put people into the
[ah]
[eh] but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is [ah] high intensity
ya let me google [ah] high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance to resuscitate a patient
so like basically the whole and then <malay>semua turun</malay> then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is [ah] like I'm sure there's like some
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
<malay>apa</malay>
make it better
I I also don't know
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people <malay>buat</malay> the medical staff [lah] the <malay>semua</malay>
that kind of thing but ya
I heard they was like they were starting to do it
quite often relatively often
but then <malay>sejak</malay> COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> fire site
serious
(mm)
then you #suay# [ah]
[eh] but #ons#
I get [lah] if you want to be #ons# but <malay>tapi ko nak kacau</malay> reservists <malay>buat apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>baru juga</malay> [ah]
[oh]
#sian# hopefully your next cycle gets better
double meaning <malay>tu apa</malay> [sia]
what the fuck
so it's basically covering the <malay>punya</malay>
workload and the
(uh huh)
[oh] so if turn out then you <malay>ikut</malay> if turn out also you <malay>ikut</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>rabak</malay>
if and turn out at the same time then how
[orh] okay
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>rabak</malay> [pe]
<malay>penat</malay> [ah]
it's like you turning out for two appliances
(mm)
and
<malay>mana siap</malay> [lah] at least you <malay>dapat</malay>
last time <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan] your <malay>tak ada</malay> you get to face
face something new
ya fun right
(mm) you you've seen how it works already [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
I I guess I get what you mean [ah] but it's been a long time since I felt that [ah]
[ah] like I never
[a'ah] <malay>mampus</malay> I I [loh]
last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download
then after that I think it was during like our talk or something like that
then <malay>macam kawan pekik</malay>
sir I off duty for what want to go collapse then we were like [sia] [lah] I mean I know everyone was thinking it [ah] but you don't have to say it bro
the officer just <malay>bawa</malay> [lah] then he just continue
ya
(mm)
ya you download already [ah]
the my responder app
!huh! [oh] you need the cert [ah] to download
ya <malay>tak</malay> probably [ah]
that's why I was supposed to get the cert
after my last refresher course
it's like every cycle they tell me [ah]
that [oh] you take this course you finish this refresher course we will give you your
certification
then it's like it only last two years
but I already do two cycles <malay>tak pernah dapat</malay> [sia] the card <malay>terlupa</malay>

to say that we are actually certified
ya
then <malay>tak pernah</malay> they never give
(err)
the no [lah] it's not like we go through the full <malay>benda</malay> [lah] cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
the only thing
is like we get tested on it like the contract indications and what not
and then they have the mannequin <malay>habis kena buat</malay> [lah] then they measure
like our our depth of compression the rate of compression that kind of thing
then if you pass then you will get by right supposed to get the cert [ah]
ya
I think it's just paper work [ah] so they like when you <malay>balik</malay> reservist then they said like [oh] we all got the cert already so we can turn out for cardiac arrest
but they never give us the card [ah]

(mm) <malay>pada pendapat saya</malay>
currently I haven't get my letter [lah] but
(um)
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> I want a fit body because (err) I <malay>suka main bola</malay> (err) football [kan]
so (err) <malay>kalau</malay> I'm more fit I can you know run faster (err) I can play better I can improve my performance [ah] in game
(err)
[kan] you <malay>tahu</malay> I <malay>main untuk</malay> (err) <malay>kelab bola</malay>
(err) <malay>dan</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
(err) I <malay>juga suka pergi</malay> gym I like
<malay>bila</malay> I go to gym I
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me [lah] over good looks but
of course <malay>kadangkala</malay> like of course everyone wants to have good looks [lah] you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks [what] so (err) ya [lah] ya got pros and cons [lah] for both but
(err)
if I had to pick one then
(err) <malay>mungkin</malay> I pick the fit body [lah]
how about you
(mm) <malay>yang tu betul juga</malay> (err)
going by that thought process <malay>kalau gitu mungkin</malay> I <malay>pun nak</malay> [ah] good looks [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> [pe] good looks <malay>tu</malay> (err) <malay>semua</malay> genetics <malay>tapi</malay> fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get [lah] you know then
(err)
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body [lah] but for good looks (err) if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it [what] so it's all down to genetics
(err) <malay>tapi bila dah tua</malay> (err) <malay>semua tu</malay> good looks <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay>
(err)
<malay>kalau</malay> long term
<malay>aku rasa</malay> fit body <malay>lebih penting</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab untuk</malay> (err) general health and well-being [kan]
(err) to fit body
(err) hopefully [lah] can you know live a healthier life and (err) not have any like
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes <malay>ke apa</malay>
(err)
!wah! your question so deep
(err) <malay>kalau gitu</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> everyone (err) <malay>selalu cakap pasal</malay> (err) global warming <malay>ni</malay> global warming <malay>tu</malay> our climate change <malay>ke apa</malay> I mean you just look at our weather [lah] everyday also in the forecast also always wrong [one] they say rain won't rain will be so hot then <malay>kalau</malay> (err) <malay>hujan pun</malay>
can have sun sometimes then it's like <malay>macam air panas aje</malay>
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
so I feel like (err) humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors [lah] (err) <malay>mungkin</malay> like slowly over time when the sea levels rise <malay>ke</malay> then all the you know <malay>kampung</malay> by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like <malay>mungkin</malay> will have (err)
<malay>lebih banyak</malay> (err) natural disaster <malay>semua</malay>
tsunami <malay>ke gempa bumi ke</malay>
ya
so
<malay>ataupun kalau bukan itu</malay>
extinct <malay>mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada</malay> COVID [kan] <malay>tu</malay> virus
<malay>tu</malay> virus <malay>semua</malay> like
especially <malay>kalau tengok</malay> (err) <malay>kalau</malay> singapore okay [lah] <malay>sekarang itu</malay> case <malay>semua sudah</malay> fall a lot right
but if you look at other countries (um) a bit more difficult to control [lah] especially if the country is very big right and
<malay>mungkin dia orang punya</malay> culture <malay>semua berbeza</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
(err) maybe they are more how to say like social like
(err) <malay>mereka suka peluk semua</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
could be a reason [lah] if let's say like scientists (err) cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
<malay>ini dua faktor</malay> [lah] <malay>yang mungkin akan</malay> [ah] <malay>menyebabkan</malay> (err) we as humans to go extinct [lah]
how about you what you think
you <malay>cakap pasal</malay> africa [kan] <malay>tadi aku ingat</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>kat sekolah</malay> we learn about econs right (err) they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then <malay>aku teringat</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> (err) (err) extreme hunger (err) <malay>yang</malay> disrupt <malay>disebabkan oleh</malay> poverty [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
I feel <malay>mungkin</malay> that's another reason [lah] there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like (err) humans slowly like the population reducing [lah] I'm not sure if you <malay>boleh sampai</malay> extinct <malay>semua tapi</malay>
(err) I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer <malay>yang miskin jadi lebih miskin</malay> then (um)
you know from all this (err)
hunger and starvation maybe like
(err) people will like the population will eventually get reduced [lah] cause
(err) all these (err) kind of (err) things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system <malay>tak kuat</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
(um)
if if this I mean don't know [lah] maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa [lah] of course other countries also you see the
the income inequality <malay>makin naik</malay> and the
ya [lah] so maybe the if the government don't do (um) anything to <malay>tolong</malay> [kan] the <malay>orang yang miskin orang yang</malay>
<malay>tak mampu</malay> then (um)
maybe [lah] this could be a factor that might contribute but <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>bukan</malay> main cause [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>menyebabkan</malay> (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) extinction of humans
(mm) ya ya
skill <malay>tu</malay> you like do you mean like (err)
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
[oh]
(mm) (err)
I mean
if that's the case right I mean maybe <malay>untuk saya</malay> [lah] (err)
I hope to be able to how to say <malay>macam</malay> like
<malay>boleh</malay> read people better [lah]
cause <malay>kalau gitu</malay> I can I <malay>boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu</malay> and I can like (um)
better like not say change myself [lah] but like (err) how to say like relate to them and like
(err) whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly [lah]
I (err) <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>bukan saja cara</malay> you <malay>cakap tapi</malay> (err)
<malay>mungkin</malay> (err) body language <malay>intonasi semua</malay> (err)
(err) ya [lah] <malay>itu</malay> like that's one of the first skill like I feel like (err) would be very beneficial [lah] and it's <malay>bukan satu</malay> skill <malay>yang senang untuk belajar pun</malay> it's like
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level [lah]
then maybe another skill would be like
(err)
<malay>lebih banyak</malay> confidence [ah] like especially (um)
<malay>dalam</malay> scenario <malay>macam</malay> public speaking <malay>depan</malay> (err) <malay>banyak orang</malay>
like the kind (err) it comes together with like
(um) like stage confidence [lah] not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people [lah] but like (err) <malay>buat</malay> (err) presentation <malay>ke</malay> (err) <malay>nak buat</malay> acting <malay>ke</malay> (err)
(err) performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like (um)
anything that has to do with like (err) maybe a high pressure situation or (err) like situations with like other consequence [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>pertandingan bola ke</malay> where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can <malay>dapat</malay> something [lah] you can win something at the end of the <malay>pertandingan</malay> [ah] so
like this kind of (err) situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say <malay>ada</malay> coach <malay>yang tengah</malay> scouting (err) player <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>baru yang</malay> young talent <malay>semua</malay>
(err) that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence [lah] I mean is (err) it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
(err) I feel like it's it's a very useful skill [lah] next time <malay>bila nak kerja semua kalau</malay> boss <malay>aku</malay> (err) <malay>suruh</malay> (err) <malay>buat</malay> presentation <malay>depan</malay> (err) colleagues <malay>aku semua</malay> then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation <malay>dia orang semua faham apa yang</malay> I <malay>nak cakap</malay>
(err) then
it's it's good [lah] in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
then (um) <malay>kalau</malay> the third skill maybe (err)
is more towards (um)
like being more optimistic (err) positive <malay>fikiran semua</malay> (err) mindset
<malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>aku nak yang</malay>
<malay>lebih ceria</malay> [lah] like I <malay>punya</malay> mood <malay>semua</malay> like
I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> any problem <malay>aku hadap</malay>
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset (err) <malay>kalau</malay> (err) as hard as it can be <malay>susah ke tak susah</malay> I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill <malay>ni penting</malay> cause it can help me to push through like let's say (um)
(err) gym <malay>kalau aku penat ke apa</malay> my next my next set I can just (err) keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
like
besides gym [lah] like (err) <malay>bola ke</malay> like next time <malay>nak kerja ke</malay> anything in life like I I feel like <malay>ni ni benda ni</malay> confidence <malay>dengan yang</malay> positive <malay>tu</malay> (err) <malay>sangat penting</malay> [lah] but <malay>ia bukan</malay> skill <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>senang untuk</malay> (err) cultivate <malay>ini</malay> skill (err) <malay>mesti</malay>
<malay>ambil</malay> time <malay>yang lama</malay> [lah] <malay>mesti</malay> build up over time <malay>tapi kalau sekarang</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>tiga-tiga</malay> skill <malay>ni</malay> !wah! <malay>paling</malay> best [ah]
[oh] third one <malay>macam</malay> like (err) it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
<malay>apa-apa pun boleh</malay> [lah]
!wah! <malay>kalau</malay> free <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau gitu</malay> overlap <malay>macam</malay> skill [kan] <malay>bukan saja benda</malay> physical
<malay>kalau gitu</malay>
(err)
<malay>sekarang sekarang benda yang</malay> high value [kan] <malay>yang kita kena bayar banyak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
(err) let's say (err) gold <malay>ke</malay> or stocks <malay>yang</malay> property <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> free [kan]
free <malay>untuk kita sendiri ke</malay> free <malay>untuk semua orang</malay>
<malay>kita sendiri</malay>
<malay>kalau gitu</malay> stocks [lah] <malay>kerana kalau</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> stocks <malay>yang banyak</malay>
I <malay>boleh jual</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu</malay> I can just use it to spend on whatever I want [lah] whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich [what]
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just (err) accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said [lah] in the condition given is that
<malay>dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi</malay> the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla <malay>ni semua</malay>
(err) <malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) involve <malay>dengan benda</malay> <malay>teknologi</malay>
<malay>semua ni benda</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya</malay> stocks <malay>semua naik naik</malay> exponentially [lah]
so like
(err)
if I <malay>boleh dapat ni benda semua</malay> I I can just you know (err)
increase my wealth from there [lah] whenever the stock market go up I can just (err) sell it if not I just hold on to it [lah] until the value is a good time to sell [lah]
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich <malay>boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua</malay> you know I can I can whatever that is material I can <malay>dapat dengan wang</malay> (err) I can I can have [lah]
ya
ya
for me [ah] probably
ability to teleport [lah]
<malay>kerana</malay>
like time is limited [lah] <malay>setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja</malay>
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time [lah] like
I <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tinggal di singapura ni</malay> singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
even then like
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> teleport you <malay>nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah</malay> you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
is is not a problem [lah] you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
just having that additional <malay>satu dua jam setiap hari</malay> I mean it could be even more for some people because
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
you can get more sleep your <malay>tidur</malay> is good you (err)
your health <malay>pun lebih baik</malay> (um)
you know you <malay>nak</malay> (err) like
<malay>ada orang</malay> [kan] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> (err) very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until <malay>dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga</malay>
<malay>tapi bila ada lebih masa ni</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> spend time <malay>dengan keluarga ke</malay> girlfriend <malay>ke apa</malay> you know your family time is a is a very (err) important thing but I feel like in today's world is (err) is lacking [lah] because (err) people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like <malay>selalu kalau</malay> (err) <malay>jalan sesak</malay> traffic jam or accident <malay>hujan ke</malay> then you waste even more time [lah] so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic [lah] but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself [lah] if other people also then you <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday over the weekend <malay>pun boleh apa</malay> (err) so
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower [lah] I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like (err) maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing [lah] that
(err) would would benefit like
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you [lah] cause you can teleport you yourself and then <malay>semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh</malay>
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
are you more of a marvel fan <malay>atau</malay> you <malay>lebih suka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>mungkin</malay>
<malay>untuk saya</malay>
(err)
<malay>mungkin</malay> hulk [lah] <malay>kerana</malay>
<malay>dia tu</malay> like
he's still a normal human being [lah] but <malay>bila dia marah</malay> then then only <malay>dia</malay> transform [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> like
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say [lah] with great power comes great responsibility [kan] so like
(um)
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation <malay>terhadap diri saya akan</malay> it will be very high [lah] from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
(um)
I feel like it's beneficial [lah] because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
<malay>tapi</malay> like as needed [lah] I can I can still possess
this (err) insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
<malay>kalau</malay> you
(mm)
I mean
<malay>untuk saya</malay> I feel like a lot of people like <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>banyak</malay> training like
(err) I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
like (err) <malay>semua orang selalu</malay> label me as like (err) buff strong whatever
but
especially <malay>dulu bila bila</malay> [eh] (err) start of this year right when I had the shoulder (err) shoulder surgery and all that
like
whenever I am injured [lah] like not just the shoulder surgery actually like <malay>dulu</malay> I <malay>pun ada</malay> ankle sprain <malay>ni semua</malay>
(err) whatever the case [lah] basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest (err) performance [lah]
I <malay>selalu</malay> (err) <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>hati tersinggung sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>kerana</malay> like
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
(um) be at the level that high level of fitness (um) because everyone (err) <malay>selalu tengok saya macam</malay>
they all look up to me as this (err) strong fit buff guy then
(um)
like <malay>bukan sahaja</malay> (uh) <malay>dari segi</malay> performance <malay>tapi</malay> like
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal</malay> (err)
<malay>badan saya</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
these so called good label can be (um)
<malay>boleh menjadi sesuatu yang</malay>
will come after you [lah] because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
as much as pressure <malay>tu tekanan tu</malay>
<malay>boleh tolong untuk</malay> (err) drive you motivate you <malay>tapi</malay> like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you <malay>memang</malay> your mood
is down [lah] like
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further [lah] you <malay>boleh</malay> cause <malay>itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam</malay> spiral
ya
so when you go into the spiral then (um)
<malay>dia mungkin</malay>
<malay>jadi susah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (um)
<malay>terukan aktiviti harian</malay> [lah] or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you <malay>nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun</malay> it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you <malay>memang bukan malas</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you <malay>nak</malay> just like
(err) just lay down in bed just like
<malay>dengar muzik ke apa</malay>
like
is it can become a real mood killer [lah] as much as like [oh] you think like (err) having this fit body like we said earlier [lah] <malay>tadi</malay> (um)
<malay>biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu</malay> label <malay>yang baik</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(um) this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look [ah] like good like physical look
all (err)
<malay>mungkin</malay> at times can be a bad label also [lah] I feel but
I feel like this is the <malay>paling paling</malay> common [lah] <malay>yang</malay> label <malay>yang semua kawan-kawan saya</malay>
they just (err) placed on me [lah] ya
okay [lah]
dream occupation <malay>saya</malay> is (err) to be a physiotherapist [kan] so
that's one but
also in five years six years time <malay>lepas</malay> uni depends on my situation [lah] if especially
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>masih</malay> single <malay>ke</malay> I [dah] attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
(um) of course devote some portion of day to the person [lah] like
like (err) <malay>bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
(err) partner
like
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person [lah] but okay (err) <malay>kalau kita</malay> assume <malay>tak ada orang tu</malay> I <malay>masih</malay> single I
<malay>masih tengah</malay> focus on my own goals
(err) <malay>lepas habis</malay> uni I'm probably be bonded to (err) one of the (err) government hospital [kan]
so
I mean
my work hours <malay>mungkin tak akan</malay> flexible <malay>sangat jadi</malay>
my my day will most likely be like
(err) going to work and all that then like
whatever free time <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>ada mungkin</malay> like
<malay>sekali seminggu</malay> [lah] I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like (um) like how to say like

<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>mungkin boleh</malay> represent <malay>negara ke apa</malay> (err) ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario <malay>untuk saya</malay> [lah] like
(err)
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>kerja pagi ke apa</malay> or <malay>mungkin</malay> I gym <malay>pagi</malay> (err) <malay>kerja sampai malam tengok</malay> [lah] then
but of course <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>dah ada</malay> (err) <malay>orang lain dalam</malay> in my life [lah] like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule [lah] but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe <malay>sekali seminggu</malay> just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship [lah] cause I feel like it's
very very important to you know (err) commit yourself to the other person
<malay>kasih dia</malay>
<malay>kasih</malay> you <malay>punya masa kena</malay> sacrifice <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk dia</malay> cause (um)
of course it will include cost [lah] but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person [lah] so that would be that would be ideal for me [lah] ya
[oh] ya <malay>cakap pasal itu</malay> I forgot one of my passions is also to
(err) <malay>kayuh basikal</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> like
ideally if if my my working hours <malay>pendek sikit</malay> (um)
I <malay>boleh</malay> slot in <malay>masa untuk</malay> (err) girlfriend <malay>masa untuk</malay> (err) gym <malay>tapi juga untuk</malay> (err) cycling [lah] and
<malay>paling</malay> best <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>ada satu kumpulan</malay> cycling <malay>macam</malay> like a cycling <malay>bukan</malay> maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group [lah] then
like every maybe <malay>bila tak panas</malay> [lah] maybe
early morning <malay>ke</malay> (err) <malay>lewat malam ke</malay> then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling [ah] road cycling <malay>bukan</malay> (err) trail riding
(err) ya then
I feel [lah] that would be ideal for me [lah] because it's something I really enjoy and it
(err)
<malay>dia memastikan yang</malay> I <malay>masih aktif</malay> [lah] <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dah tua nanti</malay>
<malay>kerana</malay> gym <malay>mungkin</malay> after some time like <malay>bila dah tua</malay> (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
you <malay>punya</malay> joints <malay>semua mungkin ada</malay> another problem [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> cycling
(err) <malay>dia punya</malay> risks <malay>tu rasa kurang sikit</malay> [lah]
ya
<malay>walaupun orang kata</malay>
you you ride a bike on the main road or <malay>jalan raya</malay> [kan]
but
I feel like (err) <malay>asalkan</malay> you it could (err) <malay>ikut peraturan jalan raya semua</malay> you follow the rules you just play safe [lah] you are you <malay>pakai</malay> lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group [lah] is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
(err) more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine [lah] ya anyway like
I <malay>bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa</malay> I just like for casual for enjoyment like
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) general health and well-being <malay>sahaja</malay> [lah] but
it's a fun way [lah] for me <malay>untuk untuk dapat</malay> [kan] (err)
<malay>kerana</malay> gym
like
your muscle will build up but
(err)
you <malay>punya</malay> cardiovascular health you <malay>punya jantung semua tu tak akan</malay> (um)
won't be trained as much [lah] <malay>tapi kalau nak buat</malay> cycling <malay>ke untuk</malay> you <malay>lari ke apa</malay> your

<malay>jadi</malay> (um)
(err) in the long run [lah] is <malay>aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin</malay>
(err) <malay>tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau</malay> ideal scenario I <malay>nak</malay> [lah] <malay>kerana</malay>
each ride will take about what <malay>dua jam</malay>
especially if it's like a a decently long ride [lah]
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause <malay>kalau</malay> gym <malay>empat puluh minit</malay> you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay [lah] but (err) <malay>kalau</malay> cycling you <malay>kena</malay> gear up <malay>semua</malay> you
<malay>jumpa kawan</malay> and then you go for your ride it it takes a while [lah] and <malay>mungkin</malay> along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some <malay>minum</malay> slight <malay>makan</malay> just snacks then
it takes time [lah] so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in (err)
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
(err) girlfriend [lah] ya

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
[oh] have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction [lah] television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
(uh) the other twin his ukrainian
(um) she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised (uh) she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress (uh) tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
(um) (uh) who is one of the clones [lah]
then she always (uh) live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming (uh) compared to season two and season four
(mm) I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones (uh) usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this [lah]
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember [lah] because this is the current show I'm watching now
(um)
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it [lah] so you won't get (err) you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil [lah] because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended (uh) without spoiling it for you
(err) I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes (uh) actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's (uh) probably safe to check out [ah] because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
foodpanda <malay>dah takde agaknya asal nak</malay>

[oh] I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's [ah] creepier and more real it's (um) it's not is not a comedy like orange orange [kan] orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent [ah] ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for (uh) (uh) why you like
[oh] (um) I mean for me (err) I'm waiting for money heist (uh) wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons [ah]
ya [ah] ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya (uh) my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show (uh) I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
[oh] ya
(mm)
ya ya
[oh] so you think you like a professional critic [ah]
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about (uh) about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident (uh) #raquel# losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real [lah] if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season (uh) but it was very entertaining to me [ah] also quite compelling and way better in spanish (um) ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
(uh) (uh) the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this (uh) money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions [ah] but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated [lah] anyway so today is twelve twelve (uh) sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full (uh) a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
(mm) I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at (uh) ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of (uh) sneakers on sale
(mm)

[ah] see how [lah] if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers <malay>ke</malay> or I will buy the cinema vouchers
no I'm busy (mm) I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding [ah] strider balance bike for #azam#
second
(uh) carousell so I found one (uh) (uh) that can deal at #buangkok# but (uh) he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
[oh] okay [lah] why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay [lah] firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand (uh) second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but (uh) the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly [lah]
it depends on his father's (uh) interests and free time
ya so have you thought about #azri's# suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
(uh) if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in (uh) government sector uniform group like (uh) prison service (uh) (um) I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive [eh] but you need to read more [lah] you need to do more research (uh) but there's bond [lah] I think (err) since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this (uh) uniform group then you should (uh) still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself [ah] that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
(uh) I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya (mm)
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
[oh] so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
(uh) their degree are sponsored by the company [ah] ya I mean like for example (um)
(mm)
so rolls royce pay for his degree
[oh] that's good so (uh) as he get as he [ah] got the degree right so did his salary also (uh) goes up went up
[oh] okay that's good can I ask what is his position
[oh] okay five years [eh] (mm) so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his (uh) recommendation do you don't you want to work there
[oh] okay okay
(mm) interesting rolls royce okay
[oh] so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him [lah] you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so !wah! when he joined what was his (uh) education (uh) certificate diploma so so he join (uh) it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant (uh) then he gets to stay there with his family
(mm) ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house [lah] well that's good that's good so so he so he's (uh) he told you that he signed bond for five years with (uh)
five years okay so (uh) is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree [oh] okay I think (uh) singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face [ah]
[oh] it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but [ah] but who will pay for this (uh) school the company or the company will reimburse
[oh] that's good
if you have to stay until the company
(mm) that means (err) work and study [ah] ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
[oh] really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good (um)
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so (err) for a wait
when when did when did I said (err) when (err) I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then (um)

okay
okay what degree you want
(mm) so what she working as now [oh] searching
almost a year so until now no job

okay so (err) found any new hobbies or you know like favourite activities ever since the COVID

(um) as for me (err)
well you know like previously if you I I mean I I prefer to go out and and such but now that kind so I feel that (err) I've learnt to you know last time I don't appreciate (um) netflix or watching movies but now I learn to
(um) you know adapt myself to try to watch netflix or you know play games and all these kind of new hobbies activities that makes me feel like maybe closer at home ya which is very
(err) depends because they now play like some (err) netflix original you know like all the chick flicks so I'm and then some of them are horror I'm into horror also so ya
something new for me ya
yes ya last time I feel like (err) it's such a waste I'm repaying every month <malay>untuk</malay> for netflix then <malay>sekarang macam</malay> it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya all the movies okay
ya
for this weekend okay (err) this weekend (err) probably you know like having lunch outside with my friends
ya or probably do some activities like (err) cycling you know ya probably I mean (err) tentative now the weather has you know [ah] you <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] [kan] weather <malay>dia sekarang nak hujan</malay>
<malay>hujan sekejap</malay> you know <malay>panas</malay> so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just (err) tentative plan
ya
how about yourself what are you going to do this weekend
[oh] cafe okay (err) do you (err) like any specific cafes that you love to go to
[oh] really <malay>dekat dekat</malay> town is it #bali# lane okay
okay
I should I should try [ah] I should <malay>pergi</malay> and you know <malay>mesti mesti</malay> weekends long queue [kan] and there's a lot of (um)
reserve
okay make reservations in advance okay so (um)
okay
[oh] it's been long time since I actually watched a movie in the cinema itself so (err) so do they do they do the social distance in the
for the seats
[oh] okay
<malay>jadi dia tak macam</malay> ya they block the seats [lah] okay
okay interesting
okay true <malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang ada</malay> movie <malay>apa yang</malay> best I mean <malay>dah lama juga tak</malay> check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online <malay>jadi</malay> (um) for us to go physically to the cinema <malay>macam</malay>
okay
so (um) ya
(mm) what
is one thing that (err) can I ask (err) what is one thing that (err) really will make you feel annoyed like you what do you
ya
cause you <malay>punya orang suka</malay> advance planning is it ya and also you <malay>kerja</malay> shift [kan] and also <malay>pasal</malay> your (um) off days
consider okay okay ya ya totally ya
I I I also prefer (um) cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when (um) someone make plans in advance so <malay>macam teratur sikit</malay> your you know your week for the week so ya
okay
(err) ya of course I prefer (err) advanced planning so I don't like it when (um) (err) for me that that is also one thing that annoys me ya
<malay>kalau orang buat</malay> advance planning (err)
<malay>kalau orang buat</malay> advance planning and then (err) you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially <malay>kalau kita</malay> plan big (um) occasions or (err) you know like (err) birthday parties or anything then <malay>lepas tu</malay> cancel it will be very hard you know
(err) but it's okay to me things happen I'll try to be more understanding ya but the real thing that will make me feel (um) annoyed is when
(err) actually someone lied to me you know like (um) behind my back it's just really annoying
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it (err) you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very <malay>marah</malay> you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest <malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> just you know admit things that you you don't like
so (um) ya
(err) that's one thing that will make me
really angry
ya
yes
ya
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like (err) because like maybe it's not a good thing <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>terlalu</malay> upfront <malay>atau terlalu</malay> honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you <malay>simpan</malay> or <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you <malay>marah</malay> and then you you keep things to yourself then
(uh) but you you still not happy about it so you you know <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that (um) you know there's no <malay>macam terasa hati</malay> that kind of thing
okay
ya <malay>lama kenal</malay> and then still keep in touch with (err) it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
grow a lot older now we just (err) communicate through (err)
instagram or social media ya because (err) most most of them are married with kids so <malay>macam</malay> they're busy <malay>dengan</malay> activity <malay>dia orang</malay> while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so <malay>nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah</malay> so now the best way is to communicate through social media
[ah] and then keep updates [lah] but then the the one that (err) I still (err) hang out with the most will be my secondary school friends also currently ya
how about yourself like are you still
okay
[oh] okay
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though (um) you know <malay>tak boleh jumpa</malay> and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact <malay>tanya khabar</malay> you know that's a very good thing
(mm)
ya
[oh] okay they are affected due to COVID
okay
ya good
(uh) ya <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>tahu</malay>
how how did you find out that (err) I'm into indo indie music
[oh] from my face my expression [oh] okay okay I didn't know that you can actually tell by (err) just looking at my
my personality and my face okay but good (err) ya good guess good guess ya you are right ya (um) I'm into indo like indie music ya currently that's (err)
(um) playing on my (err) playlist these few months ever since (err) COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music (um) <malay>suka</malay> (um) I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times <malay>kalau suka</malay> the same music then I'll just have the same
(um) over and over again especially during work working time or working hours or when I'm about to go to sleep that's the best time for me to listen to music ya ya
<malay>tengah hujan</malay> but I know that you are the opposite right you <malay>suka</malay> loud music [kan] you don't like <malay>macam</malay> cooling cooling
okay
for someone who's introvert then <malay>suka</malay> loud music ya
ya I can see that okay
emotional so you can express your feelings through music
ya okay ya true
actually
[orh] okay not that gore loud kind of thing [lah] okay okay
[oh] okay
okay
instrumental as in <malay>ada orang nyanyi ke</malay> is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
[orh] okay
[ah] <malay>tu itu kalau untuk tidur</malay> best [eh]

I I saw somewhere
small service
[oh] okay (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> what's that
[oh]
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
[ah]
so <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>dapat</malay> the idea of (um) starting up that (um) small business of yours
okay
(mm)
okay
so (err) <malay>berapa lama</malay> you [dah] you know venture into this small business
three months okay [oh] right
[oh] right okay
(mm)
(mm) okay okay
(mm)
ya <malay>betul</malay> true
so (um) now that (um) you [dah] venture this (err) for the trial <malay>semua</malay> for three months so (err) what are some of the obstacles that (err) you actually face throughout <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>susah</malay> that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
communication there's like barrier like language barrier
okay
okay
(mm) ya
the communications and liaise
I see
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you <malay>punya</malay> explanation <malay>tadi</malay> [kan] I think this is such a good (um) way you know to to start up like you know anyway you <malay>pun masih muda</malay> and then (err) I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you <malay>pun masih muda</malay> and then (err) I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you <malay>ada</malay> team <malay>lain macam</malay>
[oh] okay
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right <malay>dia orang pun kerja</malay>
(mm) okay
!wah! actually (uh) time management
okay I
(mm)
(mm) if you're if you are talking about business (um) ya there's a few things (err) on my mind <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>lama</malay> [lah] actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project (err) to help you know to actually (um)
kind of like support (um) like (err) you know small (err) other businesses that can help me to (err) create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me (err) to create (err) the leather sandals as per what I request <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>suka</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time (err) that this project is like the money will be going to (err) those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>tengah tengok</malay>
but then <malay>sebab sekarang tengah</malay> pandemic so I (um) (um) venture out and actually look at the quality and all to (um) the stuff
(err) I need to be <malay>kat sana</malay> physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] so I <malay>tak boleh</malay> I cannot (err)
you know like start (err) and plan is is kind of like difficult for me and to to to do a you know like trial
through (err) communication through (err) whatsapp <malay>pun</malay> it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you <malay>pun</malay> touch the material the quality ya so all these <malay>macam</malay> (err) I don't know like pandemic has (um) kind of like (err) stop (err) a lot of (um) my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know <malay>kita boleh</malay> travel and
ya
and you know (err) the economy <malay>pun kat</malay> other countries (err) affected [kan] like (err) because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support (um) you know when as we travel (um) like like for example malaysia <malay>kita semua pergi</malay> (err) to buy things ya all this now <malay>sekarang kita tak boleh</malay> we cannot go over
ya
yes ya
ya right
<malay>mahal</malay> ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you <malay>nak</malay> look at look out for your stuff <malay>tapi dah habis</malay> ya people tend to stock up a lot
ya and and
all this like <malay>macam</malay> kind of like (err) a bit difficult for us to travel around and (um) to look out for things that <malay>macam susah nak dapat</malay> you know nowadays cause everything (um) <malay>macam senang aje</malay> is very easy (err) to to sold out so you have to
(err) you know order online you know get it from other country purchase <malay>kat</malay> you know from other countries and (err) get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know (um) be stronger as (err) you know as a country as a as together
ya
yes ya so (uh) I mean twenty twenty [eh] to be honest has been such a tough (err) year for most of us like there's a lot of challenges but (um) this year is like (um) very interesting like something new for everyone so I'm just wondering about how next year
things will be like

<malay>kalau macam</malay> new zealand <malay>ke</malay> you know that kind of place <malay>orang selalu buat</malay> road trip [kan] you know like new zealand australia that kind of place <malay>orang selalu</malay> might <malay>sewa</malay> like (err) rent a caravan [kan] or
or do some road trip and (um) do some <malay>macam</malay> camping camping <malay>punya</malay> style [lah] [kan] compared to it's not a city vibes <malay>punya</malay> kind of
atmosphere so it it's nice you know ya can can consider for honeymoon
right
so it <malay>kalau macam gini</malay> you cannot (err) bring your parents [lah] [kan] do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
(mm)
okay
(mm)
[oh] okay so
correct
ya and also like <malay>macam</malay> accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
(um) places to <malay>macam</malay> (err) to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe (err) the elderly might not (err) (err) feel that (err) comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I <malay>tak rasa</malay> they might you know they will like it because it's (um) something new <malay>tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan</malay> they have their own preference [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> you notice
because I've experienced before <malay>macam</malay> (err) even though my mum is (um) she likes to travel <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan] she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like <malay>macam</malay> food [lah] she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like <malay>macam</malay> maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or <malay>macam sambal</malay> you know (err) her own comfort food [lah] <malay>dia</malay> still <malay>akan</malay> prefer that compared to <malay>macam</malay> to venture out and try all the different kinds of (err)
food from the country that we are heading to so <malay>dia tak akan</malay> really <malay>macam kalau makan pun sikit aje</malay>
just a bit so <malay>dia tak akan macam</malay> into it
so <malay>kalau</malay> for me myself when I travel I would love to
(err) I would love to (err) try out like the different kinds of
like (um) food but not I can see that my for my parents case they they are not open to try something new
our tastes ya
correct
ya
ya
ya correct that's why like they always pair (err) <malay>apa</malay> on standby they will bring (err) like <malay>sambal</malay> on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we (err) we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your (err) family or parents the the experience is different because maybe (uh) there's a lot of things that <malay>macam</malay>
might occur you know like (um) how the pace of how you want to travel the places you <malay>nak pergi</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you <malay>nak pergi tapi kalau dengan</malay> friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it it it's something (um) you know sometimes when I <malay>nak</malay> travel <malay>pun</malay> I will consider like should I bring my mum along or (um) okay [lah] <malay>tempat ni</malay> maybe I (err) just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not (um)
you know she might not like it and she'll object to the place like for example I want to
see the volcano (err) <malay>dekat</malay> indo something [kan] <malay>nak naik</malay> (err) the <malay>gunung</malay> but my mum say that [oh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like !hey! that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions (err) precautions and such <malay>tapi</malay> my mum will still think that <malay>tak boleh</malay> you know
ya so it's all
depends
correct
ya
ya true ya ya <malay>semua tanggung dengan</malay> parents
okay (um) I just love snow okay I <malay>suka</malay> winter even though
okay previously [kan] (err) I was studying overseas [kan] so (err) it was such a
good experience for me to (err) to finally <malay>dapat rasa</malay> you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and <malay>yang ke mana-mana yang ada</malay> snow
so <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> experience snow <malay>tu</malay> I was like a bit <malay>jakun</malay> [lah] then I was like a bit like !wow! snow and then (err) at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad <malay>sampai</malay> negative the temperature was really bad ya but (um)
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that (um) you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore <malay>panas pun panas</malay> but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in <malay>sejuk dia macam</malay> one kind ya
but (um) still I I <malay>suka</malay> snow because of I can <malay>main</malay> I can play with the snow and then (err) and then the the the season like the vibes (um)
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry (err) so <malay>dia macam</malay> the feeling <malay>dia</malay> to christmas <malay>lagi-lagi macam</malay> so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
still prefer to (um) to the winter season
how about you do you like autumn spring spring
ya ya it's it's like
[oh] okay
ya
autumn okay
cause like winter [kan] that's when the only time you <malay>boleh pakai</malay> thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers <malay>yang</malay> all the <malay>seluar kat</malay> singapore you <malay>tak boleh</malay> you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
what's the point of you wearing in singapore but that's the only time you get to (um)
look different ya but then (um) ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets <malay>semua</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is (err) pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these (um) jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I <malay>jual ke</malay> you know
or should I <malay>buang</malay> you know ya
ya
next few trips ya hopefully hopefully
I would really (err) want to I really <malay>nak</malay> one thing that I really <malay>nak pergi</malay> after this (err) one place sorry (err) would be japan ya
I've been trying to (err) but then I heard a lot of things like <malay>macam mahal juga</malay> [lah] their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe <malay>bila pergi</malay> japan you <malay>pernah pergi</malay> [kan]
[oh] okay
ya
korea <malay>dengan</malay> japan <malay>ada ada beza tak</malay> what do you think
(mm)
okay
[oh] ya
I think we singaporeans <malay>kena belajar</malay> [eh] from them basic manners
okay
I just want to try the train <malay>kalau</malay> to get to experience <malay>dekat</malay> japan you know like where the they have bullet train ya bullet train ya
have you tried
<malay>mahal</malay>
bullet train okay okay
I see
ya I I heard a lot about (err) <malay>pasal</malay> japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food (err) I mean (um) that japan has a lot of good food <malay>tapi macam</malay> when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit #tokyo# though like (um) ya <malay>macam</malay> #tokyo# is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
but ya
but it's okay (um)
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you <malay>dah pernah pergi</malay> (err) japan [kan]
so maybe you can bring me you can be my tour guide tour guide
okay
last time <malay>kita tak</malay> appreciate (err) <malay>buat</malay> travelling [kan] <malay>kita selalu</malay> (err) feel that okay anytime <malay>boleh pergi</malay> you know next time [lah] next year but then <malay>sekarang</malay> when it's really like <malay>macam</malay> stop us from travel
the feeling is like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] all these while especially <malay>kalau pasal gambar macam</malay> like let's say <malay>kita dah</malay> frequent <malay>pergi</malay> that country
[ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>ambil gambar</malay> [ah] <malay>tak payah pergi</malay> you know then all these memories <malay>macam</malay> [oh] no it's wasted <malay>macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar</malay> that kind of thing
but okay (um)
anything that you <malay>nak tanya</malay> I
(uh) does it feel does it feel like do you feel like it's like an interview
I think I'm too used to (err) having formal conversation so it sounds like an interview to you sorry
(err)
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like (err) small spider or <malay>semut</malay> sometimes I can be like you know
I I <malay>tak nak pegang</malay> I don't want to I don't want to kill it <malay>tak tak nak</malay> you know even though <malay>kita pakai</malay> tissue to throw it to <malay>angkat</malay> [kan] ya I'll be like <malay>tak nak</malay> you know just scared
<malay>cicak</malay> you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid [lah] because <malay>orang cakap</malay> like <malay>dah mati apa</malay> for example especially when it's dead [kan] then <malay>dah mati apa</malay> so like just just <malay>angkat</malay> [lah] but I still like no I got that fear and
secondly is the fear of height I I am not afraid to ride a roller coaster but then what makes me scared of it is like because it's quite high and then
(um) ya I just
ya I can still look through the window I still ya
because maybe because (um) <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>naik</malay> plane then [kan] <malay>ada</malay> clouds like covering so you <malay>tak nampak</malay> [tau] <malay>bawah sangat</malay>
and you are in a <malay>macam</malay> covered closed like you're inside the plane [what] so <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> exposed <malay>sangat</malay> you know to look down <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say it's a
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay> jump from a high a high building or something (err) you have to look down [kan] so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
okay
okay
(mm) ya
actually (err) when I was in hong-kong [kan] I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track (err) I was in hong-kong so (err) I <malay>naik</malay> this (err) cable car [tau] you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's (err) so you <malay>boleh nampak bawah</malay> your <malay>kaki</malay> can look through <malay>kat bawah</malay> so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared <malay>naik</malay> cable car <malay>biasa boleh apa</malay> but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
a new experience and I thought that I wouldn't be afraid or I won't like you know
(err) you know I won't be scared of it but apparently (uh) ya I was having a hard time so I didn't look down so I was like looking in front but
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to <malay>macam jatuh</malay> the feeling
so I guess ya even you <malay>naik</malay> luge [kan] you [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> open luge as in the <malay>apa yang</malay> the skyride <malay>tu yang</malay> <malay>dekat</malay> #sentosa#
[ah] ya correct that one <malay>itu pun macam</malay> open <malay>apa</malay> ya your legs dangling so <malay>macam</malay>
that one also I won't dare to <malay>macam ambil ambil</malay> video <malay>ambil gambar</malay> cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing <malay>macam</malay> is kind of critical [ah] I feel <malay>tapi orang cakap</malay> it's quite silly [lah] but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared <malay>tapi orang lain</malay> probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
but how about (um)
I mean for you I mean what is your what do you fear actually
really you look you look like so manly
really
(mm)
a bee stung [ah]
[oh] okay
[ah] okay
sponge then you touch it is it
then
[oh]
did you shout
can you can you try to (err) you know like reenact I would love to see your expression
[oh] okay
[oh] so where where did the spider <malay>tu apa lari</malay> then <malay>pergi</malay> somewhere like left or you had to kill it you <malay>kena bunuh</malay>
went away ya
actually is is that the spider <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>tahu kaki dia</malay> like <malay>tipis ke ke dia</malay>
I I don't know the the name of the spider
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ada kaki yang</malay> spider <malay>yang tipis ada yang</malay> very
hairy next so what kind of
ya ya ya [oh] no
I'm so glad like <malay>macam kalau</malay> singapore <malay>tak</malay> you you know <malay>tak macam sangat</malay> [lah] you know <malay>masuk</malay> spider but then if you are in <malay>kalau macam</malay> summer (um) season that's when the spiders (um) start to appear in in your house
so they start to <malay>masuk</malay> because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
(mm)
ya
so (um)
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say for example I <malay>suruh</malay> you (err) go and pick up a cockroach <malay>yang dah mati</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] just use your bare hands <malay>angkat macam gitu</malay>
ya
just like that <malay>angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh</malay> you know just
carry (err)
!ee! antenna okay I mean you <malay>boleh angkat macam gitu</malay> with your bare hands [oh] no
okay okay
okay
speaking of insects [kan] so (err) what do you think about <malay>orang-orang yang</malay> (err) actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like (err) is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you <malay>boleh ke makan</malay> cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
you tried
[oh]
!huh! in thailand
okay
(mmhmm)
cocoon
okay (mm)
because (err) some people always say that okay obviously (um) the
(err) obviously is like (um) the the the insects that is sold (um) for you to like can be consumed they say that it's (err) clean but you know it's clean (um)
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know <malay>macam</malay> it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know [lah] what where they found those kind of insect
but I still find disgusting even though like (um) they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to (um) to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
(err) you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
[orh]
ya
ya ya ya
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can <malay>macam</malay> at least the texture of the the <malay>dia punya</malay> shell <malay>macam</malay> edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
[oh] ya maybe probably ya but (um)
very interesting to see like (uh) maybe you you know (err) like like even when (um) when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
(err) is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a (um) they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them [kan] the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically (um) I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get (um) halal food because mostly (err) they eat like
pork is part of their you know <malay>macam</malay> culture they like to eat ya
yup okay
so I mean (err)
this is this is very interesting you know ya you know one thing that (um) I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have (err) been jumping a lot of topics but it actually (err)
you know connects us our conversation to to speak (err)
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we (um) when we we we talk is always on (err) whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can (err) do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
(um)
any any other questions that you want ask me
<malay>ada tak</malay>
because I know you are a very curious person [kan] so probably you might want to ask
[oh] so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it [oh] it isn't the latest [lah] the latest [kan] is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay (err) ya I mean (err) it's very expensive compared ya
ya right
but I know I can see that you are an android user you <malay>pakai</malay> samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about (um) samsung
front camera <malay>ke atau yang</malay> back the back camera
more to the back
ya
[oh] okay okay
but how about other android phones I mean android can be like samsung (um) (err) like (err) nokia you know all these
sony okay sony is (um)
<malay>dia punya</malay> music <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
the music (err) have good quality
camera okay I'm not quite updated I've been an iphone user
ya <malay>ada yang baru punya</malay> you know the the flip phone is it (err) samsung ya I I saw that it looks kind of cool you know you can just
flip your phone and then like very compact you <malay>boleh letak dalam</malay> bag you what do you think of that
the middle part <malay>tu</malay> [lah] the screen <malay>punya macam</malay>
okay
okay
that's that's (uh) that's good
[oh] ya I think (um) ya that's quite ya the downside of it [lah] I mean we we've been paying
quite a lot for iphone you know and then <malay>bila</malay> they they start to have like [ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> charger (err) you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok dia punya</malay>
<malay>bahagian</malay> at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old (err) ya the cable wire ya so it's like (um)
quite a hassle because usually the normal [kan] but then ya
ya ya correct correct so you <malay>nak beli</malay> the head <malay>tu</malay> you <malay>kena beli</malay> a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know (err) I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you (err) so <malay>kalau nanti</malay> free you just

B <malay>boleh percaya</malay>
shipping <malay>tak payah bayar</malay>

my side recording
five four three two one
okay <malay>baik</malay> okay let's start the things <malay>macam</malay> how's things on your weekend
ya I mean <malay>tadi</malay> ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid <malay>dia tidur</malay> all the way so my wife <malay>ingatkan dia</malay> can go to the hairdresser and then just relax <malay>kejap</malay> [lah]
you know just have a relaxing hair trim (err) hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that (err) because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before <malay>balik kerja</malay> [eh] <malay>jadi dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> one whole day just pamper <malay>sendiri saja</malay> [lah] so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this [ah] just nice also you (err) you also <malay>jadi</malay> to do all these things ya so K [lor] so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
(err) while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament <malay>punya benda</malay>
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these [leh] I don't think this (err) all the researchers I think it's okay [lah] to all these to talk about all these things [ah] I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
[a'ah]
exactly ya ya that's my idea <malay>pun</malay> I was also thinking about that actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya so ya I also (err) not been discussing my guys (err) all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with [lah] (err) those that were in the <malay>semua tu</malay>
so <malay>dia orang kata</malay> you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when <malay>kita takde benda</malay> you know like you you there's no real cove [lah]
like everybody knows <malay>kita punya</malay> reputation <malay>tapi takde takde</malay> portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event <malay>dulu</malay>
the weekly event and then just nice (err) earlier this week <malay>ada</malay> there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so <malay>dia punya</malay> format [eh] sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee <malay>jadi</malay> first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so <malay>kalau kalau</malay> all sixty four players <malay>masuk dalam</malay>
#prizenya# <malay>tak banyak</malay> it is seriously <malay>tak banyak</malay> actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person <malay>jadi</malay> the whole prize pool [eh] <malay>baru apa enam ratus</malay> six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get <malay>tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus</malay> dollar <malay>pun tak sampai</malay> it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league <malay>jadi kena main</malay> each other for like
(uh) (uh) god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks (err) assuming one game a week [lah]
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches <malay>jadi</malay> a a lot of the the response of the company <malay>semua tak nak main</malay> it's like [eh] it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars <malay>tapi</malay> you know like it's <malay>nak</malay> you you enter that
only top three <malay>dapat menang apa-apa</malay> and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even <malay>dua ratus</malay> so <malay>banyak orang</malay> you know the <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay> [lah] all this thing [ah] so I was wondering but
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
maybe let's say like of the registration fees [kan] ninety percent these guys only did like not even half [ah] what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent <malay>tak sampai setengah</malay> of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day <malay>saja</malay> and then (err) we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves (err) ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so (err) what's that called
(um) so serious because we are our own clients <malay>apa</malay>
so you know there's <malay>kita</malay> we can just like <malay>borak</malay> have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them [ah] look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars [ah] because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time <malay>saja</malay> [lah] so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per [ah] for the whole tournament [kan] then we take just ten percent that's (uh) between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour [lah] outside [lah] now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out [lah] but whatever it is at least [eh] the whole tournament (um) one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
I I I <malay>entah</malay> [eh] I also don't know how many people have resgistered <malay>tapi</malay> the the response I get <malay>banyak orang semua semua kutuk</malay> [ah] critics <malay>semua kutuk</malay> top top white center
now <malay>semua kata</malay> you know <malay>ni apa apa benda</malay> what kind of nonsense is this you know <malay>buat apa kita main buat apa</malay> I mean we play so much <malay>habis duit sikit saja</malay> then <malay>kena main lama lama</malay> how many weeks ya [lah] <malay>ada</malay> better things to do [ah] than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no <malay>tak tak tak nampak lain</malay> [ah] <malay>ada apa</malay> [eh] let me see <malay>kalau ada</malay> league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
(uh) I drop it in discord
ya so
<malay>namanya</malay> D to sports league <malay>entah siapa</malay> I <malay>langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada</malay> nine hundred plus members <malay>kat dalam</malay>
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
let's see <malay>ada tak berapa berapa orang dah</malay> sign up <malay>tak ni tak nampak pula</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi nampak macam masih buka</malay> [jer] <malay>masih boleh</malay> sign up [jer]
(um) I just didn't know
[a'ah] <malay>berapa orang</malay>
[ah] <malay>belum tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>berapa orang</malay> [ah] <malay>kat dalam</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this (err) whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so <malay>semua orang kata</malay> like
you know the this league not worth it seriously
so there wasn't even any one they say !alah! just go for the fun of <malay>biar</malay> [jer] <malay>langsung takde orang</malay> say that <malay>semua semua kutuk</malay> okay I'll I when I say <malay>semua</malay> [eh] it's literally there only like three people that response [ah] that responded
<malay>yang lain semua</malay> you know <malay>buat buat tak kisah saja</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
en
(mm)
ya
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>buat ni benda</malay> just (err) make a few posters <malay>bilang semua</malay> okay [eh] <malay>aku ada</malay> league [ah] you know you get thirty percent <malay>kalau kamu menang</malay> you get thirty percent
<malay>tapi</malay> fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything <malay>benda senang</malay> I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
<malay>macam</malay> gray <malay>macam makan makan makan sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>makan</malay> all the community
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah] exactly exactly ya
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point [lah] is that social media aspect [lah] so
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event <malay>semua</malay> [kan] minimum or I think we can do a (uh) forty a thirty forty players so <malay>takde</malay> issue <malay>langsung</malay> [ah]
but (um) the social media aspect of a one off thing [eh]
<malay>itu pun susah juga</malay> [kan] so I'm so I'm thinking at least <malay>kalau kita</malay> have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just (err) <malay>macam mana kata</malay> [eh]
(err)
every week <malay>ada</malay> content <malay>baru</malay> that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
[ah] ya
ya
[ah]
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and [ah] we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio [eh] how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm) maybe maybe who knows maybe
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
I
actually <malay>nak kata</malay> possible [eh]
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once [ah] actually <malay>nak kata</malay> registration fee <malay>selalunya berapa</malay>
<malay>sepuluh lima</malay>
<malay>selalunya</malay>
[ah] okay all the tournaments then
because they're by community centre budget no problem <malay>untuk dia punya wang</malay> actually it's free registration <malay>dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa</malay>
so it's just my <malay>masuk</malay> [lah] [kan] but that's for the <malay>punya</malay> [lah] (um) ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play <malay>juga</malay> then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> for all the events (um) what [ah] who [ah] they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>bayar bayar bayar</malay> [jer] so <malay>takde</malay> registration fee <malay>takpe juga untuk dia orang</malay> ya but for us we add in [lah] as much as we want to we are we are okay with
(uh) how do I say [ah] ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think !alamak! one day registration fee <malay>sepuluh ketul</malay> and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
you know so
ya so
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way (err) let's say registration fee let's say <malay>lima ketul</malay> [lah] I I can definitely okay
(err) five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know (err) so (err) or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that [ah] we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool [eh] wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off [tau] this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
(mm)
(mm)
ya correct
(uh huh)
<malay>betul</malay>
ya okay
(uh huh)
ya
(mm)
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say [eh] we do everything for every
let's say every saturday [lah] [eh] every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get (err) thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have (um) four four prize winners
each of the prize winners (err) okay and then at least (err) total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright (um)
or we could just put it every every week (err) the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number [lah] K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
the more people that join your prize <malay>pun naik gila babi</malay>
okay [a'ah] and then like this [ah] we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool [lah] basically [lah] alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say [eh] thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
(uh) one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match <malay>kau dah menang tiga</malay> dollar
ya
[ah] <malay>duit datang balik</malay> [tau] all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that [lah] so let me get up my word pad my notepad [ah] so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
[oh] six eight
[dah] eighty percent [eh] [a'ah] [sia] <malay>tu dah banyak juga tu</malay>
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually [ah] we can't do that maybe top eight [ah] top eight get five percent [lah]
yes
[ah]
ya get a wise five (uh) [eh]
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
soon <malay>lepas tu kalau dapat masuk</malay> to the semi final top four [ah]
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
(err) so five percent each <malay>lima peratus satu orang lima peratus</malay> okay <malay>naik</malay> top four
[ah] <malay>kau dapat sepuluh</malay> percent [lah] <malay>sepuluh peratus</malay> [ah]
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent [ah]
correct so you <malay>masuk kalau</malay> you <malay>masuk</malay> quarter final <malay>sudah dapat</malay> five percent you <malay>masuk</malay> semi final you get ten percent
you <malay>masuk</malay> final up to fifteen percent
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
(err) <malay>mana</malay> percent <malay>yang</malay>
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great [lah] okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh] so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four [eh] the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright <malay>naik</malay> four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool [dah] removed
K
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(um)
ya
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent <malay>pun boleh</malay> thirty percent of the total prize pool
[eh] of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is [lah] whatever amount
there will really get people to like [eh] !siala! if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at [eh] I only pay five dollar registration fee [tau] I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
[a'ah] correct
matchmaking <malay>pun susah</malay> [ah] [ah] ya so so that's the thing [ah] then the list (uh) ya uneven
so that's it we need to have at least
(um)
ya [eh] <malay>kalau tak</malay> some people get a buy then they get their money back [eh] that's not fair <malay>juga</malay> [eh]
(um)
okay but that's why okay you (um) then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
(mm) (mm)
(mm) true also true also difficult [ah]
(mm)
thirty two fairly I think [eh] no problem <malay>senang</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [ah] <malay>senang</malay>
sixty four possible
<malay>tapi aku tak boleh ganti</malay>
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
en
(mm)
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing [kan] I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off (um) so that hopefully we can get our own (uh) third party sponsors [ah] <malay>takde orang akan kacau kita</malay> [lah]
so this idea [eh] is basically if I were to go to N
falls the one that is working with SCOGA [ah] cause <malay>dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat</malay> community events <malay>sendiri juga</malay>
en
my understanding is that he has his own production <malay>punya</malay> house or something like that
(err) but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that [kan] we telling him that [eh] looked operations side <malay>kita semua dah</malay> settled everything <malay>kita dah dah fikir masak-masak</malay> and <malay>kita boleh</malay> you know <malay>bawa orang-orang</malay> confirm register <malay>punya</malay>
you know <malay>tapi</malay> the one problem [kan] that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA <malay>duit</malay> no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more (err) jet ideas
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them [kan] they're all out for it
that is what N #nadesan# has been saying [ah] <malay>kalau duit</malay> anything with money <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford <malay>kita</malay>
his words [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> so that's that's the thing [ah] we will be working you know like (uh) together with SCOGA it won't be our event [eh] technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
let me
[ah]
let me try and see if I can find (err)
(err) what's that called [lah]
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
<malay>semua</malay> ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway [lah] actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like [ah] people association <malay>entah apa</malay> community club [lah] sports club
south west <malay>ni semua</malay> so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this (err) <malay>apa dia</malay> E delta league
(err) basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
I don't know <malay>macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up [oh] okay so it's gonna be an offline event [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> venue partner [dah] sports up <malay>tapi</malay> it's (um) [ah] you know like (um) it's again [ah]
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations [ah]
so basically SCOGA [eh] in my opinion how they've been running all their events [kan] sama macam</malay> zenway <malay>sama</malay>
it's a it's a carbon copy
<malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>buat</malay> the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then (err) this (err) will have (err) the our
our venture <malay>punya</malay> logo whatever it is [lah] [eh] we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that (uh) ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
what I'm afraid of [eh] is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife [ah] technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event <malay>dia tak suka</malay> the idea of <malay>kita</malay> (um) how to say [ah] handing over the rains to another person
<malay>dia nak kita</malay> hundred percent <malay>seratus peratus ni</malay> event <malay>kita bukan orang lain punya</malay> this is ours have our name over there for and then of this (uh)
you know <malay>orang lain tak boleh kacau</malay> [ah] <malay>senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau</malay>
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about [lah] like
(err) like (um) even when I I told her the idea look [ah] why not (err) we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these [tau] she want us to be on our own
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner <malay>kita</malay> sure but it's not <malay>kita</malay> joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event [tau]
then they'll be like <malay>mana nama kau aku nampak nama</malay> SCOGA [jer] <malay>nama kau mana</malay>
I said [oh] now we work under SCOGA <malay>mana bukti</malay>
<malay>kita tak tahu</malay> SCOGA <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if <malay>kalau kita boleh tunjuk</malay> on a poster that has our logo on it
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african [lah]
<malay>dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa</malay> [ah] they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what [ah] (err) we are not not just mere partners or whatever <malay>kita tak buat apa-apa</malay> but
<malay>kita yang</malay> run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with [ah] whoever but they have to be partners it's not <malay>kita</malay> join <malay>dia orang</malay> we work under their name
that's the number one thing [ah]
yes
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor [lah]
a
[ah]
<malay>satu orang kena</malay> start <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] <malay>senang kata</malay>
[ah]
<malay>tu tu yang</malay> <malay>juga</malay> [eh] that
and then why I also <malay>tak nak</malay> like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> there there would seem a little bit of a chip [ah] then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor <malay>kata</malay> okay so <malay>siapa yang</malay> sponsor your previous event (uh) and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I <malay>tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>ini kau punya</malay> company <malay>apa</malay>
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible (um) you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all [lah] you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
(err) potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
(um)
ya ya correct
a
[ah] [ha] [ha] [ha] <malay>tu yang</malay> problem <malay>juga</malay>
(uh huh)
a
but I think I would okay <malay>nak kata</malay> our community [eh] okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like (um)
you will have your own you know shout out [lah] you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising [ah] a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events [eh] is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they (err) how to say that the
I <malay>macam mana nak kata</malay> (uh) <malay>ada orang kata</malay> a lot of times at people sponsor <malay>benda</malay> [kan] they don't actually get anything much out of it
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer [lah] in a way [lah]
it's the same as advertisement [ah] so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
(mm) but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head [eh] I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
junior <malay>apa</malay> junior what
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay (err) so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us [lah] okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
(mm)
yup (mm) (mm) (mm)
so
[ha] [ha]
[a'ah] [sia]
!alamak!
!alamak!
okay
okay
I think ya I think in the end <malay>tu nak buat</malay> sponsor tag [ah] in the end
ya
you know <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
okay
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now <malay>dekat</malay> facebook [eh] all the videos [kan] it will show how many views <malay>ada ada ada</malay> rather it will show how many views actually
[ah] what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>itu semua tak ada</malay> (um) ya even okay right now zenway is live right now <malay>sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok</malay> some mobile legends <malay>punya benda</malay>
ya but I don't see any total views <malay>belum lagi belum lagi</malay> total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show <malay>berapa</malay> [eh] let me see another video
(um)
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the problem my my midnight <malay>punya</malay> shows [ah]
there's another
[ah] correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports [lah]
one play E sports
one play sports videos the problem with <malay>semua malam-malam betul</malay> [ah] <malay>paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang</malay> #problemnya#
<malay>ada ada orang</malay> but it's not that much [ah] okay ya I'm looking here
(mm) asia champions league <malay>semalam</malay> nine hundred views (err) asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
pure (err) pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
(mm)
ya the singapore premier league a week ago (err) three point eight K views
one hour <malay>juga ni semua</malay> one our cast
(mm)
but that was the the very first <malay>punya</malay> [lah] I mean like it was the first
(err) what's that called
okay E #singa# cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
(err) E #singa# cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs [ah]
<malay>ramai juga</malay>
for the one V one E #singa# cup
one V one E #singa# cup
[oh] they split it into
the whole league
(err) but they split it into different parts [ah] <malay>macam</malay> part one first two hours ten ten K views
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands [ah] early thousands
you know so ya
quite quite a bit this four [lah] but then again [eh] E sports <malay>ada berapa berapa</malay> followers <malay>ni</malay> E sports how many followers
[oh] shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
[ah]
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel (err) you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
#aiman# will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask <malay>iman pun</malay> can we stream it on your stream
ya that would that would really help
because [eh] if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just (err) #aiman# giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then (err) what's that called [ah] ya and then like this [ah] people will be alerted
or even better if we can get we can rope #aiman# in as a commentator <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
ya
exactly
[ah] correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because [ah] I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that [lah] like how [sia] <malay>macam mana aku nak</malay> you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
[ah]
<malay>jadi kalau kalau</malay> if there's a way [eh] for us to go meet #aiman# I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think <malay>kalau kita bilang dia</malay> look <malay>kita ini kita semua</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> will <malay>ini kita punya</malay> event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money [ah] so maybe <malay>kalau dia dengar tu</malay> [eh] the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now <malay>dia ada banyak banyak</malay> event [kan]
<malay>jadi kalau kalau</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>dia banyak</malay> events [ah] so I don't know what he was bitching to us about [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> honestly I was like dude <malay>ini</malay> it like it [ah] I look I know you're disappointed E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia of fucking meeting [ah] (err) bullshit I just said [ah] sorry
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity [ah] you're winning quantity wise those two guys [eh] other than E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia <malay>apa lain dengan</malay> other <malay>dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay>
<malay>tak tak takde benda</malay> [sia] I can't I [ah]
okay I know that (err) see <malay>siapa ni</malay> matthew [eh] has (uh) has (uh) some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing <malay>dari bola</malay> [tau] so you know [ah] [oh] <malay>kalau nak kata</malay> streaming <malay>bola</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia orang takde benda</malay> [sia] decipher <malay>lagi takde benda</malay> at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher <malay>langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa</malay> [tau]
so ya so he said [oh] I lost out to them honestly [ah] it's just connections [ah] you lost [tau] on connections [ah] that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
a
ya
(um)
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
because I know he's been doing singapore events <malay>juga</malay>
you know and all we want [eh] it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our #chapalang# event <malay>tak ada</malay> sponsor <malay>takde apa takde benda</malay>
us <malay>sepuluh ribu</malay> views [tau]
or whatever we can (uh) we can get [lah] we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
[ah] ya so
(mm)
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who #sekaiichi# is [ah] they just look at pure viewership numbers [ah] we can talk about them [eh] we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
you know (err) ya I also can tell it you know [ah] definitely when I when I let know of my community (err) this this affinity whatsapp group <malay>semua</malay> that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
[ah]
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because (um) and you know really likes to work together with me [lah] basically [lah]
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA [lah] so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block <malay>kita ada</malay> [ah] <malay>aku aku pun tak tak takde</malay> ideas [ah] <malay>apa nak buat</malay> like to find my own third party sponsor <malay>semua takde</malay> idea <malay>langsung</malay> [ah]
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or (err) what [ah] <malay>macam macam kau dan aku yang yang</malay> my friend #hafiz# the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that [kan]
<malay>dia kerja</malay>
I broached either to him by [eh] <malay>nak</malay> sponsor <malay>kita tak</malay> you know this sort of event then <malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> managed to get them in [eh] <malay>aku bagi kau</malay> you know some some credit or whatever [lah] some kickback [lah] so <malay>dia kata</malay>
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage <malay>dia orang tak langsung tak</malay> support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
okay so
officially [eh] looking at their website [eh] <malay>dia kata</malay> [ah] they are a youth non profit organisation
<malay>kalau nak</malay> under official words [ah]
(um) ya they have (err) few initiatives [lah] all this (err) E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya (err) and they let see <malay>apa lagi dia orang ada</malay> [eh] about us
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
(uh) ya so <malay>apa ni</malay> executive committee
who do they have
nicholas aaron #khoo# <malay>macam</malay> familiar [jer] <malay>nama tu</malay>

(um) <malay>teknologi boleh menjadi</malay> (err) <malay>boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah</malay> (err) <malay>yang faedah dia</malay>
(um)
<malay>macam dalam pelajaran</malay> (uh) (um) <malay>cikgu boleh memberi</malay> assignment <malay>kepada murid-murid</malay> (um) (err) <malay>contohnya kalau ada</malay> E learning

<malay>murid</malay> (um) <malay>dari dari</malay> (um) <malay>muda mereka senang untuk</malay> catch up (um) their skills especially in technology
<malay>mereka senang untuk</malay> (uh) <malay>belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah</malay>
(uh)
<malay>dan mereka juga boleh</malay> (err) learn new skills from the internet because (um) but
<malay>banyak perkara yang baik dalam menggunakan teknologi jika digunakan dengan cara betul</malay>
(um)
<malay>yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini</malay> (err) <malay>ialah</malay> social media (um) <malay>mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan</malay>
(err) <malay>perkara yang di luar yang</malay> trend <malay>yang</malay> <malay>yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri</malay>

<malay>dan ingin dia yang ingin</malay>
<malay>ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya</malay> (um) <malay>tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya</malay>
(err) <malay>dengan itu saya rasa</malay> social media (err) technology <malay>haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin</malay>
[ah] <malay>untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna</malay> technology <malay>dengan baik mereka</malay> (uh) (uh) techonology <malay>ialah perkara</malay> (um) it's a safe platform for them

<malay>ia memudah untuk generasi muda sekarang</malay> (um) ya
[ah] ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
[oh] yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get (um)
second hand phone from you and <malay>ayah</malay> and
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad (err) cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it (um) ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
(uh) any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but (um)
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back (uh) just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it (um) even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but (um) maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me (err) excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not (um) just buy (err) knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya (err) just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that (um) which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work (um) then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes [ah] okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then (uh) you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say (err) when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss #johor# so much our old house ya but now it's (um) make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it [ah] #abu#
[oh] it's a terrace [oh] okay
yup because [ah] it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and (err) I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun [lah] ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase #abu#
sticky #sambal# I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's (uh) it's whatever happens (um)
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
well (um) where we go malaysia I really like us going trip at where is it <malay>adik</malay> (uh) wherever we travel malaysia is a a fun place but most of the time we went to #johor# (um) just for shopping you know going to giant
(um) because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper [what] I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger #ramly# burger #ramly# that I miss the most yup and the abalone
ya I know right it's so <malay>sedap</malay> I really miss malaysia food but too bad now is COVID nineteen we had to wait until (um) alright everything goes smoothly (um) but I really miss malaysia a lot it's amazing experience
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of (err) cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup (err) sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go #johor# and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that #abu#
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
(mm) I think so
(um) [ah] we went to cycling (um)
[ah] we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge (err) you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
[ah] and we tried (um) tried their [ah] that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it (uh) you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say #abu# like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
(um) yes because I was (um) for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
(um) I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
[oh] wait I can't (um)
[oh] actually I think I didn't went (um)
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or (uh) high elements in (um) school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay (um) my camp was at the #pulau ubin# there ya
(um) I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the (uh) I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore (um) ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to (um) rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
(um) you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
(um) I remember (um)
I can't (um) in secondary school we did a lot of things
(um) like (uh) like camps mostly camps
(err) give I remember (um) chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days (uh) and then what else [oh] (err) it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time (uh) in our secondary school (um) we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
(um) cause we had we change our principal I (um) our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they (uh) do (uh) about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
(um) ya
and all of them all of these charities (err) will be donated to the (uh) respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs [lah] for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that (uh) you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy (err) to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games [ah] and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you (err) I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
(uh) plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
(mm) ya and we have a lot of programmes [lah] actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme (um) like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed (um) how the way how they speak
we and their english [ah] the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that (um) I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup (err) from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them [lah] ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type [lah] actually (um) but [ah] for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you (err) like example for me (uh) I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
(err)
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like (um) ya (um)
it's like school also but no [ah] I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
(um)
sports there's a lot [ah] actually ya and yup [oh] to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves [lah] like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
(um) doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my (err) using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school (uh) we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs [lah] like you have to make (err) you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically (err) and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking (um)
because I I cause why I choose that course is (um) I I I want to learn how to (uh) bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
(um) pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun [lah] to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
[oh] (um) okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot (um) okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made (um) I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great (um)
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made (err) the pizza it (um) and we also make cakes (um) black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could (err) redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if [ah] even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like (uh) you have to cut it into threes (uh) three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and (err) after (err) the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling (err) at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
[oh] okay I remember (um) we didn't make okay (err) I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is #pate choux# in french and then you know (uh) we had to do eclaire #choux# so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like (uh) cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my (err) my class advisor though
(um) my sir showed us (uh) a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who (uh) they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed [lah] like they have really nice talents to (um) which I can also learn from them
ya
[oh] my lecturer name my (err) we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really (err) sir jeremy is a very nice (uh) teacher he
the (uh) he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our (uh) parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him (uh) he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who (err)
which teacher doesn't want to see their children (uh) their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like (err) like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
(um)
do you mean during COVID nineteen
(um) I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
(um) this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows (err) appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does (uh) when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause (uh) because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example [lah] like (um)
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross [lah]
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know (err) in restaurants last time was like (uh) you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the (um) the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like (um) (um)
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
(um) I know wearing a mask it will it will helps (um) to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face [lah] example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to (um) get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen (uh) to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like (um) it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
(um)
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like [oh] ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and [oh] and I was [oh] I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya (mm) but it's hard to breathe sometimes and [ah] ya
(mm) I don't know [lah] like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya
(um) so #abu# (um)
so how [ah] I heard that you went on on a holiday I mean you went on a staycation with your friend
how was it like how's the hotel how's the service and please (um) why not you share with us
(uh huh) (oo) okay
!wow! that's really fun I would like that too

[oh] okay okay
so do you recommend that (um) those who can't travel overseas and want their holiday wanting to have your holiday in singapore should have staycation in singapore
but ya but
ya because like (um) as me as a singaporean even though singapore is a small country I I don't really travel like to other places because I'm not I don't really like I'm not used to traveling to singapore a lot but I mean like you you know like discovering singapore
like you don't discover much about singapore but actually there are so there's a lot of interesting interesting things to do in singapore ya like I went to singapore flyer before
and then see the national day parade and
discovery centre science centre the esplanade olive twice ya remember #abu# you went (um) you went to perform your choir performance at the esplanade
I think you already did a amazing job and it was very adorable to see my own brother (um) you know doing choir you know ya how was your experience

[oh] pure geog
[oh] I see
what's the difference between normal geog and pure geog
it's like it's like it's like (err) O level it's like normal maths and O level maths
[oh] so
[oh] what do you okay so what do you I know okay tell me what you learned about geography or what can you tell about geography like what what what do you learn about geography
[oh] but [oh] you can understand what you learnt in geography
really
I see
yes
[oh] I see

okay I start
(err) my name #azmirul# I'm from singapore poly <malay>sekarang sekolah</malay>
year two marine engineering
you wanna talk about <malay>kita punya</malay> singapore poly life [lah] so far
how is it going
so for me and
<malay>aku rasa aku rasa</malay>
<malay>sekarang boleh</malay> manage [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like last time when I first entered <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>tak minat</malay> the course
so it was kind of <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk aku</malay>
how about you
okay
[oh] <malay>pasal dulu</malay> my first few choices was (uh) business business finance <malay>abeh aku minat</malay> tourism
so I put there only my first six choice [ah] then my marine engineering was <malay>aku nya tujuh ke lapan</malay> [ah]
I not sure but yes [ah] <malay>aku aku tak minat tapi</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> the <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kena taruk</malay> any course that I can put [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> along the way #alhamdulillah#
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay>
<malay>aku minat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku minat</malay> marine engineering <malay>nya</malay> module
and I'm doing quite okay in it [lah]
(mm)
doing okay
so <malay>kau apa sekarang</malay> [lah] like what are you doing in school what are your activities
[oh]
<malay>aku</malay> in <malay>dikir barat</malay> [ah] as you know
I I always tried to pull you in <malay>dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk</malay> so
now I really want to know the reason why <malay>kau tak nak masuk dikir barat</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
#muay thai# <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bukannya</malay> #muay thai# <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> stage fright <malay>ke</malay> like <malay>macam ada</malay> spectators <malay>tengok</malay>
is like to win [lah] is like to
is like not to impress the audience but to do it for yourself [lah]
right <malay>faham faham</malay> I understand
so actually our poly life quite stale
because <malay>sekarang pun</malay> COVID
then like <malay>kita lima hari</malay> five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
so really boring nowadays
so how's your secondary school life
introvert [ah]
studying
<malay>sama juga</malay> I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in secondary school especially in my
in my <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) younger days [ah] my sec one sec two <malay>menengah satu menengah dua</malay> that kind so I
<malay>banyak masalah dulu dengan cikgu</malay>
every month <malay>bapa kena</malay> call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise <malay>yang</malay>
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
so that's when <malay>aku sedar</malay> [lah] that I have to bulk up <malay>kalau tak memang aku takleh</malay> survive N or O levels
that's when N levels I did well
I did get twelve points [ah] <malay>takleh</malay>
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong [ah]
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject <malay>yang aku ambil</malay>
then <malay>aku</malay> end up in poly now
ya what is the most <malay>macam</malay>
what is the most naughty thing <malay>yang kau pernah buat</malay> secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most <malay>yang paling</malay>
[oh]
<malay>paling mahal</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
so <malay>kira</malay> [kan] self self nominate <malay>kau terus masuk</malay>
actually talking about <malay>yang</malay> student student council student leader and
<malay>dulu</malay> like what you said I was very naughty <malay>nakal gila</malay>
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
<malay>macam apa aku buat semua aku kena</malay> tone down <malay>pasal aku</malay> chairperson of the class and my school <malay>dorang ada selalu macam</malay> best chairperson
best leader best <malay>apa</malay> so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last [lah] basically <malay>macam</malay> in the rankings so <malay>macam</malay> sec three <malay>tu memang</malay> quite tough [lah] is like I'm still naughty
but end up <malay>nanti cikgu jalan</malay>
<malay>dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong</malay> [ah] I go <malay>angkat</malay>
teacher you need help [ah] then <malay>aku angkat aku angkat</malay> [kan] <malay>masuk</malay> staffroom
so <malay>kira</malay> like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so <malay>aku</malay> just suck it up [lah]
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head [lah] I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
and my teachers in sports leaders <malay>suka aku</malay>
<malay>pasal aku</malay> not the quiet type
but students leader <malay>punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku</malay> naughty <malay>sangat</malay> so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school [lah] <malay>tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada</malay> different opinion about the same person
ya
that's that's being naughty [lah] <malay>dekat sekolah</malay>
ya
[oh] <malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>kira tu</malay> naughty [ah] [kan]
<malay>tu bikin kau paling</malay> guilty [ah] [kan]
guilty <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
<malay>jadi cikgu tertipu</malay> [kan]
they love it too much [lah] they think you can they can
you can hold on to you [ah]
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
so <malay>macam dorang dah</malay> bless [ah]
so <malay>lepas</malay> O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time <malay>ke</malay>
burger king
(mm)
I basically after N levels
<malay>aku kerja yang kau tahu</malay> volunteer volunteer <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>yang nampak dekat</malay> (uh) fast jobs <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay> [oh] you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance [ah] <malay>kira</malay> that time too is big money for me know so <malay>kadang-kadang kalau ada</malay> shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
that was my basically <malay>aku nya</malay> work for my whole N level till when I go sec five [ah]
so <malay>aku akan kerja</malay> all the way
then basically nothing much [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan</malay> with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
I work there and it was a good experience [lah] it was a good two months
experience <malay>aku pernah</malay> [tau] <malay>sekali kerja</malay>
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
<malay>tiga hari</malay> [jer] off day <malay>aku nya gaji</malay> at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and <malay>satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> minus
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
so if anybody interested join staff <malay>masuk</malay> [lah] ya so
irony but I do have some problems [lah] I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually <malay>orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama</malay> age
don't have the same (uh) mentality as us
the same <malay>pemikiran</malay> [lah] basically so <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tahan</malay> for two months then <malay>aku</malay> just took adapt <malay>aku</malay> just try to adapt to the situation [lah] <malay>yang aku aku</malay> was in
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly <malay>baik gila</malay>
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities <malay>semua dorang kena beli</malay> then they have to keep at home
so it's a tough time [ah] for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
!wah! salute [ah] <malay>dorang</malay>
ya
after staff day nope
I don't <malay>dah</malay>
<malay>tak kerja</malay>
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's [what]
the group [mah]
(mm)
okay that was that was fast
like photographer [ah]
<malay>tolong orang ambil gambar</malay>
[oh]
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
[oh] is not always the <malay>sama</malay> part [lah]
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
like <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [eh]
as in <malay>aku prefer</malay> [tau] honestly <malay>aku</malay> would prefer a busy
a busy working environment <malay>pasal</malay> at least <malay>aku ada benda</malay> [tau] <malay>nak buat</malay> like something to do <malay>kalau</malay> they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
my opinion [ah]
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
<malay>macam benda ni semua</malay> I can see <malay>cikgu kita</malay> are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be <malay>macam</malay> very independent because in the future <malay>semua benda-benda</malay> engineering <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>dorang dah ajar</malay>
you apply yourself
they won't <malay>hari-hari tengok kau buat</malay>
they would expect you to know how to do and all
that's why <malay>macam</malay> I feel engineering early brush you [lah] and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop [ah]
<malay>macam betul-betul</malay> flop then <malay>susah</malay> once you know once <malay>dah jatuh</malay> in poly <malay>susah nak naik balik</malay>
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
<malay>aku masuk</malay> shore which is first first semester so right after this semester <malay>aku</malay> probably has a month's break then after that <malay>aku dah kena masuk</malay> intern [lah]
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
by <malay>dia punya</malay> sailing
<malay>aku nak belayar</malay> basically I just want to go
explore countries <malay>negara semua negara</malay> england <malay>semua</malay> whatever [lah]
(uh) <malay>yang ada</malay> ports <malay>semua</malay> [kan] saudi arabia <malay>ke</malay> whatever
so <malay>aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> sailing results must be very strong
because it's the top few [ah] from what I know [lah] from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
so <malay>aku</malay> legit work very hard
<malay>untuk aku</malay> year one year two <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>rezeki tak ada aku tak dapat</malay>
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
<malay>aku punya</malay> type is <malay>aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir</malay> [ah]
so I just follow the flow
so at the end of the day <malay>aku</malay> don't mind shore <malay>kalau dapat</malay> keppel okay [lor]
<malay>kira</malay> very good [orh] keppel
then ya [lah] I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
(mm)
ya <malay>betul</malay>
but ya [lah] you so you are willing [lah] <malay>kau kira</malay> willing <malay>untuk</malay> sail every year six months
to make it as your career
time <malay>kau balik pun dah penat</malay>
(mm)
correct agree
so your ultimate goal is to get <malay>macam</malay>
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore [lah]
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> you are not away from your family too long
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down [lah]
surveyor <malay>macam benda</malay> relax [ah]
ya
yup but honestly
okay [ah] during during circuit breaker and all we all <malay>semua</malay> stuck <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
<malay>pelik</malay> but yes <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> found a love from
karma medic [lah] <malay>nama</malay> youtube channel
and <malay>aku suka</malay> biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class <malay>duduk belakang dengar</malay>
that's how much I love bio last time
but ya the love come back and I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni <malay>ke apa</malay>
ya so talking about uni <malay>kita belum lagi lepas</malay>
so is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
<malay>wayang</malay> [ah]
annoying
<malay>kacau-kacau</malay>
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
(mm)
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun [lah] I mean
I I watch a lot of [ah] boys to men [ah] so I find the navy part the best [ah]
so [ah] the frogmen one <malay>tu yang paling gerek</malay> [ah]
so <malay>aku nak masuk</malay> navy <malay>tapi aku tahu</malay>
<malay>aku tahu tak</malay> probably <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [lah] <malay>masuk</malay> navy [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> chance will be slim
but yes [ah] so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>tak aku nak</malay> try my best to go police
<malay>kalau</malay> police <malay>pun</malay>
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
<malay>aku kena</malay> train <malay>banyak</malay> so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
got highly likely [lah]
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I pass my
then after that I hope I can go to [ah]
special operations command
<malay>kalau tak pun</malay> I don't mind
[eh] <malay>pula</malay> I don't mind civil defense
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and (uh)
[ah] firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life [hor]
<malay>tu pun pergi</malay> [tau] <malay>sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai</malay>
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first [leh]
my father never go so <malay>aku rasa</malay> I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always <malay>kena hijau</malay> from the trend [lah] that's what they say [lah] but no <malay>hijau</malay> for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring [lah] my opinion <malay>macam gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] ya okay [lah] <malay>tengok macam mana</malay>
will definitely be will definitely glow up [lah] after
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
<malay>tapi kalau aku dapat</malay> air force who wouldn't take it
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
!chey! !wah! <malay>pandai</malay> [seh] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] intelligence
I don't think got chance [ah]
intelligence
talk [eh]
four hours
quick maths [ah]
okay
<malay>susah dok</malay>
it was okay
what was your score though they never tell you <malay>tak bilang</malay>
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult <malay>ke apa</malay>
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma [lah] there's normally
consider
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>ke dah dah minat nak</malay> sign on
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
<malay>kena berapa bagus</malay> !wow!
<malay>ada</malay> size <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
okay
it's kinda cool though
(mm)
primary school
<malay>sekarang berapa</malay> years
<malay>masih</malay> [eh] <malay>masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun</malay> [jer] primary school
(mm)
is like our one of our longest [ah]
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be [ah]
<malay>bila</malay> primary school [kan] <malay>nanti</malay>
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
<malay>nanti kita tengok</malay> movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there <malay>kita semua dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> basically know the type of person you want to be like (err) like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>punya</malay> movie show [kan] was [ah]
wrestling
so I really look up to them [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I didn't realise [tau] <malay>yang itu semua watak</malay>
as in <malay>tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua</malay> just <malay>rekaan</malay> [tau] I didn't know
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> okay let's say <malay>macam dulu</malay> undertaker <malay>betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia jahat betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak nak nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>nak kasi orang sakit</malay>
so I like their character [ah]
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like <malay>macam</malay> undertaker
<malay>buat mata dia yang</malay> roll eyes back
so <malay>kira macam</malay> last time primary school was one of the best times because
<malay>kita</malay> explore [ah]
<malay>kita</malay> explore <malay>banyak benda</malay>
<malay>satu hari kita</malay> undertaker the next day we john cena the next day #yuka civi#
ya that was that was fun days [ah]
ya in primary school also <malay>dulu kita suka buat banyak</malay> parkour
do you do parkour in school it's like normal [lah] primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mm)
okay
[oh]
so you have been leading all the way [lah] you have been leading the lines [lah]
discipline
(mm)
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
#tekong# the left side is striker
[oh]
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
striker <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay>
<malay>bebas</malay> like horse kick right
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
<malay>sepak takraw</malay>
they were national team player [ah] after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
have you ever win the finals <malay>pernah menang</malay>
<malay>selalu kalah dengan siapa</malay>
who's your bogey team [ah] <malay>macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti</malay>
<malay>kalah punya</malay>
#junyuan# #tampines# located around #tampines# [kan]
#junyuan#
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus [lah]
pressure [lah]
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
<malay>sedih</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
you never go this far [lah]
!woo! amazing story
for me <malay>kalau bab-bab</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>atau</malay> activity [kan]
I don't really have much luck [lah]
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
I was goalkeeper you know you know when <malay>kau penjaga gawang</malay> in primary school
you will always be blamed
if the goals you concede so we basically second round <malay>kita dah keluar</malay> everytime
<malay>kita masuk</malay> south zone <malay>kita keluar kita</malay> group stages
then secondary school I was in so <malay>kau tahu</malay> <malay>ada banyak</malay>
[lah] <malay>yang joget-joget sambil</malay> marching
to our highest position that we ever got
in #gan eng seng# secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us (err) (err) the
the the drop dead centre [lah]
then when I go so basically no luck [lah] I go delta league also I play under my school name
(uh) and that [one] second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
[ah] make the police create the league <malay>untuk macam orang-orang tak</malay>
<malay>buat buat kerja nakal macam</malay>
<malay>dadah</malay>
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
<malay>untuk</malay> all the <malay>budak melayu</malay> not only <malay>budak melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>budak melayu budak cina</malay> there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
for a prize
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors <malay>semua masuk</malay>
<malay>tu pun</malay> second round <malay>kita</malay> out
then when I goes poly
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay>
I join <malay>dikir barat</malay> and my first ever performance
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me [lah] it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
so of course after the performance <malay>aku nangis</malay> [siol]
<malay>aku nangis</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really my heart was pouring [ah]
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
so that that was when my mood for <malay>dikir</malay> honestly
like
go down [ah]
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
<malay>aku kena aku kena</malay> step in to change
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
(um) this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
for <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they they appointed me as captain and
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents <malay>ragu-ragu</malay> [ah]
my parents will think [eh] <malay>macam mana aku nya anak nya</malay> results
<malay>sekolah pelajaran akan</malay> jeopardise <malay>ke tak</malay>
that kind of thing so <malay>aku pun macam</malay> second guess [ah] <malay>aku</malay> second guess but I love <malay>dikir barat</malay> so much
and I look at how rich our history
in <malay>dikir barat</malay> twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like <malay>macam nama</malay> engraved <malay>dekat dekat kau nya</malay> trophy I also never had the recognition of
<malay>pemenang dikir barat</malay> singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
it's a heavy responsibility <malay>tapi</malay> we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
<malay>macam</malay> teaching
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
your <malay>kawan takkan</malay> [eh] coach <malay>pasal</malay> they coach <malay>kau marah dia tapi kau</malay> as a <malay>kawan kau</malay> still <malay>tolong</malay> that kind of thing
ya so I guess
we have our ups and downs <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
<malay>kau</malay> cannot
you
you will not succeed
<malay>kalau kau</malay> always feel that you are at the bottom
you know
at least something know
<malay>dah kita dah</malay> improve at least be happy about it <malay>jangan cakap</malay> !yay! <malay>tak</malay> last
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
the change the journey [lah] how they get fourth how they get fourth don't celebrate the fourth because we are not there yet but celebrate how do we get there
that that that <malay>pada aku tu yang paling penting</malay> [ah] <malay>dalam</malay>
<malay>dalam</malay> inner change
because to see change you also have to change
you can't keep thinking of [eh] <malay>kita dulu</malay> last
we are everytime at the bottom we must think that some someday we can be as good as
we must be up there
you know
but ya [lah] it's all good now
then now hopefully in the future we can
do more things and improve further [lah]
ya so talking about how sweet you are to me
how's
like do you have any love life how's your love life
(mm) love life
as in <malay>berbual macam</malay> single <malay>ke</malay> attached <malay>ke</malay> seeing someone

he refuse to do it because he says is a holiday
no [lah] didn't sort
I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset [what] like last time also holiday is like finish up the
(um)
assessment book that kind but the thing is right (um)
was #ilya# <malay>ni bila</malay>
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like (um)
I see okay I ask her [lah] [oh] when you have one dollar then I start <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia dah</malay> then I say what is that
(uh)
[oh] like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like !hey! I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like !huh! maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
then <malay>baru dia</malay> like
okay okay and (uh)
that's usual [lah] cause #ilan# was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you [what]
timetable [kan]
I never teach her timetable [lah] I always subtraction <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> count backwards
<malay>dengan tu</malay>
like like she can even ask me like when I said
like <malay>apa</malay> (um)
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
[eh] (err) one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me (err) is it (err) minus or plus
you get I mean is like what do you do you buy something you still get more money [ah] or you lose money or you take away and she go [oh] <malay>duit</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> no I find <malay>dia tak</malay> grasp the concept <malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>dia cuma</malay> like [oh] I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent [ah]
ya ya ya that kind of thing
like #ilan# is some one <malay>senang nak tangkap sebab dia</malay>
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff [lah]
but for her <malay>dia punya</malay> ya the concept
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her [ah]
then I because I at the same time <malay>aku pun</malay> spring clean #ilan's# room I threw quite a lot like all those also gonna throw (err) except for that cotton on (uh) paper bag [ah] <malay>tu barang-barang</malay>
<malay>atas</malay>
is like
so much nonsense and so dirty and then [oh] finally <malay>aku tengok</malay> <malay>karangan</malay> and the composition [ah]
ya [lah] the one he didn't show us right so anyway when I read I read that
he
I felt that he wrote it slightly differently [lah] formally but
to me
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>cemerlang mana</malay> you know
even though the thing is like <malay>cemerlang</malay> for
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so
ya the english one I see not that good <malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak</malay>
he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay
introduction ya ya definitely but you cannot first paragraph [jer] good <malay>lepas tu</malay> lousy right
he just
punctuation marks I don't know why
I feel like he should there should be a writing camp you know like drill them to writing and then like learn a lesson
okay

not nice she already said to the one <malay>yang</malay>

that she wants to such told the rental agent
ya but
you know when
when the agent <malay>ada banyak</malay> contacts and <malay>banyak</malay> followers it's easier to sell [lah]
(mm)
what has changed
(mm)
the calculations whether it's better
yup
I don't know I don't know what is
[oh] really but when is it going to [ah]
no plans to move what do they expect to
then the only way is to rent [lah]
because they cannot you cannot buy in time [what] it's gonna be end of the year
I don't know man
ya did he mention like
ya another two more minutes
fast
okay <malay>macam mana besok</malay>
<malay>besok</malay> is
ya please please and
#ilya# first
just now when did (err) why did (uh) your friend calling me
(mm)
confidential stuff
confidential stuff
(mm)

[eh] #amshar# I'm doing good [lah] how how about you
you mean great and just
actually <malay>sekarang</malay> so far
what's up [ah] with you and your like the whole COVID situation how has it affected you
ya like your daily life [ah]
ya I mean to be honest so far my
life has been as per normal because now we all have
preoccupied with things that we need to do [lah] like like for example
I mean being in army like a lot of things already <malay>sudah</malay> restricted so
naturally we all <malay>sudah tak boleh keluar tak boleh</malay> go see our friends and all that so weekdays all <malay>aku pun tak</malay> free then
weekend is the only time I got time [lah] to go out and meet my friends then when we are outside also
got a lot of (err) measures that have been imposed [ah] that we need to
you know follow so that you know <malay>sekarang tak tak dapat saman</malay> [kan] ya
you [eh] what you notice anything different now
as compared to last time when there was no such measures
[oh] ya now is like the limit is wait is it still five or <malay>sekarang sudah buat sepuluh orang</malay> is it
actually if I'm not wrong now <malay>kalau</malay> wedding [kan] then we can have up to fifty people right
one hundred is it
hundred people [ah] now so but is that part of phase three or is it just phase two regulations
phase two
[oh] so at the end of the day still got the safe distancing measures [lah]
[oh] so <malay>sekarang</malay> means <malay>ikut</malay> shift [ah] <malay>dia punya macam</malay> wedding or like
[oh] cause from what I know is like next week I have a <malay>jemputan</malay>
then I got wedding I need to go to [lah] next week then is
(err) from what I know they got three shifts starting from morning all the way to the afternoon
then they separate by like family and friends
cause from what they told me is that now only I think about <malay>lima puluh</malay>
people per like per time [ah]
so that they still adhere to all the the safe distancing measures and now also
the table <malay>sudah nak kena</malay> be (err) separated
then there's no like what intermingling [lah] between each of the people that are going to be there so the functional groups do not counts [lah]
ya I mean at end of the day this kind of things how to say this [ah] is like
it definitely affects how we carry things out like socially [lah] it goes against like social like norms
cause you go to a wedding to interact with other people and all that and but then I think given the
kind of situation
like I mean get to see each other also
I mean should be grateful [lah]
ya
[oh] no serious serious like my uncle's
(err) wait my uncle's sister wait that's my aunt ya my aunt is getting married
ya
okay [ah]
[eh] then that time your I remember you posted something about (err)
<malay>kat</malay> your instagram story right <malay>pasal</malay> (err) the new system
ya that one I'm not
ya
<malay>tapi</malay>
okay okay
okay
okay from what I saw there's like (err) a bit of a
contention here right because (uh)
some people say that (err)
you get certain score and all that then doesn't make you eligible to <malay>masuk</malay> like
or poly or something ya ya
something like that [lah] from that's what I understand [lah] but I haven't really read into it yet [lah] so
if you understand then you can explain a bit [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
okay
[oh]
but I mean this kind of things if it's going to affect primary school then of course I think
(err) will also affect judging from (err) taking O levels and going to what tertiary education as well [lah]
ya
speak
[ah]
I think for me I think it's the same for both of us [lah] especially
(err) cause both of us are going off field and all that then <malay>kat dalam hutan</malay>
<malay>sudah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> signal <malay>tak ada</malay> handphone <malay>pula</malay>
<malay>tak akan nak</malay> check news [kan] I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
I still need to focus on getting things done and obviously focus on going home or booking out right
ya I mean obviously I think it's quite boring now
but then I guess in the future there'd be
maybe we'll need to use what we learn in army for our own good [lah] ya
so I think
okay I just ask you honestly [ah] do you any see do you see any purpose in doing now or not [ah]
ya
understand understand
ya
ya
you learn life the life lessons that you learn are social [lah]
<malay>macam mana nak cakap dengan orang macam mana nak apa</malay>
work with people
who are from like different different backgrounds like they all come from different areas [lah]
can or not
ya
like your own circle [lah] ya I I agree with you about that [lah] I think
also for me I'm having the same experience army
just give me the opportunity to <malay>jumpa</malay> new people to interact more with (err)
people outside my own social circle and
(err) I got to make new friends [ah] which is quite good also
and at end of the day I feel
that
(err) these two years (err)
<malay>tak</malay> wasted [lah] ya I really get to use it to
how to say this not only I guess to a certain extent serve the country but also
ya [lah] I mean we all have our different opinions about [lah] but so far ya the year is going to pass soon
ya these two years will not be wasted and I'll still get to
enjoy it [lah] while it lasts ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>kalau</malay> if you ask me personally whether I would
go to or choose to go or not to go
I'd say I think I would choose to not go [lah] because I feel
like (err)
I can (err)
give back more to the <malay>masyarakat</malay>
well when I'm outside [lah] as in cause you think about it now I'm at my prime
[eh] I'm at I'm at my prime of my youth
right I mean <malay>aku masih muda lagi</malay>
I still go I can go out I can go help out treat my parents all that like they all am I as I think
most importantly is like my grandparents [lah] now is like the best time for me to after right
(um) you know I take a short break I go help out my grandparents for a while and all that before I start school and all that I think that will be what I want to do and learn
you know travel around the world all that but okay obviously now maybe it's the best time
to be in cause I can't really
do anything else [lah] ya because of the whole COVID thing I can't really travel also ya but
I think okay [ah] now looking back (err)
it's not such a bad deal [lah]
(mm)
really [meh] you think it will really
help us [meh] like cake
[oh] okay fair enough
yes
(mm)
okay okay I mean
ya I guess I (uh) I mean this is no brain right so
ya let's jump right of the next bed let's go (err) #amshar# what do you like to do over the weekend when you're not in
actually no let's change it now like
let's just say (uh) you're going out with your family
then what are the things like (uh) <malay>kau</malay> guys <malay>kau buat</malay>
what's the activities <malay>yang kau suka buat</malay> like say on a weekend [lah] ya
maybe go to the beach <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>ke</malay>
okay <malay>pergi makan</malay>
I think those kind of places really got the vibes [ah] ya
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you <malay>masuk</malay> camp
you really just feel like (uh) you're shut out from the world already then when you go outside that's when you can really spend time with your loved ones [lah]
ya and especially when you eat home cooked food
I think that's the one [oh] when my mum <malay>masak</malay> you know
ya that's
ya that that's definitely a different experience [lah] then when you are inside camp when the meals are all provided for you
ya but for me personally I think
like what my family <malay>suka buat kalau</malay> on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is (err) <malay>bila</malay> everyone is
(err) free [kan] everyone got (uh) no plans so we all just go (err) at least have a meal [lah] together
and most of the time (err) my mum will cook and then (err)
we just make it a point to just sit down together at a table and eat [ah]
you worst comes to worst is (err)
how you call that we just order in food [lah] if everyone too tired
ya but
sometimes when there's a bit more free time or I'm blocked leave and now especially school holidays [kan]
my <malay>adik</malay> and my mum they're free
so
even though (err) we then we will go out like
(err) walking or cycling [lah] just around the area cause I stay (err) <malay>dekat dengan apa tu</malay> east coast
so <malay>kalau nak pergi</malay> beach <malay>pun</malay> (err) <malay>tak jauh sangat</malay>
ya so
<malay>kalau hujan lebat</malay> then okay [lah] that's when
we actually we stay in the car then we just drive around singapore [lah] you know that kind of thing
ya it's just it's just about spending time with your loved ones [lah]
ya
I think for me I like to
make it like <malay>seimbang</malay> you know (err) just have a balance
so betweeen spending time with my family and friends because both of them are
are as equal importance to me [lah]
ya because friends are what (uh)
has made me like (uh) what I am today for the
how could I say [ah] for like the latter part of my life so far but family
ya most of the chapter of my life I'm thinking about my friends [lah]
but my family is the one that raised me and had been with me throughout my entire life
so I definitely owe it to them ya and I genuinely (err)
(uh) enjoy spending time with them [lah] ya
so it it's definitely I think a struggle cause
<malay>kalau</malay> weekends you think about it you only have <malay>dua puluh empat jam</malay>
so the
timing <malay>yang kita ada</malay> is definitely limited
so it's all about (err) that
what you call that
balance [lah] between (err) spending time with
(err) your family and your friends
I think definitely another thing we should talk about is the challenges
with the allowance that we get
your money how do you spend your money on #amshar#
ya
me ya actually
I'm quite open if we my parents so lately
<malay>kalau</malay> anything about <malay>pun</malay> I'm not so afraid to just <malay>bilang dia orang</malay> [ah]
ya I just share with them then they just share me you know how father [lah] right they talk about
[eh] last time <malay>dulu aku</malay> <malay>papa pun buat ini buat ini</malay> like last
<malay>kalau dulu lagi susah</malay>
[ah] <malay>dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena</malay> march and don't know what
cannot what it's all they will just exaggerate the stories until it becomes so extreme
and I know they consider us the strawberry generation [lah] having it easier than them right so
it's nice to have a conversation topic you know with you parents a very natural conversation topic
ya then I guess to a certain extent it brings them together [lah] like they say it's (err) every singaporean son's journey right so
it's something that (uh) helps
maybe it helps me feel closer to my parents if not my dad [lah] ya and my brother also
ya
I think for me I had
wait I I was also enlisted in #tekong# so <malay>jadi</malay>
my family also <malay>ikut pergi sampai</malay> #tekong# and then they all
haven't haven't yet because it was still in january [mah]
so ya we all went
ya we only start just about I think a month apart so we're kind of in the same batch just the batch after yours [lah]
cause we're already went in batches then I remember that first day
my whole family follow me I think was me my
mum and dad <malay>adik</malay> and my [eh] my <malay>adik</malay>
and my <malay>nenek</malay> my (err) <malay>makcik</malay>
what
ya cause (err) I don't know people had extra then they just give me [ah]
so the five of us just went in together then
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> first day [kan]
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so <malay>dia orang</malay> give the best food [lah] that they have
so obviously it was a western wednesday that they even there was a
what it was a tuesday I think ya or monday [lah] ya
and one of the worst workout days
then [ah] I remember that day !wah! <malay>boleh nangis</malay> [seh]
[ah] first thing I went back to bunk [ah] I just
like !wah! what am I doing
[ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [lah] haven't been so
far away from my family in in awhile [lah] doing something that
I didn't (uh) explicitly choose to do [lah]
let's just put it like that
ya
ya but then I think compared to
my batch my batch didn't exactly get the
full experience cause (uh) we didn't get to at
marina bay you know that whole (err) walk
across east coast and all that walking together then
all <malay>nyanyi-nyanyi</malay> right all <malay>bising-bising</malay>
going through all the tiredness all the fatigue together
carrying everything back I mean we
didn't manage to do that [lah] but because my batch was more like
we just ended up at the parade square then we just there
then we call it a day then we went home
although we lost that bit of it I think
since my batch was longer I got really close to my
friends [lah] and some of them they had followed me all the way to my new unit also which is
quite good [lah] then we'd be even closer ya
no ours was ours <malay>dua belas</malay> I think
[ah] the most recent batch they did twenty four
(err) [oh] #changi# food food center right east coast east coast food center ya
but
I mean it's all about that (um)
encouragement and that feeling of like you know you are finally finishing
of like that journey right so
I think is I mean they give it to you all [lah] [ah] you finished
ya that nine weeks of then you just
I mean you feel good about yourself [lah]
like before you go into your unit or your next phase of training [ah]
ya
yes
I mean it's not for everyone [lah] bro
[oh] ya ya that's true
(mm)
okay
okay
(mm)
okay I think this kind of thing is like at first I was also wondering why then that's when I really started to
<malay>macam</malay> total check my financial spending [ah] and really pen down pen and paper what
I spend my money on [lah] so you know the money that I get I just
think about it (err) the <malay>duit</malay> that I
(err) set aside for <malay>macam macam</malay> transport [kan]
it's already like this much
then after that <malay>kalau</malay> transport there and back cause I don't know <malay>selalu aku</malay> take grab [lah]
then it's like I feel like ya it's easier [what] I mean taking is cheaper
but time is definitely of the essence in this case cause I always want to
what book out early book in late [ah] ya so
what
[oh] the the amount of money I spend on
transport (err) food
and then after that (err) miscellaneous stuff they are like things that you just have to spend money on let's just say
(err)
going to like gift shop or the emart
to buy army supplies so these kind of things
it gets (err) what you call that you don't really think about it [lah]
at first glance then there comes the
other things that you don't need but you want [lah]
so that's when you really need to be more
(err) careful with the where you spend the <malay>duit</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
honestly correct correct (um) [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
slightly more [lah] ya you don't save
ya
but I think it's the this time is the perfect like opportunity for you to
start <malay>menjimatkan wang</malay> [lah] (uh) especially now that
you're really getting (um)
that taste of financial freedom
especially on your on your own right so you really can decide what you want to do with your money
ya sometimes [ah] I understand
like what you said [lah] like when I first got it also I was like !wah! I'm actually finally getting money then I end up
<malay>beli</malay> mcdonald's <malay>beli</malay> what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow [lah] at the start then can go out <malay>beli baju</malay> [kan]
all the useless useless things that I don't really need
but then I want to buy cause I
finally have the
capability to buy them you know
ya then that's when I
(err) I started like really writing down everything cause I was wondering
where all my money went
ya then then then you realize (err) actually
there's a lot more that you can do with your money and one thing that
people are doing now is that they're really making their money work for them [lah]
come on especially right so with all the investing and all that
ya which
which I'm not so sure how it works I'm going to be honest but
now (err) <malay>sebab</malay> all got the <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> the elections [kan]
ya I think everyone is just putting their money in it then they're waiting for the results now [lah]
because it will determine whether they earn money or lose money [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya I think I mean
I understand [lah] maybe this generation is
the the mindset is a lot more different I guess certain extend it's like it's more towards like
(err) a lot a lot more people from our generation are thinking ahead
as as compared to (err) trying spending their money [lah] feeling that
I mean trying to (err) not to say like enjoy now [lah]
but (err) saving the money for retirement per se
that kind of thing or for their further studies and all that
cause (err) <malay>kalau</malay> you look at it right now
I feel that
more of us are more aware of what our
our future is like
you know and what how much we need
for our for us to like live a better life in the future [lah] ya so that we can always (err)
like help our family out [lah] or
at at the least like help ourselves out and not be a burden to others [lah]
ya so more of us are becoming more financially aware
and more
and hopefully financially stable [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
four [lah] four
ya okay
(mm) ya
ya [lah] [ah] ya I understand where you come from [lah]
[ah] ya
(mm)
I think for for our generation it is like
[ah] no as in from what I've seen they're still
I think some people are from especially my seniors [lah]
some of them like <malay>kasihan juga</malay> [lah] you look at them then they're like if they end up
(err) just <malay>buang</malay> all their <malay>duit</malay> during cause they ya our seniors [ah]
all <malay>buang</malay> their <malay>duit</malay> during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
since they're all what you call that [ah]
cause you know that that (err) we have that break routine (um)
when once you then the start school then they go overseas all that spend all their money right
then when you start uni then you really feel the crunch but you
don't have enough money [lah] for yourself
ya then
because of that you don't really get to
(err) fully enjoy your your life I guess
because you think about it let's just say you
spend all your money in one shot you don't get to spend it like
(err) throughout
I mean throughout your university before you actually like
get like a stable job [lah]
ya and I guess the purpose of
really like gives you that a bit of a headstart for you to have (err) financial independence [ah]
and really (err) how to say (err) <malay>jaga</malay> your own money
and (um) do what you want with it [lah]
(mmhmm)
(uh huh) yes
ya
ya
I think for me like what you asked just now right (uh) <malay>tadi</malay> you said
what was my plan right for investing I think for me it's not so much about (um) investing but
(uh) what (uh) I want to do is that
I guess it for the next year I will try to get a scholarship [lah] that's something I would like to work towards to [lah]
cause definitely I really don't want to <malay>bebankan</malay> my parents financially [lah] and most of the
spending I'd definitely want to do it myself
and for the uni fees all that I really
how to say [ah] they like what you've said they've been supporting you whole life like maybe it's time you really take things into your own hands [ah]
ya and really just (err) be more
independent ya
but then if that doesn't work out !whoa!
maybe I might even consider signing on [lah]
cause okay if you think about it it's a
it's (uh) realistic it's realistic it's worth especially (um)
<malay>kalau</malay> extend contract [kan] <malay>jadi sampai</malay> cause
the idea is that (err) <malay>kalau</malay> we stay longer <malay>kat dalam</malay> camp
(err) you don't spend money as much
definitely because food okay realistically food is provided for by the cook house
okay I won't say it's amazing
<malay>tapi</malay> (mm) <malay>tak tak sedap sangat</malay>
I mean <malay>tak</malay> it's not that bad
ya it's acceptable [lah] ya and it's like
basically food outside is nicer but I mean I can't complain [what]
right so ya and then you the more time you spend inside
you don't spend so much money outside and then because of that you can save more
and because you can save more you can do more money with your money outside
right then
I guess by extending our contract you already give yourself a headstart of going into like
a tertiary education [ah] or in my case I guess uni [lah] so
by doing that really
(um) provides me with an excess of cash that
allows me to
okay so where were we [ah]
I think was about being like (um) financially independent and
being able to spend your money the way you want to but at least
like (uh) <malay>tak jadi beban</malay> to your parents [ah]
ya I think that's what more things are
are things people my age are noticing becoming more
(err) responsible in that particular aspect of their live [lah]
which I think is definitely a good step ahead
if you think about it [lah] because everyone is (um)
how to say it's not about
(mm) not wanting to accept help from your parents but it's about wanting to really
being able to (err)
take your [ah] carry your own weight ya and really (err) feel the sense of (um)
what you call that of that reality you know that your parents have might should have led you from [lah] over these past few years [lah]
ya definitely [lah]
can we talk about food now #amshar# please
okay
ya I don't know how we ended up talking about and all
<malay>tapi</malay> now
okay <malay>tapi</malay> now I feel like ya let's just talk about <malay>makanan</malay> [ah] really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
ya [eh] so #amshar# [ah] what's your favourite food
!huh!
ya
I think what's your favourite food
ya
the what
[oh] [oh] scone scone
ya
of course halal most important bro
ya
I think for me it's not about
having a favourite food but because eat I don't know I feel like eating for me is always a reason for me to socialize
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like [eh] you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily <malay>lapar</malay> or anything
<malay>tapi</malay> it's just a excuse for me to like
(err) <malay>jumpa kawan jumpa</malay> family
no [ah] like it's something that helps me
(err) <malay>eratkan silaturahim</malay> [lah] with people people that
people around me that I know
and I talk to so
eating is more of a social thing to me rather than
being (um)
ya for the taste of it [lah] and
that's why when I eat I don't necessarily
have any (err) preference of what I want to eat I just only generally ask what people like to eat then I just go eat there
like you say <malay>asalkan halal</malay> I'm steady [lah]
ya so
for me if you ask me what's my favourite food I like comfort food [lah]
comfort food
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>kampung</malay> food !aiya! nevermind [lah] bro
#hajjah maimunah# bro #hajjah maimunah# expensive bro
okay
is booming is booming
no that's not even
<malay>apa kalau kau beli rendang</malay> right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know [ah] I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is <malay>sotong</malay>
so you you buy <malay>sotong</malay> that time
<malay>bulan puasa</malay> then my family <malay>pergi</malay> #geylang# [kan] <malay>nak makan</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> okay not <malay>makan</malay> sorry <malay>nak beli untuk buka lauk</malay> [ah]
standard [ah] you'll pack away take away <malay>lauk</malay> right
then I remember bought (um)
call that (err) <malay>sotong</malay> right the
<malay>sotong hitam sotong hitam</malay> that was the big squid then it was like what
eight dollars for one head
!wah! that was like ridiculous man
so
okay the business is booming
definitely because there are people that love that kind of food
and obviously I like it [lah] ya but you cannot eat it too much and too often
ya
bro it doesn't help that the food is like delicious
ya
[a'ah]
okay [lah] okay so we're talking wait [ah] so I was as I was saying right so let's just say
but if you ask me about my favorite food right I know I feel like
a strong inclination towards #ban mian#
#ban mian#
soup is like really something that !wah! I feel like [ah] #tom yum# also but #tom yum# is definitely maggi for me bro
ya like if I eat #tom yum# right the maggi one it just hits different [lah] I think
in my opinion ya <malay>sebab kalau lapar</malay> [kan] a quick fix
would definitely be instant noodles
ya then <malay>sebab</malay> it's convenient
then it's also quite easy to make [lah] then like that I also don't have to what
(err) wake up the whole family to cook right
so I just cook on my own and then just and then it's a sharing thing also
so you don't always don't just cook maggi one person
let's cook maggi for more
cause your ya
like then
it goes back to a social thing
ya I mean it's like food is not just about
(err) for sustenance per se but it's all about (um)
looking out for others also
no then I guess that's what can really bring people together also [lah]
ya
okay [lah]
just feel that just taste of food in your mouth [ah]
[oh] swimming lessons ya ya ya I remember that time
[oh] ya we'll stand outside the the convenience shop and then we just
(err) stand in one row right then <malay>semua beli</malay> maggi then <malay>tambah telur</malay>
then the <malay>telur selalu macam tak masak apa</malay> the aunty will say [eh] <malay>setengah masak</malay> but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just <malay>kacau</malay> everything then <malay>makan terus</malay>
!wah! I think now is like really the best [lah]
!wah! is that !wah! then the keep brings back memories so like
like what you said [lah] I think it's a it's a
is in
ya
back then we ate a lot less ya
[oh] bulking season bro
ya
ya
#encik tan# #encik tan# bro that's like the go to <malay>nasi</malay>
[oh] ya
I think [eh] two I remember when
ya when when I was studying for A levels right I don't my I don't know cause when I was in J one
my weight was sixty five kilo
then after that it <malay>naik sampai berapa</malay> [eh]
<malay>sampai tujuh puluh lapan</malay> bro
ya it's like I went up by about fifteen or so in like a year
because I was just stressed out from studying A levels [lah] and food was something that gave me comfort [lah]
ya cause okay cause you think about it right you can't
there is no way right <malay>kau boleh belajar</malay> and study at the same time
so right
ya is ya [oh] sorry <malay>makan dan belajar</malay> at the same time sorry
so cause the moment I'm eating means I'm not studying
correct so I'll I'll just eat like I'll eat a lot so like
feeling [lah] [ah] ya [lah] so
that that that the break time right was really very precious [lah]
so obviously you try to extend it as much as possible because of that I ate so much
then I just well just studying eating studying eating studying eating then what it said it was eating
not say purely for sustenance [ah] but so you don't feel so bored
cause the moment you're studying (err) the moment you're eating you are taking a break from all your books all that
then you get you that is quite boring [lah]
ya so I feel like
that time was a
it was a good time that I just ate the same type of food everyday
that's ridiculously unhealthy
ya but I didn't mind it
(mmhmm)
then after that go back to study again
ya it's it's like the same cycle everyday
(mm)
(mm)
ya but I I I think I
for me personally I cannot forget the school canteen food yet
the what I remember cause cause coming from our school was like
(um) what you call that there's very remember there's only what two halal stalls is it
there was only two halal stalls so the options for the muslim students were not really that much also [lah]
so <malay>jadi</malay> we had to make do with what we had then
usually <malay>kita beli</malay> what (err) just <malay>nasi campur</malay>
or the <malay>india punya makanan</malay> [ah]
ya so it's like
what we had was what (err) <malay>nasi padang</malay> right
<malay>nasi padang</malay> and the #asagani# stall
[ah] they had they had the only they for the #roti# #prata# which is like not even allowed
[oh] so fucker level and the food was so good
ya
[oh] do you remember when (err) <malay>dulu</malay>
when we used to <malay>beli</malay> the <malay>nasi goreng</malay> first right then we just ask [eh] <malay>ada nasi kway</malay>
<malay>cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng</malay> then she'll be like
[eh] <malay>ada ada</malay> okay okay (err) <malay>jangan bilang orang</malay> then we
ya then we'll buy that was a definitely a secret menu item
then when people started looking [eh] bro what's this [ah] what's this then after that
suddenly it's like everyone knew what <malay>nasi goreng</malay> was
then we all start everyone started ordering and then there was this (err)
honestly it was I think it was a different type of <malay>nasi goreng</malay> I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no <malay>nasi goreng</malay> that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
!hey! it was a super spicy <malay>nasi goreng</malay>
it was like !wah! really if I go eat there again that would definitely bring back memories [ah]
ya
and
that's that's that's that's the thing [lah] because
food was
what like bond us together cause the only time we met each other right definitely was at the canteen
ya and there's only reason one reason you're at the canteen it's either you're skipping lectures or you're eating something
and most of more often than not we'll be eating something
<malay>bulan puasa</malay> bro
ya I mean if you're awake [lah]
that's a
prerequisite
(uh)
[eh] but speaking of food right do you cook
okay <malay>bukannya susah sangat</malay>
ya [lah]
<malay>betul betul</malay> okay understand
[ah] yes
it's such a millennial thing to do to use an air fryer
you know it's really not that much healthier in my opinion it's like (uh) you're still cooking it in fat
but it's just it's own fat
ya okay so I guess if you ask me I mean
I try to <malay>masak</malay> [lah] sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got [oh] actually I won't say it's <malay>masak</malay> but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was [eh] that time remember <malay>bulan puasa</malay>
I made (err) (err) <malay>suji</malay> for everyone
ya !wah! that was a absolute (err) logistic nightmare
because <malay>tak boleh agak</malay> how much (err) <malay>ramuan</malay> you need right
and all the <malay>sukatan-sukatan</malay> all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time <malay>buat</malay> then they say [eh]
this one can make forty then come out !wah! twenty five pieces only then I was like what you want me to do
obviously I it's my first time again
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny <malay>suji</malay> right
ya then
obviously that's terrible right so I had to make like two to three batches if I'm not wrong
then <malay>sudah sudah sudah habis buat</malay> then <malay>dia punya</malay> what you call that
when I made the (err) the whole <malay>aduan</malay> right it was a bit
(um) wet
then I have to [oh] (err) ask my mum [eh] what to do what to do then my mum also not really a baker
fair so like okay so we figured out okay !alamak! just add more flour [lah] that kind of thing so it's like it makes it more
(err) usable [lah] ya then experiment that's when
you really figure out like [eh] actually it's a lot more feeling than to actually
(err) know the exact quantities of what you need to use cause you given the humidity and all that it all the that kind of thing plays a part
temperature of your surroundings
ya you don't think about that and your recipe doesn't tell you about that also
ya
I mean ya [lah] ya [lah]
but as a new cook all these all these kind of things are definitely out of your control [what]
so when I tried to make <malay>kuih</malay> for the first time that's what happened [ah] then the <malay>suji</malay> came out
some came out nice some came out cracked then you like [eh] why
so I end up eating the cracked ones the nice ones I give away [lah]
ya so I don't know that's just quite fun [lah] I remember I'll go to everyone's house
then (err) slowly drop off one by one
and you know (uh)
ya I dodged his mum so I I stay in the
I stay in the east area then this <malay>amshar pula tinggal kat</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> woodlands [kan] <malay>jauh gila</malay> so obviously
<malay>nak naik</malay> train <malay>pun</malay> I took like one and the half hours so
!wah! <malay>memang</malay> but that day <malay>sempat</malay> [lah]
that trip was just for you bro
<malay>sempat sempat balik</malay> #bedok# by <malay>buka</malay> [seh]
cause I left quite late I remember [oh] then I stopped by #ang mo kio# I wanted to meet <malay>tok mat</malay> to pass him the <malay>suji</malay> then he gave me another whole
(um) what you call that a whole container of <malay>kuih</malay> tart in return so
that's quite nice also [lah] ya
I mean because that time I remember it was
what was it [ah] it was [oh] <malay>hari raya</malay> [oh] I was I had leave
cause it was the COVID thing
no no (uh)
ya is no bro is the eve of <malay>raya</malay> bro
ya
and you had your interview
ya [lah]
ya you got your interview that's why I asked you to meet me at the then you're like
[eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] I got interview then I was like [oh] okay [lah] then I go to your house [ah]
<malay>nasib baik</malay> I remember where you stay [sia]
(err) (err) ya
is not bad not bad
[ha] !wah! the things I do !huh! for my friends
(uh)
no [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit <malay>kekok</malay> but but why did the the baking thing was that
I generally just wanted to try baking it and see what you all thought of it [lah]
because obviously I cook what twenty five pieces of
<malay>suji</malay> for myself it's just [dah]
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] for me to eat everything [oh] what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two <malay>sudah</malay> a bit <malay>muak sikit</malay> [kan]
so I might as well just give it away [lah] then the other thing you were saying about
you naturally you're helping people out on the street all that
that one is still that's still (err) like a blur for me because
let's say <malay>kalau</malay> I'm outside [kan] then I see people <malay>macam</malay>
need help especially older people <malay>naik naik</malay> bus that kind of thing then <malay>angkat</malay> the bag all like go inside right
the thing is (um) how to say this [ah] that time I help someone then he said that
actually she doesn't need my help
cause she has done this many times it's just that she's a bit slower
so at the end of the day right I also feel
#paiseh# [kan] because if you think about it [eh] [ah] <malay>memandai</malay> [jer] <malay>nak tolong</malay>
then (err) obviously she understands that <malay>aku pun nak</malay> she understands that <malay>aku pun nak tolong dia</malay> [kan]
but then (err) she knows the she can do it on her own so she doesn't
want to seem like she needs help [lah]
and obviously I want to respect her decision but at the same
same time [ah] you can't help but
notice that [eh] you're kind of holding up the queue [lah] so
I should probably make you go a bit faster [lah]
but then I (um) feel like I don't want feel like I'm undermining her effort
you know of trying to being independent
how [ah]
ya
yes [eh] definitely
(mmhmm)
ya
ya because ya I understand
ya
ya
because there she cannot reach understand understand ya
ya
I
(mm)
understand understand
ya
but at the end of the day they they know that they they need your help [lah]
ya there are certain things that they definitely cannot do and it's rather to
and they rather choose to avoid it [lah] but at the same time that's when you guys come in [lah] when you guys help out
I think like from personal experience (um)
you know that (um)
you have to be sensitive [lah] be more aware of this kind of things so this kind of issues you
you cannot say them out loud
definitely because it can hurt people's feelings
but it's something that you have to consider when you're about to help someone [lah] especially elderly person
ya [oh] my god how did it run out of topic
again by so far
okay then let's just
bring it back the thing it was about you talk about
eat [eh] helping your friends [oh] talk about friends right then you
[ah] then you talk about helping others on the street
ya
okay
[oh] my goodness wait where were we
ya let's just go back to food I feel like that's a good consensus okay
you know right I think in my opinion
a lot of people have this misconception that
<malay>kalau</malay> the <malay>makanan</malay> [kan] is halal right it will be less
sedap</malay> then if it was not halal
I think
ya
ya
okay definitely ya
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
okay
no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about more is like (err) more to being (uh) okay being like
the
ya in general in general ya because because the
the amount of food that we can eat right is definitely there's definitely a restriction
so in a certain sense you'll feel like [eh] you're
how how do I say this (mm) like when you go out with your group of friends
then you just see you're the only muslim guy there the only practising muslim guy there who needs to eat halal food
to a certain extent you feel like you're doing slight inconvenience
that they have to go eat at a halal restaurant I think this is a
it's a it's a it's a known thing [lah] !huh!
cause like let's just say [eh] (err)
let's go eat [ah] #din tai fung# you know obviously that's a no go for me
but then (err) <malay>aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang</malay> right
ya <malay>ambil hati</malay> also then they also <malay>tak nak</malay>
(um) make us feel bad so they will just (err) go to somewhere we can eat [lah]
and end up we go to the same place every single time
eighteen chefs bro eighteen chefs is the go to bro
ya then
at the end of the day it's like
these food options they are still there but
just that it's it's (err) slightly limited [lah]
according to what we eat and and I don't know I have to admit from what I've noticed that
(um) let's just say you're eating halal food obviously different cultures have
(um)
halal versions of their food also and a lot of people are doing that
but these tends to be more expensive
than usual
like okay then in my opinion let's just say you go (uh) there's a lot of cheap #ramen# stalls
ya [lah] let's just say #ramen# stalls but they're not halal
cheaper #ramen# stalls but then for the halal versions of these kind of stalls right I think a lot of prices are quite expensive and
ya because they're halal and there's definitely a demand for it
so I feel that to a certain extent this is not fair
and then when we go as a group also then !wah! the obviously the receipt be quite expensive [lah]
then it's not fair to them because there's like offers on like
other shops and all that
so it's it's more about the variety I think that's the issue here
ya but then again I don't want to restrict my friends from not eating pork you know what I mean
ya like okay I'm I'm definitely fine with you eating pork but it's like
ya it doesn't affect me it's just it's just a personal stand when I see it's like
[eh] actually I feel bad <malay>macam</malay> I I don't I
I don't want to make them feel #paiseh# also
ya what you want to eat
so I guess what
they I mean they say don't mind [lah] but sometimes like what I've have done is that
I just go and sit somewhere there also [lah] but I don't eat also
ya just sit in and then you just
talk [lah] because at the end of the day like [eh] actually it goes back to the same point where
for me eating right is more of a socializing
thing rather than actually having to eat because I can eat anytime bro at home there's always food
ya there's always that ice cream container inside with
ya with no ice cream and not what you call that (uh) but I've no no what's that (err)
[ah] <malay>kari asam pedas</malay> bro that that nestle ice cream container got <malay>asam pedas</malay>
that's it's like ya and it's never
what the neopolitan one [ah]
ya [eh] that's definitely a piece of your childhood right there
ya okay
then I think if you like going back to that point right it's like
I don't know [ah] there's no solution for this it's just something I felt like talking about
but <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you
take to the edit [ah] there certain definitely there certain places with
a higher concentration of halal food as compared to other places [lah]
[ah] like okay I meant #bugis# #paya lebar# or #bugis# bro
so many halal food there and but it's definitely more like cafes and all that
so it's definitely on the more expensive end
ya but then (err) the my other halal option is (uh) <malay>mamak</malay> [lah]
<malay>mamak</malay> stall [lah] bro supper club
that kind of stuff ya that's the easy option
and they don't mind but I tell you I can't eat #prata# every single day bro
#prata# is not I can't live on #prata# bro ya
(mm) (uh) (mm)
ya
ya definitely
especially here especially here
yes no actually that's why I think it's a good thing that
the government is like trying to push for using more healthier ingredients and you can see this a lot in
[ah] infomercials that's why there's <malay>kalau kau tengok jamaah</malay> [kan] one #suria# and all that
they've (err) they're slightly no update okay it's very obvious
obvious and (uh) they're slightly cringey
(err) what you call that national (err) health promotion board [ah]
what you call they try to insight
healthier choice references into like certain malay #jamaahs# right
so obvious [eh] like [eh] [ah] <malay>abang</malay>
<malay>pakai apa tu</malay>
(err) <malay>susu biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>tak payah pakai</malay>
(err) coconut milk and all that right
so when you see this kind of thing it's like okay obviously they are pushing for it so that people
will like [oh] actually there's healthier versions of this kind of food that we can eat then you can actually eat more of it [lah] and
to a certain extent the taste will change a bit but for the most part it'll be the same [lah]
like cause it's still the same dish [mah]
ya and
like what I said it is definitely not obesity diabetes is definitely a big problem
like ya !huh! so
(hmm)
I think but to be honest is
I wouldn't think it's from our generation it's all the older generation mostly because
the the diet has and will always be consist of (err) will always comprise of
that [lah] of that kind of traditional food
definitely definitely you can change bro but (uh) you have to understand the
mindset and the
practice of someone who's (err) older right it's definitely something very difficult to
(err) change or enforce it's it's definitely it's definitely it's like
it has to come in like very slow stages [lah]
ya
[ah] yes yes yes
[ah] bro then when the #teh# O is like what three scoops of three bold scoops of sugar
[eh] ya understand
but they don't
ya and and I can understand where they're are going from we've been doing this our whole life why should we change
ya they're still okay and it tastes ya ya definitely I agree ya
[ha] [ha] I think I see this most often about my <malay>nenek</malay> [lah]
ya [ah] that's why they cook the nicest food
but you definitely cannot go there and eat there every single week
they're having that's that's just too much
no we my my family makes it a point that we just bring our own food there so they don't cook
so we bring when we bring our food we tell them in advance and then we bring like healthier food [lah]
so the
ya they they I mean in general my <malay>nenek</malay> cooks everyday
but we only go there every week [lah]
that's when we are all are free [mah] cause if we go there that's when the whole family is together
so we can go there every weekend [lah] or so
ya so
ya
also
to a certain extent because okay imagine like
(err) this kind because like I mean (uh) for
for for starters my <malay>nenek</malay> is quite open to all this also
so she definitely want to try new food also
then like because certain things that she cannot cook
especially like it's quite cool [lah] that's because she likes
to she doesn't mind eating sushi you know japanese food she doesn't mind anything
which is quite sick and this this this tends to
how do I say this I think it tends to be healthier
I mean especially like sashimi like that kind of stuff
ya I think sashimi is definitely healthier bro
it's just fish right so ya so we bring it over
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
I mean
I think by a long shot but ya
and sashimi is not with rice so on it's own already
ya ya [lah]
so like going back to that is
like when we bring we come over we'll bring food right so she doesn't
it's not that she doesn't have to cook because she insists that she definitely makes family [lah] because
[kan] <malay>ada tetamu datang</malay> obviously you have to prepare something right for them
so the guests feel I mean it's something that they hold to [lah] quite close [lah]
but because we <malay>sudah bawa makan</malay>
she prepare less [lah]
ya so that's that's a good thing that's a good start
ya <malay>tak payah susah sangat</malay>
I mean ya but I think ya okay
straying off topic again one of the unhealthy things that I will always look for to (err) weekends is definitely bubble tea [ah]
I don't know I'm a bubble tea kind of guy man it's like
what's your stand what's your stand
ya
it's a social thing social thing again
so you're peer pressured into buying it
chocolate [eh]
[ah]
[oh] so [oh] you're more of that old school bubble tea [lah] so you're talking about the oreo crush that kind of ice blended drinks is it
so I mean this brings back memories bro okay actually that's the thing because last time right
you know we used to <malay>beli</malay> [ah] sweet talk <malay>semua kat bawah</malay> block [kan]
and then got (err) sweet
I don't know man it just closed bro so
I remember it was what oreo crush will be like two dollars
in fact it was I think something it was less than two dollars then you you upsize it
!huh!
ya you upsize it to two fifty or three dollars
then now you !wah! you take a look at all the
standard bubble tea shops one cup is like three dollars [lah] at least
ya only if you use like special discount <malay>ke</malay>
or like or student card
okay which is not legal by the way
so it's like it's still then that's when it becomes like two dollars or even one fifty something like that
ya
I mean I I think I think about it that
these kind of things is
it's something that you enjoy on the weekends [lah] something like you don't really have all the time so
I think it's okay cause in camp you're definitely just drinking water
some other thing
dude I think I'll be I'll go crazy
definitely [ah] my money you will just disappear on poverty
okay I understand extend the contract [lah] you mean
ya bro I haven't considered signing on bro
ya
especially you'll be in a situation where you'll be more aware of your finances
ya
okay ya [lah] ya [lah] definitely [lah] I mean there's still a lot of ways to fill up your time
I forgot more beneficial if before starts
is easy it's an easier role ya you know what's going on
I think like
if you
like if you about about the food thing right let's just say
even though
you spend money like buying food outside and all that at the end of the day it would be better if you end up cooking
learning how to cook on your own because it's definitely a useful skill ya it's a skill that you should have in for your life because
at some point in your life you'll definitely be living alone
<malay>sudah tinggal seorang</malay>
okay <malay>kalau sudah ada kahwin</malay> okay <malay>sudah kahwin pun boleh</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak</malay> maggi
right obviously you also know that
that's not very sustainable so
if you want to eat something else [lah]
but this kind of thing is
definitely up to you
and up to your own preference [ah]
but
how you how you how you feel about that
ya I agree with you

[eh] long time no see bro how are you bro
[oh] you working as a steward is it I heard last time when I saw you at facebook
I saw your posting bro not bad [ah] <malay>kau dengan kau punya baju</malay> suit <malay>semua</malay> very classy [eh] not bad [eh]
<malay>berapa lama kau kerja sana</malay> [ah]
!wow! six months [eh]
so (uh) what's your favourite country
serious [ah]
saudi arabia
<malay>ye ke tapi aku dengar dorang cakap</malay> saudi arabia is a very corrupted country [tau]
(mm)
cause ya I saw a lot of news right especially the the prince [kan] the prince #sulaiman# he a lot of controversies about him and then you know now his his other neighbouring countries the arab countries [ah] have a lot of war and then his ties with the america <malay>nya</malay>
and then they have a lot of (uh) weapons (uh)
a lot of things [ah] so I don't really trust
arab countries but anyway I mean I think this is too much of a politic <malay>abeh kau bila kau kat</malay> saudi arabia <malay>selain solat kau buat apa sana</malay>
[oh] so if you were given another chance <malay>kau</malay> will travel saudi arabia or would you like to try <malay>negeri lain</malay>
spain
so speaking of football [kan] <malay>abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah</malay> stop <malay>macam kita orang juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>negara luar macam</malay> #messi# #ronaldo# <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang masih main ke</malay> or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
but how do they earn when there's no spectators cause I think that's a huge sum of money where they can get [kan] cause you pay then a lot of people watching the football so how they can earn their money besides the sponsors [ah]
!wow! so they really suffer [eh] so all industry are affected by this [eh]
<malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>tapi sementara</malay> [jer] bro cause [ah]
<malay>kalau kau tengok betul-betul</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang kau tengok</malay> electric <malay>punya</malay> tariff <malay>dah naik</malay> nine point three per cent <malay>abeh</malay> so I think the government will first
give you all these grants give you all this money but in the end they will take it back I mean technically is like a business
for for them [lah] but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can <malay>abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa</malay> ninja van [eh]
[oh] savings [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> slowly your savings will also
<malay>jadi kurang</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh kau tak</malay> worry [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> bro that [one] was just (uh) interview that I went to went for
but then I decided that you know (uh) I don't think I can last in that line
I'm more interested in the healthcare industry since [ah]
you know my my poly days I I took that course right healthcare and management so I thought maybe I would just venture into into this line and then if this COVID thing going on
(um) not bad [lah] you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not <malay>aku</malay> just try to continue so for now <malay>aku</malay> just (uh) <malay>aku kerja</malay> as a clinic assistant [ah]
which is quite tough [ah] <malay>banyak</malay> patients and
you know <malay>banyak</malay> demands
and I have to do a lot of things admin stuff but still (uh) no choice [ah] what to do [kan]
ya so these things are are the same [ah] so at the at the first few months these swabbers they will earn a lot of money and then now I heard that they
in fact they don't [ah] allow any swabbers anymore cause there's too much
even the doctors are doing it by themselves so
now they are encourage people to volunteer for for to become a swabbers
but as a clinic assistant [ah] I can tell you it's actually pretty safe [ah] cause you're fully protected you're under the the uniform
the protected gear [ah] [eh] and then (uh) quite safe [ah] <malay>kau kau kalau ikut</malay> all the safety protocols [ah] everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved [ah] I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since <malay>aku tak pernah ambil</malay> <malay>semua</malay> [seh] so <malay>aku</malay> maybe [ah] my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
(mm)
(mm) <malay>kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun</malay> there's a lot of a
people who try to work as grab food deliveries [eh]
(uh) and it's been a growing trend [ah] I see a lot of (uh) races actually (uh) branching into this line cause <malay>selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja</malay> grab food <malay>pun ye</malay> [lah] <malay>orang-orang kita</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak</malay> cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
times are hard so they will
they would they manage to sacrifice their dignity [eh]
I think [ah] then still I mean I wouldn't say dignity [ah] I mean that that job is you can earn quite a lot if you know how to play the game well [lah] I would say
(mm)
bro that [one] I think really depends on on the family that you're living with [ah] if you are living with your parents and then I mean that should be fine cause all of you are working if your parents are working as well or if they don't then you have to support them but if you are living with
know children and then your wife that's pretty tough though
<malay>kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja</malay> at least <malay>gaji aku</malay> [eh] <malay>aku</malay> at least <malay>rasa kena</malay> at least two point five and above [ah] <malay>itu pun</malay> depends <malay>kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja</malay> normal is quite risky [ah] <malay>kalau kau kerja macam</malay>
(err) <malay>gaji yang</malay> one K plus [jer] unless if you only living with your wife
then both of you are working then should be okay [ah]
(mm) that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays [ah] you know our generations especially <malay>tapi</malay> if you were to think about it
know the traditions <malay>tu yang susah tu</malay> the culture of our our race [kan] <malay>kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena</malay>
you know
[ah] have a lot of kids for our parents you know
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's true though
(um) actually depends on the expenses that you are
having then
ya but I I worry [ah] if in the future I mean now especially with the COVID situation
I I think (err) the new families are more worried to even have children
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves <malay>abeh macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>nak</malay> sustain <malay>kalau ada anak semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kena bayar</malay> bill
<malay>bayar susu</malay> diapers <malay>semua</malay> I mean of course definitely they they you know <malay>dapat</malay> baby bonus <malay>ni semua tapi berapa lama</malay> [seh] <malay>boleh tahan</malay>
<malay>tak boleh tahan</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya but singapore <malay>pun</malay>
I mean <malay>kau kena faham-faham</malay> [ah] singapore <malay>dorang akan kasi kau</malay> grants for free <malay>nya apa</malay>
they will definitely get it back
(err) like <malay>sekarang kau tengok dorang dah</malay> increase traffic [eh] electricity <malay>nya</malay> price <malay>nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik</malay> so but I mean the government they are doing their best [lah] I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country [kan] to remain at the top
despite the circumstance that we are in
<malay>abeh</malay> no choice [ah]
government I think government will try their best [lah] but we we still have to find ways [ah] no matter what <malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>kita kena</malay> hustle [ah] this is a hustling years [lah] just like <malay>macam dulu</malay> [ah] time SARS <malay>zaman</malay> SARS <malay>dulu pun dorang</malay>
economy <malay>pun jatuh tapi kau tengok</malay> slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves [ah] we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it [ah] <malay>orang cakap</malay>
bro mine I think around six hundred plus [ah] cause I have a siblings in the house [kan]
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing <malay>dah berapa</malay> [jer]
and if you living in a big house
a lot more family members you know
and then you use a lot of electricity or water
then if you have little you have low wages for I mean as as parents then it's really difficult [lah] for you to sustain
so and I think a lot of people are now hustling their way [ah] I mean legit especially I mean
grab food delivery riders out there you see a lot of people are trying their best working day and night
my I cannot really imagine [ah] but for now I I think I'm in the comfort zone so
sooner or later I think I really need to hustle [ah] if not if I don't have any savings for now still then in the future I'm not gonna rise [ah]
exactly
I think [ah] a lot of
things are affecting them
you know especially when it's you know you you've been quarantined inside the house
you you know some people say it's a blessing
cause you get to meet a lot of family members but (err) you forget to look on the other side of the coin where
if your family members are more aggressive
are more violent in a way so they are more trapped they are more stressed
and then they might hurt
the other family members [ah] so it's quite
quite a sad thing to hear
and then (err) you know
having to lose their jobs
you know all these stressful matters will definitely affect their mental health [ah] so that's why I think especially if you know if you have a lot of debt
so that's why I think most of them or some of them decided to kill themselves [lah] cause they cannot take it already [what]
and then so this why all these things [ah] need to to be considered but I think everyone is suffering in their own way so we really have to make do [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> personally <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
these things this [ah] period will go away
we just have to stay on and pursue and not give up [ah]
<malay>kalau tak</malay>
we
suffer bro
(mm)
(mm) true [ah] true
I think it's only important besides you know hustling for the money you also have to take care of our health [ah] legit
mental health physical health also
if you only focus on your work you can get sick
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body [ah] mentally physically <malay>aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak</malay> exercise <malay>tak</malay> you know take their time to you know relax to ease off <malay>kalau tak</malay>
<malay>kau pun boleh terjejas</malay> [ah] <malay>kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk</malay> [ah]
so it's really hard it's we are living in a hard time so we really have to you know our priorities
and to make sure it's it is well-balanced [ah] ya and it's it's easy to say but
you have to make do [ah] with whatever we can we have to change our schedule change our lifestyle for the time being [ah] no choice bro this is the hard time [ah] then
I really hope that this thing will go away [ah] seriously
ya of course bro
(mm)
(mm) true true I agree [ah]
but [ah] I'm not sure if there's any difference cause right now
(um) with this situation going on
<malay>macam lagi ramai orang</malay> I mean <malay>dorang dorang memang susah</malay> [pe] so I think <malay>macam aku nak cakap dorang dah</malay> get used to it [lah] <malay>abeh tapi</malay> I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
(err) people who's been living
(uh) wealthily <malay>macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini</malay> [kan] then <malay>dorang macam terus jadi</malay> stress <malay>sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini</malay> [kan]
so I think is very difficult for those who are
[ah] who are well-off [ah] as compared to those who who who has been living (err)
<malay>dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah</malay> so <malay>dorang</malay> might know what to do or might hustle even like normally [ah] they do like hustle really hard <malay>tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja</malay>
high position <malay>semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh</malay> survive [kan] <malay>gini</malay> so that's why <malay>dorang</malay> stress [kan]
but this is their difficult times
and then we have to fight through [ah] and speaking of which [kan] <malay>berbual pasal</malay> COVID <malay>aku</malay> recently <malay>baca</malay> news trump <malay>kena</malay> COVID is it true
but what you think of trump personally like do you know that the the way how he conduct the country how he see people I I heard that he's islamophobic I mean cause we are muslims [kan] what what do you what's your take on that
ya islamophobia
[oh]
<malay>aku tengok</malay> [ah] [siol] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing is <malay>kenapa</malay> china <malay>buat macam gini</malay> [eh] I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions <malay>macam</malay> I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
cause what they are doing is is basically cruel I mean and I think the whole world is against it or most of the countries I would say even america or the united states [eh] the [ah] ya (uh) the whole
<malay>apa ni</malay> world
organisations [eh] <malay>yang</malay> the one with <malay>apa</malay> united nations is it
<malay>dorang pun</malay> are against it [tau] <malay>abeh aku tak faham kenapa</malay> they are still doing this [eh] but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>buat ni tak ada orang boleh</malay> stop <malay>aku</malay>
you know simply cause they are
they are number one in the business
and they are controlling everything
so even though <malay>aku</malay> might say that I'm not
I'm not I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china [kan] <malay>aku</malay> might side with trump [ah] just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims [kan]
then <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's it's it's really cruel [ah] but I don't know why <malay>kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini</malay> [eh]
ya it it's so sad and so sick [ah] to be honest
yet the other countries are not I I don't think they are putting enough effort to stop their whatever they are doing [ah] I think it's it's too much [ah] to be honest
but like like like what I've said [ah] I think it's cause of the power that they are holding
you know in the business [ah] sector that's why (uh) most countries do not dare to to make any actions against them [ah]
which are <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's just too much [ah] to be honest this is just like <malay>macam zaman-zaman dulu</malay> [seh] if <malay>kalau kau belajar</malay> history <malay>kat</malay> secondary school <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau belajar kau tengok</malay> [ah] hitler <malay>kau tengok macam orang macam</malay> (um) stalin of what they have done
it's ironic [ah] we we study history and yet we we are doing nothing for the future to change what has happened to the past
we just repeating the same old thing you know wars
concentration camps and it's
it's it's just I don't know I don't see any change [ah] to be honest it's just
it's all about politics business
you know everyone wants to win a game and no one is really thinking about you know (err) what's ethically and morally right for everyone you know not just for the people who's in power
so it's <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's just it's just effed up [ah] <malay>aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman</malay> serious
(mm)
[oh] that that's
that's another actually interesting (uh) news [ah]
<malay>sebab setahu aku</malay> [eh]
the this black people they black people [kan] you know they have been living in america for so long
they have been going through a lot
you know especially with all those [ah] big (uh) big leaders last time (err) like #muhammad ali# the famous boxer and then
the black (err) civil rights activist <malay>ni semua</malay> they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
they still do not see
the black people as
as american which is quite
I don't know [ah] I don't understand what
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people <malay>macam</malay>
you know it's it's it's
it's just a colour [kan] why the whites feel so superior about it
I mean I may I may I may sound biased [lah] but it's it's the fact that whenever whenever you open the twitter or facebook you see all these injustice going on and I'm not saying there's no injustice between the black community itself [ah] but
it's just unfair [ah] cause the whites are just taking over and then they are taking advantage as much as they can just cause they are white
I mean it's stupid [ah]
(mm)
<malay>aku rasa tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
that's what I heard also [ah] <malay>macam apa ni dia ada</malay> counterfeit <malay>nya duit</malay> [kan]
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police <malay>dekat</malay> america is being
perform [ah]
I mean you just see one george floyd but you never know in other streets in other places where how how did they treat other black people they make it they may be killed silently without us knowing
without us being seen on the video clip without being recorded
so it's really I think it's the the the police system in america is just so
screwed-up and corrupted [lah] in in all aspects and this is just one side of it and the world whole world goes crazy
[ah] so <malay>kalau aku rasa kalau kau</malay> as an american [kan] <malay>kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
how the black people really feels to be
to be looked down upon
to be castrated and to be really being to take advantage of [ah] in all aspects even in their lives their lives doesn't really matter [tau] so it's really sad [ah]
<malay>aku tak aku tak</malay> imagine <malay>kalau</malay> this situation were to happen in singapore
<malay>kita sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>dah</malay> riot <malay>dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu</malay> country
<malay>apa lagi kalau</malay> legit <malay>kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau</malay> witness <malay>kita nya</malay> own singapore police <malay>buat gini</malay> confirm <malay>kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap</malay>
ya
[ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
I think it <malay>memang</malay> exist [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
(err)
rules applied in our countries so that we we know how to
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism [ah] it it will happen in all countries in all places and <malay>aku rasa</malay> that's why the government
are are very strict with these rules so if you can see in facebook or twitter
if you can see any people that get recorded for being racist
the police will come down as fast as they can and then really resolve the matter [ah]
but it's really but the offence is really high I heard that's why you can't be racist
<malay>tapi nak buat macam mana kalau</malay> government <malay>tak tekun dengan dia punya</malay> laws <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>tak tak</malay> really [ah]
be serious about this then <malay>aku rasa kita nya</malay> country
will be like other countries [ah] I mean let's just look at our neighbour [ah] malaysia <malay>kau tahu</malay> malaysia <malay>sendiri kalau</malay>
okay <malay>aku sendiri melayu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku tak nak cakap</malay>
<malay>tapi aku rasa</malay> the malay rights over there it's
too overwhelming to a extent where it's
it's belittling the other races [ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa dari</malay> malaysia
so <malay>kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata</malay> [kan] <malay>aku cina</malay> [eh] <malay>abeh aku nak beli rumah aku</malay> malaysia citizen <malay>tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar</malay> extra <malay>mahal sebab aku cina</malay>
[eh] [a'ah] <malay>betul juga</malay> [eh]
speaking of which
it's also I think it's it's really the privileges [ah] [eh] in singapore but I think the privileges in malaysia and singapore is is different [ah]
ours is more like a soft privileges for the other race
and then for malaysia it's really the obvious privileges for the malays [ah]
but (um)
ya when you look at these malaysians [eh] they
despite all the privileges that they have especially the malays [kan] they they are quite complacent with
with the how
things are going on with the politics or how the government run the country
<malay>macam dorang tak bersyukur</malay> [eh] <malay>macam apa dorang dapat</malay>
that's what <malay>aku</malay> personally see [lah] or feel <malay>bila aku</malay> when <malay>aku tengok kat</malay> news
or
(err) videos on the internet what what <malay>kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak</malay>
but I think before they I mean they I I think when they want to become the minister they had good intentions but (uh)
but then ya [lah] you know
when they are when they have the power it's again it's all about the power you know the the greed they have all these then they
their intentions changed
they changed [ah] in terms of controlling
and then they you know they do all these kind of bad things [ah] which doesn't really [ah] help the citizens so I think they they have lost their paths the correct paths
and it's sad to see [ah] <malay>tapi aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa</malay> #najib# <malay>dia dia dah kena tangkap</malay> [kan] <malay>aku dengar dia dapat</malay> confirm he's <malay>dia dah</malay> found guilty [kan]
ya (mm)
[eh] I I actually agree [seh] cause [ah] when I when I watch [ah] the parliaments in malaysia [eh]
actually quite #jialat# [eh] like they the way they is not really ethical and it's just very chaotic inside the
the room that they are having
and then I'm pretty sure there's (err) a person in-charge [kan] to control how the situation is like when you know the arguments get escalated
or when they have their points viewed ya they want to really you know press the other people then they should really have a someone to control [ah] to make to make sure that the thing is in control but then
it's just so chaotic <malay>macam tak ada orang</malay> control [seh] <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah</malay> parliament <malay>lain</malay>
ya speaking of which (err) I I got saw this one video
where all the malaysia parliaments
he
he can't even in proper english which I think that should be one of the basic (uh)
basic (err)
[ah] basic skills to perform when you are presenting to the other people from other countries [kan] cause you are representing you're representing your country [what]
then he cannot even speak
english
simple english perhaps
it's it's it's if if if you found it the the video on youtube I think you will laugh [ah] which to me I find it very very [ah] interesting cause how can someone
(err) who is representing his country coming from the parliament cannot even speak proper english
how do they decide on who should be the in-charge
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what <malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>boleh dorang ada orang macam gini</malay> to represent [eh]
(mm) <malay>aku pun nampak ni dekat</malay> facebook or youtube [ah]
but [ah] I think it's on twitter <malay>tapi</malay> how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
to take the degree for you or you fake a degree and not get caught by it
I think (uh) it's a lot of mysteries happening in malaysia [eh] you can get away with all these things
(um)
but <malay>aku aku</malay> really wonder how
how the malaysians are handling their
their their their
[ah] recruitment and the position that is of power [ah] <malay>macam ni semua</malay> position important important [seh] <malay>abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh</malay> just get away with all these things
<malay>tapi</malay>
if you were given a choice [eh] <malay>kau</malay> will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
(mm)
[ah] that's true [eh] I I I been to malaysia a couple of times for leisure purposes [lah] [eh] but I really like despite how I I really admire my country
and how they govern the country with the rules and the laws but I just feel that
I don't know [eh] I feel like if I were to live in malaysia I'll be more happier in a sense [ah] but speaking of I mean in regards to your question [ah] [kan]
the money money wise I think what I would do <malay>aku</malay> would probably <malay>kerja kat</malay> singapore
<malay>tapi</malay> (um)
<malay>tapi aku</malay> would live there so <malay>aku</malay> can know have a lot of make a lot of more money [ah] <malay>abeh aku boleh</malay> spend
spend more things over there as compared to singapore you can't really spend that much you have to pay the bills and everything [kan] so
it's not that (err)
ya I I probably will work in singapore and then I would live in malaysia
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [eh] that's true [eh] <malay>aku rasa</malay> I mean
it takes a lot of risk I mean I would say there's a small sacrifice [ah] and then probably (err) you know
get a holiday or something to really enjoy if I really want to you know
to enjoy my holidays [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position [ah] which you have to climb eventually
so [ah] I I think there's risk if you're living in singapore or malaysia
so I mean I will see how it goes [ah] I really don't know how to go about this
but definitely
having to live in singapore and been to malaysia before I really think I would suit
living in malaysia [ah] cause I think the lifestyle there is much more peaceful and much more fun
just feel that if I were to live in malaysia I can do a lot more things
especially when you have the money [ah]
(mm)
<malay>aku rasa</malay> it's all about
(um) how you upgrade yourself [lah] as a person
and if you really
have a good job
and have a good career
or you can do a lot of things [ah] doesn't mean you have to live in malaysia to live happily
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever <malay>tapi</malay>
ya I think these these these things is really about I think in singapore and malaysia also about education [ah] or anywhere else in other countries
as long as you have good education have a good job then you will live a happier life
(err) ya it's tough [ah] but I think overall still again it's all about balance [ah] if you study and work hard and doesn't really care about yourself you will eventually you know don't don't live happily [ah] which which is not the goal that you would want to pursue I guess
[ah] currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can (uh) I think it's more important for me to focus on myself [ah] [sia] I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend <malay>abeh aku tak boleh</malay> sustain <malay>mata air aku</malay>
then <malay>teruk</malay> [ah] <malay>puas hati aku ada banyak duit</malay> then <malay>aku boleh ada</malay> girlfriend then <malay>aku boleh</malay> you know
<malay>kita dua-dua boleh</malay> enjoy
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah]
then what <malay>kau kau ada mata air</malay>
serious [ah]
I I think it's (uh) I don't know how how to say this but
maybe we we we have seen the wrong side of the internet
know we we may not <malay>kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga</malay>
we just see what cause if you realise
these are the people who want attention so they will post this kind of things and then we cause we live on the social media a lot so we tend to think that this is the trend but maybe
people who are happily in the relationship together they <malay>dorang macam</malay> relax [jer] <malay>tak</malay> post <malay>apa-apa</malay> just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily [ah]
to <malay>tengok orang macam gini semua</malay> [kan] I think <malay>ada segelintir</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dorang macam rasa</malay> the same thing <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>golongan yang</malay> you know (uh) having good relationships [ah] so <malay>aku rasa kau</malay> should give a try <malay>tapi ye</malay> [lah] likewise you know <malay>aku rasa sekarang tengah susah</malay> [kan] so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay>
(mm) ya true I I think as a man we should lead
we should we should show that we are
we are the ones who are able to provide
and then not the ones who
to to seek help to I mean I'm I'm not saying in the sense that we we all should
should really [ah]
I mean I I I understand that some people some (um)
relationships they work equally I know they both hustle and they both help each other despite
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever <malay>tapi</malay>
I think as a man we should be the ones who
to represent [ah] the relationship and should provide and to make sure that we are the ones
are there emotionally financially for our partner [ah]
we can't rely too much on our partner cause I don't know I think this is a culture that has been set
for my race but <malay>entah aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap</malay>
you know <malay>tunjuk yang kita boleh</malay> lead <malay>anak orang betul tak</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> no choice [ah] this is how
we (uh) most parents are dealing with their child cause <malay>kita pun nak kena</malay> survive [pe] <malay>nak cari duit</malay> it's all about money [ah] singapore is all about being financially stable [ah] and that sacrifice have to be made [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak</malay>
legit you want to see your son being fed and you want to pay the bills you have to work [ah] you have to sacrifice that small portion
for your child for that love in order for them to grow [ah]
I think you have to find ways on how you can make do
all the missing time that you have (uh) have with your child [ah]
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> that's why some cultures they
they
they have they they have maids to take their child
<malay>abeh</malay> (uh)
<malay>abeh macam</malay> (uh)
for some other other races they maybe they ask the grandparents to
to take care of the child so there's a bit of the bond family bond there [lah] I guess
but ya I think it that that part it's it's it's it's sad [lah] but we have no choice [lah] we are living in a country where
money is our priority [ah] over love [ah]
unless I think rare cases where you are living and you're having a good career
a good paying job
at the same time you can meet your
you can have the bond with your child with your son or daughters
but then again it's all about really the the time [ah] you have to make sacrifices [ah]
<malay>dah terpaksa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah</malay> so
we have to make do with what we can [ah] no choice
that's why <malay>aku rasa</malay> financial planning is very important <malay>kita kena</malay> plan <malay>sekarang</malay> before having a kid you know not just funfair <malay>buat lepas tu</malay> at last <malay>kita susah</malay> then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable <malay>cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu</malay>
so really [ah] it's really about upgrading ourselves make sure you you have proper planning
and make sure you can provide [ah]
(uh) both partners know what to do both partners know what are their responsibilities
and then we can grow
and to have a beautiful family [ah] <malay>tu aku rasa</malay> [ah] (um) yup
on your end <malay>kau rasa apa</malay>
it's all priorities [ah] [eh]
okay bro
alright
alright bro see you around bro

[oh]
ya actually that [one] [sia] the
(uh) what work (uh) work from home and like all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard [lah] because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
<malay>susah sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> call call <malay>cikgu cikgu ini semua</malay> like
<malay>leceh</malay>
more like like usually you know when you go to the class then you like <malay>kenal</malay> all the <malay>muka muka</malay> of all the <malay>cikgu</malay>
then you can
<malay>macam berbual berbual sikit</malay>
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like [what] or they use Zoom [ah]
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward [ah] because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
ya it's like it's like you <malay>berbual</malay> with like some
<malay>orang yang tak kenal</malay> [kan] then <malay>susah nak berbual</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> like
you don't know the name don't even know their

ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister #irman#
that teacher
then after that like (uh) I because he got too many students then after that everytime I ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his his (uh) attitude [ah] he's like he would prefer to like (uh) (uh) give his attention to those who are better you know
he want to keep the A students A then after that like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> he
<malay>selepas itu diam diam</malay> I was like ignore [ah]
<malay>dia macam tak suka layan</malay> my my artworks then he <malay>tak nak</malay> really <malay>tolong</malay>

for O level art I think I I wanted to do like some [oh] remember me <malay>beli</malay> the right then after that like I take pictures of the <malay>dia keras</malay>
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like (uh)
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
no because it showed like <malay>macam</malay> the perspective of how a small person just as a big person would be
(um)
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
(uh) what [ah] it became like
I just did a photoshop [lah] of people like climbing onto the that was very old

and then below the bed
below the bed

so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene [lah] so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya [eh] I remember you were doing also [ah] but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
[oh] my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the
it's very hard to use your focus on your and your studies at the same time
ya
then like I also like <malay>jumpa</malay> a lot of <malay>pak cik</malay>
the <malay>selalu kata</malay> to me [ah] like
(uh)
<malay>selepas sekolah selalu</malay> just <malay>pergi</malay>
trail
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like

the trail then <malay>selepas itu</malay> from the trail <malay>pergi rumah tak sampai satu jam pon</malay>
<malay>selepas sekolah</malay> but then like
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic [kan]
I <malay>tak rasa</malay> like can <malay>boleh boleh buat benda mcam gini</malay> [ah] because <malay>nanti terlalu penat</malay> [ah] <malay>selepas selepas sekolah</malay> [dah] <malay>penat</malay> then <malay>selepas itu nak pergi</malay> cycle <malay>selepas</malay> <malay>selepas kayuh kayuh kayuh</malay> [dah] <malay>lagi penat</malay>
then <malay>selepas itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>hari hari selpas itu masih kena pergi sekolah juga</malay>
<malay>semakin penat</malay> [seh]
like that <malay>salah buat</malay>
ya
just <malay>penat</malay>
tired
even in english also I can say like tired [lah]
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me [ah] in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
like still <malay>masih tak</malay> [tau] [ah] <malay>ada rasa macam nak masuk jadi orang</malay> army [kan]
<malay>tapi selepas itu</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> [ah] <malay>takut kena dapat kerja merepek</malay> [ah]
it's
I don't know [ah] people here people always say [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if sign on [oh] later you
you <malay>kena</malay> you will <malay>kena banyak banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>nanti tak tak</malay> enjoy you know
ya
but
but sadly <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like engineering
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army [ah] even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because #sui sui# in engineering
(mm) got chemical engineering
[oh] my god <malay>tapi</malay> ya earn and learn <malay>itu sekarang banyak orang tengah</malay> apply
my mum also <malay>kata</malay> like <malay>macam nak ambil juga</malay> [ah] it's like <malay>boleh</malay> upgrade skills but at the same time <malay>boleh belajar</malay> [eh] no <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>kerja</malay> and then and earn <malay>duit</malay>
you know
[ah]
[a'ah] <malay>gaji dia tak seberapa tapi</malay> it's
<malay>lebih bagus daripada tak ada apa apa terus</malay>
[ah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> nowadays also
<malay>banyak orang tengah hilang kerja</malay>
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you [oh] we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
L <malay>banyak orang kena pecat</malay> so quite <malay>sedih</malay> though
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
ya it's like quite sad like I know singaporeans like <malay>gaji</malay>
<malay>banyak juga</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like
<malay>tak seberapa</malay> [pe] like
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like [what] five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst [one] is the people who who already have high pay [lah] because their
their lifestyle is already like (uh) I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> like if Tiba Tiba the [oh] <malay>gaji potong</malay> then like their lifestyle is still the same you know
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard [lah]
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
[eh] why gym close [ah] cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
ya <malay>rumah dia orang terlalu kecik</malay> [ah] then also <malay>tak boleh</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan]
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> even if <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> work out <malay>kat rumah nanti mak dia orang kacau</malay> or like <malay>adik beradik kacau</malay>
[oh] my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
they were like showing like <malay>macam</malay> a got these people they were doing like Zoom workouts
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was originally like a
(uh)
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase [ah] then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good [ah] because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay [ah] obviously there's some limitations [ah]
but
ya he went to the extent
no [ah] because his house was too small like he he he showed (uh) showed the
like programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
so like <malay>selepas itu</malay> he just <malay>buat kat tangga</malay> [ah] <malay>kat tangga lebih banyak ruang</malay> [pe]
ya
then <malay>selepas itu</malay> also got the malay dance group
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
so basically they just individually <malay>semua</malay> like <malay>joget kat depan</malay> camera
savage love ya I don't know but then like
but then like they just <malay>joget</malay> at the camera individually but then like they did like their own solo part then there
it's quite cool [ah] because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun [ah]
you just open up the game that [one] [ah] <malay>yang ada</malay> Minecraft that [one] then you farm farm <malay>kat dalam</malay> game
<malay>sama juga</malay> [pe] like you
<malay>berkebun</malay>
[oh] my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren #tan# that [one] or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like [eh] you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside [ah] like what if what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable [sia] but I like the concept
ya <malay>tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>makan sayur rasa macam rumput gitu</malay> like
to me to to me like <malay>sayur semua rasa sama</malay>
it's like
<malay>but rasanya macam bila gigit daun</malay> then <malay>keluar air</malay>
<malay>rasa dia semua sama tak pernah tukar</malay> even <malay>kalau ada sambal</malay> [kan] <malay>sambalnya</malay> just <malay>tutup dia punya air</malay> like when I <malay>gigit</malay> into the <malay>sayur</malay> right <malay>masih rasa</malay> [eh] <malay>ini macam sayur macam daun keluar air</malay> then <malay>ada sambal itu</malay> [jer]
<malay>tak pernah rasa lain</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi sayur bagus untuk kesihatan</malay>
<malay>tak nak tak nak</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur</malay>
<malay>tak suka sayur tapi suka</malay> earth so <malay>mesti</malay>
so must (uh) <malay>buat</malay> hydroponic <malay>gitu [lah]</malay>
yes
ya
and eating all the <malay>kambing</malay> the <malay>kambing semua makan rumput</malay> [kan]
<malay>rumput buat</malay> oxygen
<malay>saya makan kambing semua untuk</malay> save the earth
ya <malay>lebih rumput</malay> you know
(mm) but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
[oh] my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during [eh] during primary school
(um)
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like (uh) they showed (uh) around [lah] like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube [kan]
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
then <malay>macam</malay> very cool [lah] then <malay>selepas itu</malay> [kan]
I <malay>menang</malay> something
because <malay>dia orang buat macam ada kecil punya</malay> competition [ah] <malay>untuk macam bagi budak budak</malay> chance <malay>bawa balik benda</malay>
then after that I <malay>menang</malay>
I <malay>menang</malay> like a small <malay>pokok</malay> Ribena
ya
I think same thing like grape [ah] <malay>dia</malay> like mash mash mash
then after that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> just <malay>kumpul</malay> together then <malay>buat macam</malay> syrup
[a'ah]
ya
ya I think the moment they like boil and then after that they make <malay>macam</malay> like concentrate
then <malay>selepas itu dia orang campur dengan air</malay> syrup <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk buat yang kita</malay> buy <malay>itu</malay>
more thick
like more <malay>pekat</malay> [ah] I think I think confirm got like got like sugar inside like sugar syrup
to make it more thick
but ya then after that I I won the <malay>pokok</malay>
no <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>tanya</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) they just ask about the facts on the <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] like the hydroponic or like how how like I forgot [what] [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything [ah]
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant [ah] I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like (uh)
actually I saw this one whole circuit
[oh] like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
ya [lah] because obviously like the plants <malay>pon</malay> constantly be like (uh) consuming
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenhouse effect [ah]
ya question [ah]
[oh] my god
bicycle
excursion [ah]
their did mature more environment friendly too
unknown doesn't put like mature discipline implements
[oh] my god ya you know they they estimate the island to be like filled up by like I think twenty forty or something like not even that far away [sia]
ya we'll be fourty then like also like [eh] [oh] my god [eh] #ti# you know what's the best way to make singaporeans like not use plastic bags
where
make them pay for your plastic bags
because singaporeans don't like to pay extra for anything
you just stand [oh] the plastic bags extra twenty cents
you know like nowadays at supermarket right they always do like the
(uh) if you never bring your own bag you pay ten cent for each plastic bag that they use
ya

you talking to someone <malay>yang belajar</malay> photoshop so why you saying that guy that way
ya but it's time consuming like I said again I just want to take picture I want to edit straight away on my phone and straight away post that is me I like the easy way the nicest an easy way that's it
okay but if for you your [one] is professional like as in like yours is
you want to (uh) what promote whatever you are doing okay whatever that you are doing
body body shop
body builder thingy or you want to be a fitness trainer so you need to sell it to them so you want to use your photoshop go ahead photoshop
what is going to me [ah] I can't wait I'm left with like one more year old man I can away
[kan] technically not one more year [oh] ya one more year ya ya ya november next month
<malay>lagi sepuluh bulan</malay>
what is
what
(mmhmm)
so the last two months of your you can leave the camp everyday
while basically you guys will be cleaners for the last months
<malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang sapu-sapu mop-mop</malay>
<malay>yang mop</malay> canteen <malay>mop</malay> canteen
why
you know what reminds me of my <malay>sekolah</malay> time sunrise sunrise sunrise [kan] [a'ah] sunrise
sunrise ya we have to clean we have to
yes you have to clean after every practical after every practical
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well (um) <malay>sapu</malay>
<malay>lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci</malay> all the pan pots all wash
it make sure it's clean make sure it's clean and dry then make sure once the chef comes back he touch the table and there's
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then <malay>jap</malay> when you <malay>cakap macam gitu teringat macam</malay> [oh] okay <malay>macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu</malay>
but we only clean the inside of the classes which is quite big [lah] because is a kitchen what is a kitchen so it's quite big
what do you mean (ugh) !huh! it's a horrible mess man
ya is it no his
the the worst part is when
the flour is like flying a [lah]
wait [ah]
the flour is around the floor
is what
meaning
always always like dirty up nursing and will everyone have this (err) what apparently apparently
no my class didn't had any emperor
(mm) (mm) no it's just that we love a certain parts let's say some of us do not like to mop some of us do not like to watch them on him what's and bends south as doesn't like
know the rubbish bin all that right (err) so <malay>kita</malay> again [ah] upper aside those ya not so basically we will most of the time we will ask like
(um) everyday we have our own leader you know everyday we have you know like if if if <malay>apa ni</malay> primary school <malay>ke</malay> secondary school prefect prefect secondary school
[eh] secondary <malay>pun ada</malay> [eh]
so like prefect [kan] <malay>macam</malay> everyday <malay>kita ada</malay> prefect <malay>dekat sekolah tu walaupun</malay> it's already a a
ya even though it's already a college we have a prefect everyday so
is a monitor so no this monitor job right everyday is a different person is a different person everyday
<malay>ikut dia punya</malay> register number something like that so it's not loser basically this person do right is like everyday <malay>dia akan</malay> assign like
(uh) okay today [ah]
we going to learn this and this and this and after the class today right now [ah]
okay the four of you will do the pots and pans the four of you will mop the four of you will do this <malay>ataupun</malay> okay the four of you will collect the ingredients the flour and put on top okay the four of you
will do this thing this thing this thing so that's what the monitor everyday does it we call it I'm not wrong we call that
there's a term for that we don't call monitor or president other term other term I <malay>lupa apa</malay> chef <malay>entah apa</malay> chef I <malay>lupa</malay> but I hate it when it comes to my turn
no I'm not I'm the most <malay>macam</malay> no (um) the most shy because like in the morning I have to be talking to all of them like as if like I'm the leader [sia] I have to talk like okay I'm the leader you guys have to listen to me I'm not that kind of person [what] I'm not
so <malay>macam bila</malay> part I [jer] <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> [ah] everytime is my turn I will be like [ah] shit I'm so scared I'm so scared I will get like anxiety <malay>macam</malay>
panic (uh) <malay>macam mana macam mana</malay> but the <malay>hal</malay> is everytime <malay>dah dapat</malay> [tau] everytime <malay>dah dapat</malay> because it rotates [what]
why [ah]
(mmhmm)
no okay but see that's the different for you you got their position because you really wanna do you really want to have their position
you wanted that position
see
see basically you wanted to lead something right
okay
but you okay I'm talking about the lead part okay not talking about the pay
so that's the difference like I do not want to lead
even if I don't want to lead then I'll be like <malay>macam</malay> on [lah] very on very #kiasu# you know
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>macam ini macam tak ada pilihan langsung</malay> everyday <malay>orang</malay> rotate <malay>orang yang ada yang lagi pemalu daripada</malay> I
<malay>yang</malay> very shy super timid <malay>ada</malay> that [one] also like
good morning good morning
(um) ya but then
but that we as a as the <malay>dia punya</malay> classmate <malay>tak ada macam</malay>
!wah! this [one] !wah! <malay>rabak</malay> [sia] cannot [sia] cannot [sia] we don't <malay>kita akan macam</malay>
for for example [lah] <malay>nama dia</malay> michelle [eh] michelle we would encourage her would be <malay>macam</malay> michelle it's okay you tell me what you want me to do you tell me I sitting beside you you tell me
[oh] okay okay okay okay now next person go
ya time <malay>sekolah</malay> that's why I really love at sunrise you know at sunrise it's like the most amazing school I mean okay maybe the school is not really amazing <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> classmate is the most amazing classmate ever so I <malay>macam</malay> happy <malay>gila</malay>
time secondary school primary school <malay>jangan cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>paling merepek</malay>
!huh! okay part <malay>buli</malay> in singapore is not that <malay>rabak</malay> (hmm) <malay>kalau buli</malay> in malaysia is the most <malay>rabak</malay> [eh]
because even though like (um)
and then
okay [lah] let him be [lah] okay I don't know what happen to him now it's been years already hopefully okay <malay>dah berubah</malay>
which one which one
[oh] is it I have two
ya
I still feel so stupid you know I'm like I'm I'm staying at #choa chu kang# <malay>tapi asal</malay> I <malay>jauh</malay>
balance it at #ang mo kio# I feel so stupid
what
that's why I say I feel so stupid
yes ya I agree you are welcome no because back then
I was like okay because I wanted to be a nurse you see everything so I want [ah]
this those or that
ya nurse at see me so I apply see me I didn't get then after somewhere else at bally's
I apply something at balestier I do not know why got the other one at balestier and then suddenly balestier <malay>ni pindah</malay> for the second year <malay>pergi dekat yang</malay> college central
the school is horrible [sia] so so big like super big like if your class is at
<malay>hujung sekali kalau kelas</malay> you <malay>hujung sekali</malay> your canteen is <malay>hujung sini</malay>
that's it your break time lunch time that's it you got no space to eat everytime everyone come ready sit ready got no space
but at least you have a recognise diploma
(mm)
but one thing that I find
(um) very sad [lah] about my life is that I have diploma but it doesn't work
basically it's useless which
to my defense I didn't know <malay>sebab bila</malay> I (uh) <malay>apa</malay> apply for this <malay>sekolah dia orang cakap</malay> [oh] this diploma is recognisable everywhere in singapore outside of singapore is recognisable !wah! but when apply <malay>kerja</malay> horrible
no they do not recognise [ah] <malay>apa</malay> private diploma singapore don't recognise private diploma even <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> I <malay>yang kerja</malay>
[eh] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang apa yang</malay> M <malay>yang macam</malay> you know is private <malay>juga</malay> [kan] <malay>ataupun apa</malay>
P B S [eh]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] that [one] private also [kan] that [one] also not recognise [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> private
<malay>tapi</malay> is like quite the amount is so much for a private but then end up you don't use my for you you <malay>korang bagi kerja korang tak nak</malay> accept
no sound about that can you can you try to understand but it's not about that it it just
it's not about that I'm talking about why singapore do not accept private diploma
okay if you want to use on me okay if you want to use on me I apply for jobs using my why they don't accept me use something can use something
my is social media and web development I have photoshop I know I know coding I can get amazing jobs
yes
exactly so you cannot give me that kind of answer if you don't know the answer
<malay>takde</malay> [lah]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] culinary job is I understand
I understand is (err)
my private diploma is only to get culinary jobs
because my private diploma is culinary
so I understand that part is like <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] but then
I still do study to get my diploma
okay but then that [one] [ah] you know what you forget about it you let me use my NITEC so I been applying for NITEC
from NITEC
so now you are saying like okay you do not know what is happening okay so I <malay>bilang</malay>
basically !alah! <malay>macam banyak</malay> job <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] <malay>orang yang tak ada kerja</malay> but I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] maybe I'm looking at the wrong places <malay>mungkin</malay> my agents are not really good
no ya that's why like most of them <malay>macam</malay> I wanna leave singapore I don't want to stay at singapore or something but to live at singapore you need job honey
to get money
<malay>maksudnya</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
[a'ah] like <malay>dia cepat-cepat sangat dia</malay> progress
no [lah] I mean I am grateful right (err) singapore progress fast
[ah] I'm grateful that we <malay>jadi ita tak ke belakang</malay> [tau] <malay>jadi kita tak ada</malay> slow
okay I'm grateful for that (um) ya you know some of our neighbouring country is like that
okay so so I'm ungrateful for singapore being too (um) being able to progress very fast and so like the younger generation like us or our
future kids you know future grandchildren you know <malay>dia orang akan dapat macam</malay> a lot of privileges [lah] and then same time <malay>makan maju lagi cepat dari kita lagi</malay>
<malay>pintar pintar</malay> [eh] !wow! <malay>bahasa melayu pintar</malay> is <malay>pintar</malay> is <malay>pandai</malay> [lah] ya I don't know <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>nak pakai</malay> [lah] <malay>ni pandai</malay> okay <malay>pandai tapi</malay>
ya but I'm seriously like grateful [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> singapore <malay>macam</malay> very multiracial multiracial and then <malay>macam</malay> we don't we don't really have like racial discrimination amongst the
all of us [tau] we do but we don't really have so it's like
thank god
you know thank god okay so okay [lah] singapore is okay [lah] I would say okay
ya
for me singapore job is [ah] ya ya a bit difficult for me to get singapore job <malay>sebab kena banyak</malay> mandarin mandarin <malay>kena banyak berbual</malay> mandarin then <malay>macam</malay>

hello <malay>mas apa khabar</malay>
I'm fine thank you
how's your family
[ah]
ya second one is a boy right
[oh] I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
it's okay <malay>macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana</malay> (mm) so what are your plans for this weekend
[oh]
(uh) I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it (um) you might know them because some of them are our former [ah] schoolmates
[oh] yes #ahmad# is there (uh) <malay>dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada</malay> (uh) think four or five kids
no [lah] it's okay [ah] <malay>rezeki masing-masing</malay> [ah] so are you not going out with your family today
[oh] you're into baking now !wah! that's nice !wah! must try some of your cake soon [ah]
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
[ah] movie but [ah] during this pandemic kind of hard [lah] because I think with the crowd control and all
!wah! netflix and chill [ah]
(err) I don't know (uh) only so far only a few have confirmed but (uh)
I will update you [ah] on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can [lah] (uh)
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
[ah]
(um) but is it too young for them to start
(um) going to tuition at this age she's only six years old [kan]
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that (err) everyone is competing (uh) so
it's
it has its pros and cons [ah] like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
like <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
ya but
slowly [lah] but surely (uh) I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important [lah] they just try their best [lah]
and
I I do have other maybe (uh) I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
[oh] [oh]
[orh] okay okay I understand I can ask for you [lah] then
(err) we'll see what we can arrange
(err)
!wah! you sit down at coffeeshop [ah] I thought you #atas# [one]
[oh] you you full time housewife [ah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tu boleh jaga anak-anak</malay>
good [lah]
actually it's better for to me [lah] personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
(um) like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore (err) I think (err)
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive [ah] then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day (uh) some owners also like abuse their maid [lah] so that's not right [lah] I feel
ya there's (uh) the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse [ah] think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news [lah] but you just have to be updated [lah] now with the
COVID nineteen [ah] I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that [lah] before they are cleared to do cleaning [oh] (mm)
<malay>bagus</malay> [seh] <malay>masak untuk</malay> husband all
[oh] must take care of your health now [lah]
like but I think if now if you go to any
(uh) I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya [lah] for those who are working [lah] they will give you like
to check on yourself
(err) so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ya but <malay>ni adalah satu</malay> (uh) precaution for us to take ya so <malay>kita perlu berhati-hati</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so <malay>penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah</malay> [jer]
(uh) #alhamdulilah# so far
I'm okay [lah] maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest (uh) because of work [ah]
ya [lah] stress [lah] at work <malay>macam-macam</malay>
(um) politic [lah] then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what (uh)
safety measure measurement at work (mm) cause yes
now currently we have this installation (uh) of #doraemon# at the national museum it's interesting [lah] but
since it's the holidays [kan] <malay>banyak orang-orang datang</malay> (uh) visit museum
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak datang dengan</malay> family <malay>nak kena datang</malay> on weekdays
(uh) weekend <malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal terlalu ramai</malay>
(uh) until <malay>nak</malay> queue under the hot sun <malay>pengsan pula</malay>
(um) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>semua kena</malay> queue <malay>macam biasa</malay>
unless I'm there [lah] then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ya so ya [lah] kind of sad <malay>pasal tengah</malay> holiday <malay>sekarang</malay> but we have nowhere to go
[ah]
[oh] ya ya I've read about it but <malay>belum ada</malay> time [lah] to redeem tour voucher
(uh)
[oh] I don't think <malay>ada</malay>
for kids <malay>ada tu</malay> vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
(uh) claim it
online [ah] so it's not that bad [lah] hundred dollars <malay>pun jadi</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>biasa</malay> [lah] singaporean <malay>bila yang dia orang tak</malay> complain
[oh] usually you go to #johor# [ah] and do your shopping
(mm) understand ya I think (uh) COVID nineteen <malay>ni menjejas banyak</malay> singaporean
then ya [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday <malay>pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu</malay> [lah]
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so <malay>pasal</malay> I think malaysia <malay>pun sekarang masih ada banyak</malay> case [ah] so it's still unstable [lah]
I think so far our government has done well [lah] to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
(mm)
[oh]
I think (uh) ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also <malay>ada bilang juga</malay>
[ah] so it's like
(uh) they have different sizes [lah] and
(uh) they cater also for kids
(mm)
[ah] no [lah] I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask <malay>pun</malay> can do its job [lah]
(mm)
ya true
ya [lah] <malay>sekarang pun yang baru-baru</malay> case <malay>dekat</malay> tampines mall <malay>tu</malay> !wah!
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall <malay>terperanjat</malay> [seh]
ya
ya but surprisingly
(uh) so far <malay>tak ada pula</malay> case <malay>yang lain-lain</malay>
I mean <malay>yang</malay> in the community [lah]
I think they are currently
preparing [ah] for phase three to roll out but ya [lah] depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert [lah] it's important [lah] for us to be on alert
[ah] because you will never know [seh] who <malay>yang ada penyakit ni</malay> then <malay>kita pun senang jangkit</malay> especially <malay>dengan macam</malay>
<malay>warga emas dengan kita punya</malay> parents <malay>nak kena jaga-jaga</malay>
ya I think <malay>baru semalam</malay> news (uh) that people are queuing over at <malay>mana</malay> [eh]
[ah] foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
in place [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] from the look of the photos <malay>tak ada</malay> [jer] think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
(mm)
ya [lah] that's where the christmas light up is <malay>lagi</malay> so this year has been a challenging year [lah] [ah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
<malay>ada bagus juga</malay> [lah] that you
<malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to <malay>ke</malay> malaysia <malay>ke</malay> I think it's affecting business everywhere (uh) <malay>kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian</malay> [kan]
I think (mm) <malay>mana-mana</malay> affected
you know
(mm) ya [lah] but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> are required to have the mandatory swab test then (uh) like
stay home notice ya
and I think (uh) for those who are coming in I think
(uh) they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure [ah] I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required [lah] [eh] even when they come in they have to do the swab test [lah]
[ah]
ya thankfully
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] so I I <malay>dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena</malay> swab test <malay>yang</malay>
(uh) <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau dibuat dengan betul tak</malay> [lah] <malay>rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru</malay> or trainee <malay>yang buat</malay> !wah! <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali</malay>
a
(mm) yes yes
(uh) I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the (uh) the conduct the test
ya I think I even my friend <malay>yang</malay>
was (mm) asked to leave I think he got a job as a security [lah] (err) and considered is also a high risk because (err) he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm (uh)
but actually they're paying quite
high [lah] is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that [lah] because they don't want to
be in contact [ah] ya don't want to be exposed to this (uh) and even when he he's finished his job think he ask (uh) his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can (uh) remove his clothes outside his house (uh) ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace [lah] so it's just an
additional steps [ah] precaution ya
[ah]
ya you see
ya actually quite <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] in this situation <malay>macam banyak orang ada</malay> family but
<malay>kena berhenti kerja</malay> business <malay>tutup</malay>
[ah] so it's not easy [ah] it's quite
twenty twenty has been (uh) ya [lah] like I said a challenge [lah] <malay>untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan</malay> [lah]
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
measure steps [ah] I think which is quite good [lah] for all [lah] even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted <malay>tak boleh keluar ke apa</malay> but still it's for our own good [lah]
[oh] I do actually (err) I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like [ah] so he and his wife <malay>dah beli</malay>
a few cartons [eh] I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe [lah]
got some quality is not that good [ah]
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask [ah]
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but I don't know how <malay>berapa bagus yang</malay> reusable <malay>punya</malay> mask
ya but
no [lah] I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last [lah] (err) for a few months then but you have to
wash [lah] I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] because (uh)
<malay>bulan</malay> december (err) think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe <malay>nak ajak makan</malay> [lah] but
(err) according to the
safety measurement I think
!wah! only can <malay>keluar</malay> (um) five <malay>lima orang sahaja</malay>
(mm)
ya can okay [lah] that's an idea but
think <malay>kalau</malay> the atmosphere is different [lah] when you dining outside (err) <malay>dengan makan kat rumah</malay> [kan]
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
take care of ourselves [lah] think the celebration is is actually <malay>pasal kita nak kena</malay>
<malay>jaga diri sendiri</malay>
<malay>janji kita sihat</malay>
(mm) <malay>mana kita berhenti tadi</malay>
(um) [ah] <malay>awak</malay>
<malay>seorang</malay> baker <malay>awak suka masak apa</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> family
(mm)
<malay>pandai juga awak</malay> baking [eh] <malay>abeh kalau masak masak apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>untuk</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>suami awak</malay> family <malay>awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay>
(mm) <malay>mungkin pasal orang dah</malay> stock up <malay>ke</malay> (uh) <malay>iya</malay> [lah] singaporean [kan] <malay>macam saya cakap</malay> #kiasu# <malay>dia orang suka benar simpan</malay>
[oh] <malay>beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi</malay> (uh) three or four packets for a family of
[ah] three [kan] (mm)
ya [lah] <malay>kesian yang orang-orang yang ya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada pendapatan</malay> (mm) <malay>tapi saya rasa</malay> <malay>ada juga</malay> restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
(mm) ya [lah] <malay>saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah</malay> [lah] <malay>mana dia orang pergi</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay> (uh) there's a lot of platform <malay>yang</malay> go digital so I think (uh) everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop [ah] these are now necessities
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya I think (uh) a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can [lah] so it's best they do so [lah] during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected [seh] ya I think my friends either <malay>yang kena</malay> retrenched at an early age [eh]
feels also quite sad [lah] for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something [ah] but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad [lah] but it's better than not having no job and all [lah] ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya [lah]
ya [lah] it's tiring [lah] even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now (uh) doing grab but grab is also affected (err) think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he (uh) took back the car ya but still it's not doing well [lah] he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental (uh)
ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
I think <malay>dia tak akan</malay> take the swabber paying job [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I think he has more kids at home <malay>kesian takut</malay> he'll be affected [lah] even though he'll be (uh) think
he has his reasons [lah] for not doing that kind even though it's (uh) <malay>gaji tinggi</malay> but still <malay>dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan</malay> (uh)
to the family [lah]
(mm) true [lah] I think
the government implementing a lot of (err) help for those
need them [ah] they also I think they have set up this (um) united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need [lah] ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march [ah] I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya [lah] things will get better [lah] think I think for singaporean [ah] they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases [ah] that can affect us
ya where should we go to <malay>makan</malay> what is your favourite food
#prata#
(uh) there's a #prata# at #sin ming# I think it's quite nice it's run by a family (uh) father and a son
can can (um)
can [ah] maybe I want to try eat the #briyani# [ah]
the #briyani# is quite nice [ah] I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best [ah]
(err) what do you want to order I help you order
the #briyani# or the #prata# coin is also nice
yes the curry is (uh) <malay>sedap</malay>
and it's
<malay>tak pedas sangat</malay>
I think just the right
taste [ah]
can
(uh) I think I eat #briyani# with (uh) fried chicken [lah] (mm) because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking [ah]
then what drinks do you want
#teh# #peng# #teh# #peng#
#teh# with ice [eh]
ya but I think is not that good to always drink #teh# with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better [lah] at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health (err) and also see what eat we eat
[ah] and also see what we eat
okay
can
(uh)
anything else
!wah! there's a lot of people in the queue
ya
[ah] <malay>ada yang baik tu boleh juga pakai</malay> app <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>semua</malay>
digital
(uh) you order [lah] since you are very good using app
(um) #briyani# chicken
ya fried chicken
(mm)
[ah] yes
[oh] so we have to pick up or
[oh] okay [oh] that's
!wah! see <malay>sekarang semua dah</malay> high tech
order <malay>makan pun boleh</malay>
ya I understand but (err) I volunteered with (err) an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food (err) to buy groceries so that they will minimize (err) their movement outside [ah] so they can actually (err) contact us and have like medication
(uh) you can buy for them and then send it to their homes (um)
ya [lah] I think it's a long way to help our seniors (uh)
because I think if they are exposed to this I think (um) probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is (uh) I think done by government agencies [ah] they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors (uh) so that they will not be exposed much [ah] so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies [ah] then we will be there to send groceries medication (uh) food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer [lah] through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask [eh] for more information [lah] ya
ya at this point <malay>memang</malay> [ah] it's not
(um)
not right to be walking on their own <malay>tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> I think it will take <malay>masa yang panjang untuk dia orang</malay> to recover to get well [ah] <malay>kesian</malay> I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
free [ah]
(mm) <malay>betul tu abeh lagi</malay> cause my parents are staying on their own <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] we don't get to meet them as much <malay>abeh ada</malay> some old folks <malay>tak tahu pakai</malay> smartphone so <malay>lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu</malay> so <malay>kesian dia orang</malay> so <malay>masa-masa gini</malay> [lah] <malay>kita patut berwaspada</malay> even though it's sad but we have to follow [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] <malay>yang generasi yang</malay>
<malay>lama mereka tak</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> internet <malay>macam kita sekarang</malay> so with this technology I think <malay>dia orang</malay> will
[ah] <malay>ambil masa untuk</malay>
<malay>mempelajari semua abeh kalau kita</malay>
<malay>tak ada di sana</malay>
<malay>makin susah</malay>
so <malay>kesian</malay> so
communication
is
<malay>macam makin kurang</malay> and there's less interaction human interaction
ya [lah] <malay>tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia</malay> and <malay>dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh</malay>
<malay>nak dia orang bersama kita</malay>
(mm) actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones [lah] <malay>yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
data
(mm)
that's why it's (uh) important [lah] to <malay>untuk mereka</malay> (um) update <malay>dengan</malay> keep with the trend <malay>apa yang berlaku bukan jadi</malay> trendy [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> keep up with the times
<malay>mungkin juga</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga</malay> so <malay>mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat</malay>
(um) <malay>balik semula kehidupan yang</malay> normal
[oh] the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort [ah] to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal [ah]
some <malay>dan hari raya</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm) (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> contact is now minimal [lah] (mm)
<malay>sedih</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam mana</malay>
<malay>kita harus mengikut peraturan</malay>
<malay>mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan</malay> [lah] <malay>setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> singaporean usually <malay>kalau</malay> holiday <malay>akan</malay> go overseas (uh) (mm) holiday (uh) <malay>tapi sekarang tengah</malay>
<malay>keadaan begini semuanya</malay>
<malay>tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di</malay> singapore
ya [lah]
[oh] <malay>bagus tu</malay> idea staycation
<malay>boleh juga awak dan</malay> family destress
(mm) okay [lah] ya [lah] <malay>macam saya cakap ini adalah</malay>
the new normal <malay>yang kita akan lalui tak tahu berapa lama lagi</malay>
<malay>harap bersabar sahaja</malay> [lah] <malay>kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua</malay>
(mm)
ya think
when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide [lah]

(err) I booked for ten thirty class
for F forty five at #novena# shout out to F forty five #novena#
K (err) <malay>abeh lepas tu aku</malay> we attend (err) we attend the ten thirty class and then
we realise (err) like my friend <malay>pergi tanya</malay> the instructor [lah] then instructor said
the next lesson only got five people so we can join
so we joined the eleven thirty class also so
<malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>semua aku punya badan tengah</malay> ya back to back it's really very tiring
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> it's more of like
(err)
[eh] you know because it depends on days some days is different but (err) you (err) okay wait ya they let me
put it in words ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay> word
(err) cause it's recorded
I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
disclaimer it's just to okay I think maybe I should but it's just like you do work out then you rest then you do workout rest workout rest <malay>macam</malay> I think it's more it's like
#tabata# but not #tabata#
but there's a lot of variation in different different
[eh] <malay>macam</malay> like there's everyday there's a lot of different variation because everyday they focus on different things
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday I went to station four I did like a certain workout and then I went to station seven at the second lesson and then I did another set of workout which is totally different and then
ya that's why I I like really enjoy because like somemore with the environment everybody <malay>macam</malay> just doing their own <malay>apa ni</malay> doing their own workout ya and then the instructor
(err) just walk around and then <malay>dia kata</malay>
come on guys let's do it <malay>gitu aku macam tak</malay> it's it's more of like an australian accent
the pay ya
no she's not she's not she's not

I don't know but but at at least quite nice but when when when I was doing it [kan] the like <malay>dia cakap</malay> come on guys let's do it or something <malay>macam</malay> like along the lines and then she's like hydrate yourself and then <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay I I'm gonna keep pushing

!wow!
[ah] just saying it's recorded again
okay (um)
(um) [eh] but actually you know I was thinking [kan] actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line [kan]
like you know you want to make a movie <malay>ke nak</malay> make a television show
[kan] you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
I don't know whether they're doing it for I don't know whether they are doing it for your for your monday's one [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
it's quite cool mean meaning like <malay>macam kau</malay> imagine like currently you are just having normal conversation with a random stranger then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] you just like
<malay>menyeleweng</malay> it's not is it <malay>menyeleweng</malay> no <malay>menyeleweng</malay> is like out of topic [ah] you out of topic and then some times out of topic they can use that ideas to
(err)
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if [lah] I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting [lah]
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
or <malay>macam berbual merepek</malay>
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
<malay>macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>macam apa aku tengah berbual mana tahu</malay> this the idea of me thinking of this idea can be used as an idea for the show
ya
ya okay
<malay>merepek mungkin merepek satu jam dorang dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>apa ni tak ada</malay> idea <malay>langsung</malay> <malay>tu pasal tu pasal dia kata</malay> seventy to ninety [kan] <malay>dia kasi</malay> seventy [jer] <malay>kalau bagus gitu ni</malay> idea ninety
(hmm)
(mm)
seventy <malay>sana satu orang ke bukan</malay> [kan]
[ah] yes a bit <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> monday
<malay>satu orang</malay> seventy [oh] surveyor survey
[ah]
[ah]
okay
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tak faham</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
(mm) ya [ah]
[ah] okay I
(err)
saying it to the people listening to this (err) we are currently students and if you have any (err)
part
survey offers or any voice recording or any [oh] if you are thinking of doing a podcast [eh] you can actually <malay>ambil kesempatan</malay> [eh]
[ah]
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
how from talking about how's our day to (err) <malay>sekarang</malay> we asking for job okay [lah] sorry I was cutting you short
I was cutting you so
[oh] twenty seven more minutes
[eh] that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from [eh]
just gone
ya [eh] actually ya I forgot everything you know you know <malay>yang</malay> the last time <malay>kita buat</malay>
statistics [eh]
[eh] <malay>aku bagus gila</malay> [sia] I think like I can !chey!
[ah] P <malay>abeh lepas tu ada</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> data
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
(mm) I was quite good at it <malay>tapi</malay>
[eh] pure maths <malay>aku pun</malay> okay <malay>tapi tak tahu kenapa dapat</malay> B [oh] I miss out one question
I told cause I
(err) maybe bell curve also [lah]
cause I told my teacher [eh] I I skipped one question I don't know how to do <malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] once you skip one question you confirm can not get A
<malay>agaknya gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>agaknya dorang mark</malay> [eh] !oi!
!alamak! all correct but one question wrong <malay>sekali dua</malay> question <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>dua</malay> question
two mark question is wrong and then they sorry [ah] B but <malay>babi</malay>
no [lah] but actually is is is helpful for those that
(err) don't do well [eh] wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
like <malay>macam</malay> how do I say [ah]
actually it doesn't help [hor]
you just fail
[oh] ya actually he's true [ah]
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
<malay>macam</malay> normally you are just a fifty fifty fifty out of hundred student
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this [eh]
<malay>matlamat matlamat</malay>
<malay>maklumat</malay> information [ah]
no nobody can see your forehead
okay [ah] just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
(um)
maybe five metres
overhead [eh] no overhead bridge is four point eight metres [oh] four point five [ah]
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
[oh] you want to take
class three ya (err)
okay [lah]
[ah] I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips [ah]
<malay>boleh faham</malay> I take it there
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
our shit [oh] !oops! sorry for saying the S word <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh] I took my driving <malay>kat</malay>
that place let's call it (um)
[eh] I took my (err) I would say I took as school students so not private [lah]
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
(err)
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard (err) they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
just so that my group is with all the <malay>pakcik pakcik</malay> [ah] I cannot take it like okay there's a few <malay>yang</malay> like <malay>macam muda muda</malay>
but I would say the no [lah] not my age [lah]
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
I just pick the cheapest lesson [lah] so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
<malay>dia kata</malay>
(mm) you think you are correct or not
you think
(err) you think you correct (err) you should should drive faster you should <malay>gini gitu gitu gitu tapi aku macam</malay> dude I'm just learning and then if you're not gonna teach me or tell me why I am wrong
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
<malay>nak</malay>
ya some more I I was so pissed [lah] but then
I think at that point I was just still
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't I don't argue over !aiya! just <malay>sabar</malay> patience patience
yes
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] overall but overall I would say (err) cause I the last (err) I took my like (err) test like four times
so the first two times
(err) first two times I was bad in the circuit then I failed the third time I went out <malay>tapi</malay>
(err) it was last year twenty fourth december (err) because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
(err) my test and then
(err) it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
(err)
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
can I got eighteen points but then because of that one immediate failure I fail the whole test so I <malay>merajuk sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay>
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard #sharul# ya and then I heard #sharul# ya this year then I heard #sharul# pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then #sharul# [ah] #sharul# took two weeks before me then I met up with him for dinner he said [oh] he pass already then <malay>gini gini gini</malay> then I'm like !wah! so good [ah]
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
like it's already my fourth time [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> like [oh] <malay>penat nya</malay>
and then I was
(err) <malay>dia sekolah</malay> [eh] private private
ya then some more
(err) during my
so my test was (err) example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this (err) I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson
<malay>sebab aku macam takut gila</malay> but then monday I just went to the place and then I
I passed it I passed it was surprise so thankful
ya he he did he
he study before he failed then he
he took a break for a few years then he come back no I I didn't compare [lah] it just that
because I'm like [eh] !wah! he got it [eh] I also <malay>macam</malay> I want to [lah] because I really want to drive
ya but then now now that I already have license and

I want to say sorry please please accept please accept us for who we are and what we talk about
we are students
[eh] you know you got sorry I I just want to say to you [eh] I got offered okay [lah] my friend <malay>yang kerja kat</malay> raffles <malay>dulu</malay> she !wah! I was so touched you know like like yesterday <malay>dia tiba-tiba</malay> texted me say #izwal# (err) cause I ask her before <malay>dia ada</malay> slot <malay>tak kat tempat kerja dia kerja</malay> [lah] then she say don't have then
!huh! <malay>bukan</malay> it's just normal clinic clinic because she work in a clinic

has spot
for like vacancy for application [ah] for job application
then [eh] I went to email the person you know okay but I don't know whether I get it or not because the person hasn't reply yet
but [ah] (err) the working hours is on weekdays but it's a twelve hour shift [ah] so probably I can only work
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] actually saturday sunday <malay>pun</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> because next sem is like

wait sorry I cannot hear you can you repeat again
ya I know you got cut a bit okay
testing testing one two three [eh] [eh] okay okay [dah] [dah] [dah]
ya ya can can
to cope with the lesson
no I was just thinking okay because my main rationale [kan] was I I mean I could have sign a bond with like hospital <malay>tapi</malay> my main rationale behind not signing a bond because I don't wanna decide on myself too too early because I'm still year one
and then I rather use this time as an experience you know
like compare to my friends that actually sign a bond like you know
this maybe this one year that they they're actually getting allowance and everything
while they are actually getting allowance and not be able to work outside I'm currently working outside gaining that experience so it's like a headstart as compared to them
then somemore I'm like taking like
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean hospital hospital [lah] but then different hospital is different ways of like
<malay>apa ni</malay> work style environment right so I am trying to trying to like keep my options open for now first [lah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> like suddenly <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> sign to a place [ah] then <malay>menyesal</malay>
regret
ya I don't want to regret
sign on <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
sign on <malay>kena</malay> [eh] no [eh] [ah] I think sign on I will be a nursing officer
yes I am with I think I think so I don't know
but I must go through you know I must go through [eh]
it's tiring dude
ya it just

urgent matter should be jamming soon
<malay>lama gila</malay> #dok#
<malay>aku rasa</malay> the last <malay>kita</malay> jam before circuit breaker <malay>atau</malay>
<malay>kita tak</malay> jam <malay>terus lepas balik yang</malay> vietnam <malay>punya</malay> show <malay>lama lama gila lama gila babi</malay>
like <malay>semua semua</malay> put on hold [lah] okay [lah] but at least other bands <malay>macam ada</malay> jam [ah] like space ya quite active [lah] like no cause we also we we also
finishing up our [what]
but then not jamming it's more of mixing but that one also would be like on friday on like
(err) friday night [ah] he
like take some time off just to do the mixing [lah] but I think cause that time we prioritise on that first [lah] cause <malay>dah lama gila</malay> [seh] like hold back <malay>kita punya</malay> recording
so
<malay>entah tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dah habis</malay> [ah] <malay>dah habis</malay> mix <malay>dah habis</malay> finally <malay>habis</malay> [ah] like <malay>dah</malay> #swee# [ah] <malay>tinggal hantar</malay> mastering then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> we still finding for for people [lor] (um)
don't know finding the for the best deal expensive [sia] like mastering
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] (err) overseas [ah]
<malay>tapi tak tahu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu dorang boleh dapat</malay> sound <malay>dia ke tak</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> #haji hussin# <malay>boleh</malay>
(err) [oh] <malay>tu dia punya</malay> mixing mastering suite [eh]
<malay>tak nanti nanti aku berbual dengan dorang</malay> [ah] try to talk to them we also finding [ah] we will be sitting down
ya I heard [ah] I heard but I will sit down and talk to them see cause we still need to sit down and discuss about the design cause we planning to release like song by song [ah] instead not like all one shot [ah] on spotify [ah]
I don't know [ah] that's the plan [ah] I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like <malay>kita</malay> release <malay>macam</malay> all one shot [kan] <malay>nanti macam</malay> people get bored easily [ah] like [ah] so <malay>kita punya</malay> style <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] I mean is four songs only <malay>apa</malay> it's not it's not like a whole album [lah] if whole album then
planning [ah] there's also the plan to do a video clip [ah]
but but don't know [eh] (err)
what what's the whole concept [ah] you know what I mean the whole concept of the is <malay>macam</malay> is all (err) is is interconnected [ah] is like (err) is like (err) <malay>macam</malay> a story [ah] from song number one to song number four
[ah] yes concept album so <malay>semua macam</malay> interconnected [ah] there's a story to it [ah]
so <malay>kita</malay> plan <malay>macam</malay> release song by song right then every song <malay>ada</malay> different artwork
so the artwork will end up with one whole piece of artwork that is all relatable [ah] (err) so
ya [lah] that's the plan [lah] but we need to sit down and talk again [lah] cause also budget [lah] budget we of course to do video like this must have you know (err)
budget [ah] see what kind of concept [lah] then also must pay for mastering (err) then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see [ah] we'll see how it goes [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan kayuh</malay> [ah]
well okay [lah] at least moving [lah] you know cause we were we were stuck [ah] cause of the circuit breaker [ah] cause we were already in the process already
mixing during before circuit breaker like really
(uh) most likely will be #wan# G [lah]
in-house [ah] better [ah] cause he cause he understands the song or if not we try to
I mean like me #hanis# #akid# sit we sat down and talk we we say maybe we can call #zaki# [lah] #zaki# ex-member [pe] so at least he kind of have the same feel of the band [lah] [ah] but see how [ah] if he is interested [ah] if not then we get #wan# G [lah] you know at least so I mean #zaki# left the band
<malay>tapi dia</malay> still <malay>macam</malay> part of it [pe] part of us <malay>dia tak keluar</malay> like know <malay>tak keluar</malay> in a bad terms <malay>dia keluar</malay> in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning [pe] ya so then <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] then we will we'll see how [ah] <malay>kita nanti duduk berbual</malay> we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
#zaki# freelance [ah]

<malay>hujung tahun ni</malay> [ah]
ya true
[oh] beat a
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] but at least you guys went tour already [sia]
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
I think [sial] is very influential <malay>macam banyak</malay> influence (err) <malay>orang-orang</malay> probably also cause of
<malay>dia</malay> female fronted
<malay>abeh</malay> and then <malay>nyanyi</malay> malay <malay>lagu melayu</malay>
then very very strong musical <malay>apa</malay>
musically very strong [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah] that's good
<malay>bagus juga</malay> rare <malay>juga nampak</malay> band <malay>macam</malay> gitu like playing <malay>macam</malay>
those dark waves
<malay>betul aku</malay> realise that <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
I mean <malay>aku ikut korang yang</malay> time europe tour <malay>aku</malay> realise actually <malay>aku</malay> get to see many things
with little cost [ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
but then again I think the twenty four hours <malay>pun macam</malay> can feel the vibe [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you are still <malay>macam dekat</malay> another country [orh] then you see like even though <malay>macam</malay> say for example [eh] for example <malay>kau main</malay> germany [ah] but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different [ah]
so at least you get to see that culture know <malay>macam</malay> #berlin# really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very <malay>ni</malay> and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very <malay>kampung</malay> like in <malay>kampung</malay> [ah] but then
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours [eh] is also to me an opener [ah] it's still fun [ah] it's still fun [ah] I mean as following tour [ah] so
yes
ya [lah]
but then again also I think it's not also about touring [ah] I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring [ah] you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe [ah] then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
<malay>macam</malay> save cost [ah] <malay>kau tak payah</malay> spend <malay>duit</malay> on <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay> lodging <malay>dorang</malay> will <malay>kasi kau</malay> crash <malay>tempat dorang</malay> I mean that's the give and take [ah] you know
ya so
(mm) (mm)
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
<malay>asal</malay>
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
I mean I think <malay>dia</malay> maybe that his style [ah] if he don't like that culture or not say culture [ah] he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go [lah]
[ah] same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks [ah] two weeks <malay>pun dah cukup</malay>
cause <malay>kalau tak rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
that's why
cause <malay>aku</malay> realise #siti# is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social <malay>apa</malay> instagram
she can travel alone <malay>dia boleh</malay> travel alone <malay>pergi macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>gila</malay> cause <malay>aku</malay> realise cause <malay>bila</malay> that time <malay>kita dekat</malay> london <malay>tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> willing to go <malay>jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai</malay> explore [seh] like like she knows her way [ah] like to to just explore [ah] <malay>dia tak takut</malay> she got she's fearless [ah] but I think
that something <malay>yang</malay> holding her back [ah]
scared [sia]
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person [ah]
ya but <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku pun nak</malay> tour [lah] <malay>dengan macam</malay> urgent matter I mean missy shoot <malay>lain sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kalau nak</malay> tour
probably <malay>lagi susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> #lal# <malay>pun macam</malay> #iman's# league right and then it's very
it'll be hard [lah] I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was #iman's# league [ah] then he came back so but I think he he still very on [lah] he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask [eh] does this <malay>ni kena tak</malay>
then <malay>macam tak</malay> [ah] <malay>ni tak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> very very #iman's# league [ah] okay <malay>tak apa</malay> then <malay>dia akan tukar</malay> to change to <malay>kita punya</malay> vibe
<malay>selalunya</malay> is #dol# or most of the time is #dol# [lah]
but [ah] #lal# recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs [ah] one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas [lah] lyric lyric wise would be #dol# [lah] cause his lyrics are actually very good
#hakim# fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
he he he did give some ideas (err) when we take in some ideas some ideas <malay>macam tak kena</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into <malay>macam</malay> very rubik's vibes
[ah] skate punk like a lot of
you know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
(err) but he will try to control he he don't want to <malay>macam dia tak nak tukar</malay> the sounds
[ah] bad religion I mean influence [ah] cause we influence with bad religion <malay>abeh macam</malay> influence with rise against #dol# <malay>punya</malay> influence is heavily rise against
heavy #lal# is very melodic guy #lal# <malay>suka</malay> melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with <malay>macam</malay> he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he <malay>dia banyak macam</malay> on that vibe but <malay>aku</malay> is more very bad religion penny wise [ah]
#hakim# is very #propagandhi#
[ah] #propagandhi# (err) that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but <malay>bagusnya</malay> everything is jumble up you see so <malay>semua dah</malay> jumble up <malay>semua dah macam</malay>
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part [ah]
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah]
confirm blast [kan]
[oh] [oh] #farhan# [eh]
but <malay>entah</malay> [eh]
but but
[ah] ya
<malay>dia macam</malay> very (err) straight [kan]
<malay>tapi dorang tak tahu</malay> [ah] #zul# <malay>dah tak cakap dengan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> bob [ah] [eh] practise [ah] single pedal <malay>aku</malay> feel playing single pedal
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel [lah] you can also hear that is double [ah] like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
<malay>yang buat dia</malay> very unique [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> unique <malay>gila</malay> [ah] but then [ah] to each its own [ah] style [ah] ya but see [ah] see [ah] I don't know [ah] we still got a
right
I don't know [ah] is their style [ah]
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song [ah] that kind of vibe [ah] but then
[ah] ya ya
ya relevant bands [ah]
<malay>betul dorang dah</malay> boring [ah]
they they they they suck life [ah] or they suck [ah] actually personally I don't listen to them already [ah] like rarely listen to them
bad religion still stick to that sound but then <malay>ada</malay> modern element I feel [ah] that's how I feel
penny wise will still be that sound [ah] cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
(err) still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album [what]
last year [ah] not bad [lah] but still the same sound [ah]
I like penny wise but I still prefer
he got a vibe [ah] a different vibe I still like bad religion [ah] cause <malay>dorang</malay>
cause they very <malay>abang abang</malay>
ya [ah] professor professor [sia] vocalist professor [siol] [sia]
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene [ah] they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like (err) surfers and skateboarders [mah]
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets [ah] but they are very intelligent people [ah]
tony hawk pro skater [eh]
no I don't like him [ah]
I don't know [ah] he some pop punkers like feeling feeling <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> very <malay>kental</malay> [ah] I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing [ah]
but cannot [ah]
but okay [lah] see how [lah] missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause #wan# G got a new bass
<malay>tapi tengah</malay> set [ah]
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
[ah] I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape [one] then he just need to redo the everything [ah] so he give to #hakim# #hakim#
#maggot# #maggot# [ah] #maggot# setting up for him [ah] then he gonna after that we jam [ah]
composer
all of us [ah] together but #wan# G is the one that do everything [lah] so
yes (err) so we input ideas [lah] [ah] like but but #wan# G will will #wan# G will do first [lah] at home then after that after he do
then will send us then <malay>cakap</malay> okay (err) <malay>ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit</malay>
(err) then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then <malay>bila</malay> time <malay>jumpa baru</malay> like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then <malay>dah</malay> [lah] see how <malay>pasal kita</malay> record with no clicks then very simple (err)
miking <malay>macam</malay> drums only four mikes (err) so that's why some sound <malay>macam</malay> really <malay>tak boleh dapat</malay> and stuff [lah] but we this is like a trial [ah] for me [lah] it's a trial [ah] but then <malay>nanti tengok</malay> [ah] like in future future recording <malay>kita</malay> do it like better [ah]
cause #hakim# <malay>macam dah</malay> offer [eh] next recording <malay>aku aku</malay> will make sure like all the all the miking will be better [lah]
I don't know he [ah] to me it's okay [lah]
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something [lah] and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
ya [lah] that's why <malay>dia dia</malay> discovered <malay>tu pasal</malay> that time actually <malay>dia</malay> offered to <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam kau nak</malay> rerecord <malay>balik kau punya</malay> drum but then
[ah] but then <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ada</malay> click [orh] we don't play with click so it's gonna be <malay>susah</malay> [sia] like okay [lah] we try [ah] I did record like what (um) we tried half a song [ah] but it's difficult cause there's no click
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said [eh]
<malay>tak</malay> feel [ah] like <malay>tak</malay> feel [ah] so then I think then I told him next time [ah] like the next time we we we try to record
(err) better [ah]
cause he discover but good thing that but good [ah] he's very hardworking <malay>dia</malay> discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input [lah] but then again it's not a bad recording [ah] this time
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound [eh] I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
correct but then have to be patient [ah] but then but then again for example this spacedays <malay>punya</malay>
spacedays <malay>punya</malay> vibe is because we we needed to
do it fast [ah] cause we delay too long already [ah] [ah] so we we we say never mind [lah] we we we told #hakim# next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you [ah] but because we already comfortable [eh] and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff [lah]
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like [ah] [ah] recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
[ah] bass man [ah] it I think is
big one the big one tall one [ah] bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish <malay>balik</malay> (err) for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky [ah] I think I think he's damn lucky [ah] like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
<malay>dia rajin gila</malay> [ah] ya but good [lah] know he he he he invests on that [lah] he invests on that then to have like
good sounds for the band [lah]
so far his recordings are actually good [ah] his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good [ah] for me [lah] personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient #yadi# is [lah]
cause must commit correct must commit
cause #hakim# is very hardworking that is his his income [pe] his livelihood [pe]
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands [lah] but from what
then <malay>apa tu</malay> force vomit <malay>pun tengah</malay> record
[ah] then recently <malay>dia cakap</malay> last week [eh] last week <malay>dia cakap</malay> dia record <malay>dikir barat</malay>
[sia]
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this #ranggi# #ranggi# guys [ah] #ranggi# is the motorcycle <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so #ranggi# is actually <malay>macam</malay> (um)
#ranggi# is (err) some of them <malay>ada budak-budak dikir barat</malay> [ah]
so I think <malay>dorang</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> #hakim# is a <malay>buat</malay> sounds [pe]
so <malay>dia macam pergi dekat dia</malay> [lah] but then <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] then it's like side bazaar bush man <malay>dia punya</malay> side project
no no no he he got another reggae band
(err)
#adib# I think #adib# playing bass (err) then got (err) (um) #restam# bushman <malay>main</malay> guitar then (err) #rizal# #rizal# <malay>dulu main</malay> sound of province #rizal# <malay>main</malay> sound of province <malay>dulu</malay>
#rizal# <malay>kecil</malay>
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer [ah] ya ya ya #rizal#
he covered [ah] session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer [lah] then <malay>dia main</malay> for this band <malay>aku tak tahu siapa lagi</malay> a few more guys [ah] like play for his band
so I think recorded there also
(err) even stoned revivals [ah] remix sound that song [oh] no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it (err) make it into malay also (err) I think #goodil# [eh]
ya [lah] but how they do it right is like (err) (err)
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia #esam# #esam# australia #esam# will record
(err) we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here [ah]
so <malay>dorang macam</malay> rerecord <malay>balik</malay> [ah] ya
(um) but then financially maybe <malay>tak sangat</malay> [lah]
ya but it also depends on him [what] he I don't know but
don't know [ah] but
I I don't know [ah] but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay [lah] I think #zad# also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good [ah]
youtube #siao# he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out [ah] into it [ah]
yes correct
but then see [lah] maybe maybe in future [lah] maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest [ah] but one thing about #zad# I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good [sia] cause he feels #paiseh# [lah] want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use [lah] I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks [lah] cause it's a wear and tear
[ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>tak aku cakap dengan</malay> #zad# <malay>juga</malay> #zad# <malay>dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh</malay> then <malay>tiba-tiba macam korang main</malay> <malay>semua cakap</malay> #zad# <malay>kau nak pakai pakai</malay> [ah] kau nak pakai pakai [ah] [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> [jer] it's a wear and tear thing
<malay>aku tahu dia mahal</malay> but then I'm giving you that that green light <malay>apa</malay> that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay [ah] understand sometimes people don't want to <malay>terhutang budi kau tahu</malay>
that's why
<malay>tak</malay> maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe <malay>dulu dia pernah macam</malay> have this friend who like okay just use [ah] then after that after using already then like [eh] !wah! now I want to you never give me back <malay>macam</malay> you know
#jialat# [ah] #jialat# got friend [ah] but then <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] but I'm okay [ah] kalau #zad# <malay>nak pinjam</malay>
of course
<malay>dah</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> end of the day also all the stuff <malay>macam</malay> like it's a wear and tear <malay>punya benda</malay> [pe] so
<malay>tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah</malay> [eh] you also broken [what] it'll also break [what] like know like so it's okay [lah] I mean the thing is
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable [what] it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay [lah] I mean I understand
ya that's why <malay>kesian</malay> [sia] I know he's been <malay>macam dia berbual dengan aku</malay> [ah] like cannot wait [sia] I cannot wait to play drums [sia]
[ah] I cannot wait to <malay>lepak</malay> I cannot wait to record you know I told him [lah] if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us [lah] we can help you set up the mic setting [ah]
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
like I know he don't want to <malay>terhutang budi</malay> that's confirm and maybe his style is different <malay>dia takut macam dia
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold [eh] <malay>macam</malay> don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt [what] hurt the feeling hurt [what] so I don't think he's like that
but <malay>kita dah cakap</malay> [ah] I mean I already told him also [eh] <malay>kalau kau</malay> need to record you need help you just call us [lah] [ah] we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you [ah] cause you is is is you are the one doing the work
we here just to help <malay>lepak</malay>
[ah] we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him [lah] if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever [lah] run everything if [ah] confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury [lah] so then
at least you know before to record we come here [lah] we help you to shift the whatever [lah] amp
ya shift the mic [lah] whatever then you just tell us what to do then we help you run then everything goes on cause we we willing to help cause we know you have the potential [sia]

he confirm don't want
he confirm don't want
ya [lah]
no the thing is the no the walk that time the plan right #zad# was okay #zad# wanted to do it he injured [what]
[ah]
no but the thing is this type of thing right the walk right you cannot <malay>pikiran</malay> you know just go regret <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] regret after that [ah] but there's no regret [ah] I mean for me personally when I went (err) the walk was was <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] the starting was fun cause everything but
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental [ah] mental [ah] it's it is more of mental
no but she also was struggling [ah] cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like [eh] guys guys <malay>sekejap sekejap sekejap</malay> stop stop stop <malay>aku tak boleh aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] so we actually sat down and #azil# <malay>macam</malay> okay no problem no problem <malay>duduk</malay>
then it was like <malay>matahari dekat mata</malay> the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we #lek# <malay>sekejap</malay> #lek# <malay>sekejap</malay>
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend [what] then then we just walk [ah] so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to #punggol# end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk [ah]
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] for me [ah] personally but I told them sorry [ah] I say #paiseh# #paiseh# [ah] like we have to have a lot of stops
[ah] but #azil# also said never mind [ah] we take it slow [ah] don't don't
don't force yourself [lah] you know then to give up also now is like wasted [sia] ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself [ah]
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle [ah] [ah] so we did manage to finish [ah] so the moment we touch that thing right <malay>kita cakap kita sampai</malay> right
<malay>macam macam</malay> #azil# we made it [ah] we just high five [sia]
[eh] take photo take photo take photo <malay>lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan</malay> I lie down already [sia] I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks #azil# take out socks take out shoes #aisyah# also sit down then all <malay>termenung</malay> already like good twenty minutes
twenty minutes half an hour after that #aisyah# like okay [ah] then we all like come [lah] let's go [ah] #hafiz# waiting
[eh] #hafiz# fetching [ah] <malay>jalan</malay> to the #punggol# settlement there is like another one click [ah]
[ah] [ah]
one point five click [ah] <malay>betul</malay>
so we had to walk for one plus click [ah]
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
so that was the slowest walk to #punggol# (err) settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already [ah] like [oh] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>mata dah rabak</malay> I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also <malay>malas</malay> you know like want to <malay>minum air</malay> just drink water [ah] drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually #hamimah# #zafran# all they wake already they wanted to go <malay>makan</malay>
ya [lah] breakfast but cause #aisyah# [ah] #hafiz# fetching #aisyah# [mah] so they wanted to go <malay>makan</malay> then they ask you and #nazril# <malay>kau dengan</malay> #nazril# plan [ah] <malay>nak pergi makan mana</malay> then <malay>kita jumpa</malay> somewhere <malay>tu aku cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>kita nak balik tidur balik tidur</malay> [ah] <malay>nak balik tidur</malay>
so #hafiz# fetch us fetch actually wanted to fetch fetch #aisyah# then we wanted to grab home then #hafiz# <malay>cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku hantar korang</malay> [ah]
<malay>dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari</malay> toilet <malay>aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah</malay> slow <malay>gila</malay> then <malay>aku duduk aku duduk macam</malay> [eh] [sia] [ah] to go into the car also <malay>macam</malay> [eh] [sia] [ah] <malay>rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[ah]
#siao#
[ah] [ah]
[oh] there the park connector [ah]
go to coastal
east coast
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> [oh] ya ya cause coastal
it's wrong coastal the coastal #tanah merah# coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
twenty one [eh] like like almost twenty clicks [ah] actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way (err) #hud# told me is about twenty five clicks <malay>ye</malay>
ya so ya [lah] but don't know [ah] but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard [ah]
so ya [lah] but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
<malay>tak</malay> but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
whatever we can cut we cut [ah] no [lah] but
#yio chu kang# #sengkang# cannot [ah] must go that way no actually right
[oh] cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the #buangkok# is the nearest to reach [ah] but that one is also quite a stretch [ah]
[ah] [ah] but but is like you walk walk [eh] park connector park connector then you see [eh] #sengkang# already
that #sengkang# we thought you is after that bridge thought the #sengkang# is already #punggol# <malay>sekali</malay> [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> it's another #sengkang#
the other end then you go in front another bridge [oh] that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of #sengkang#
then you go to #punggol# so that from #punggol# the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay [ah] this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just #sumang#
so that #sumang# is the end the beginning of that #sumang# is like the end middle of #punggol# [lah] that #sumang#
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector <malay>dia macam sampai dekat</malay> red bridge [tau] but this one is before red bridge <malay>kau dah belok kiri</malay>
so there's another route [ah] so there's another route to walk
but we see [lah] we try again [ah]
we see next time maybe end of the year [lah] okay [lah] K K K

public you have to wait
ya so <malay>kalau</malay> private they

I mean <malay>memang</malay> [ah] it's a show but it's too overplayed
<malay>macam terlalu</malay> drama [lah]
ya
(mm) but
(mm)
I know dan
I know it's he he
I know dan is <malay>jadi</malay> gossip girl <malay>tetapi macam tak</malay> make sense [eh] story <malay>kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku</malay>
story <malay>kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku</malay>
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
ya
(mm) yes
(mm) <malay>sebab boleh nampak</malay> (mm)
ya
<malay>tetapi kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja</malay>
<malay>dia tak masuk akal</malay>
because dan
<malay>dia macam</malay> he in one scene <malay>dia pun terjekut</malay> he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so <malay>dia</malay> texting <malay>diri dia sendiri</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
<malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl <malay>boleh masuk akal</malay>
can make sense
ya or <malay>macam</malay>
but it also makes even more sense if everything that was sent through gossip girl just went up like that without filter
(mm) so the shock vaue makes sense [lah]
ya the fact
no the end result make him look like a psychopath
ya and the fact that <malay>dia dapat</malay> marry serena <malay>pun macam</malay> (err)
(mm)
I mean the
he gaslight
serena and then he talk trash about her <malay>dekat</malay> gossip girl
(mm) raccoon [lah] <malay>bapa dia pun sama</malay> [jer]
no the daughter also
no
vanessa
(mm)
but I like
#ya allah#
<malay>macam mana tak terkoyak seluar</malay>
(mm)
yes
<malay>tetapi</malay> wait <malay>dia punya</malay> part
part <malay>rambut itu</malay>
no [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> hairstyle <malay>dia kadang-kadang macam tak</malay> match
<malay>pelik</malay>
(mm) yes
[eh] <malay>dia dalam cerita</malay> star trek
[oh] <malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
what about her
(uh) <malay>siapa baru</malay> give birth <malay>tak</malay> [eh]

(mm) [oh]
(mm) ya

(mm)
<malay>sebab dah tengok semua cerita lain</malay>
family [eh]
[oh] ya
a bit quite boring
for me
(mm)
ya
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I mean I'm saving up all the <malay>cerita</malay> for after exams
ya
next week
(mm) <malay>tengah belajar</malay>
school is okay a bit stressful but normal [lah] [kan]
normal
if you're not on your toes means you're too comfortable what
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
I know
I mean you just
you just want to know for yourself or you want to help other people
coping mechanism
yes
suspicions
I mean
degrees and diplomas they are not cheap
so <malay>nak kena</malay> make sure [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> make sure <malay>betul-betul nak</malay> yes
time dedication
don't let it be just a simple [oh]
<malay>macam</malay> interesting [jer]
(mm)
personally like based on your achievements already right you already have architecture mass comm and business
so
they can all be interrelated right you can make a business out of architecture and you can
promote it through mass comm yes
psychology is something you can take on <malay>tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa</malay>
yes
<malay>sekarang ini bila nak ambil ini ada tak yang perlu</malay>
time <malay>duit</malay> and <malay>betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja</malay>
(uh) well <malay>selalunya orang cakap</malay> two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
diploma first
still need three out of three still need time and dedication
but <malay>tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil</malay>
<malay>ada duit ada</malay> time <malay>tapi kalau tak ada</malay> dedication <malay>macam buang masa</malay>
[ah] so you need all three
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you <malay>ada</malay> [lah] these three
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yes
<malay>perangai melayu</malay> yes
<malay>habis</malay>

that's why
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>fikir pasal duit</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang memang</malay> okay
but <malay>kalau nak ambil</malay> one more
financially taxing item can you cope or not
and <malay>kalau</malay>
(mm)
wet tissue
personal <malay>betul</malay>
nineteen
they will get the gist

<malay>tak nak ambil sebab nak kena ambil nak ambil sebab nak ambil</malay>
<malay>sekarang tak nak sekarang macam</malay>
<malay>nak fikir pasal sekolah</malay> so <malay>kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena</malay> divide
exciting <malay>itu memang</malay> [lah] but <malay>sekarang</malay> I <malay>pun tak ada kereta</malay>
ya <malay>tetapi kalau tak ada macam</malay>
<malay>kalau tak ada</malay> use for <malay>kereta</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> waste of time <malay>itu sahaja</malay>
and
ya [lah] I <malay>sudah biasa sangat naik</malay> public transport
(mm)
[orh]
yes I still want to go to america I still want to see new york
even
ya and pretty much every political thing there
really just clashes with the fact that I wear hijab
yes
like before trump
if I were to go there I would still be
discriminated discriminated against just for wearing my hijab
then after trump it was even worse now is is
also very worse
ya but now is and is also still is not finished [lah] I mean
ya everything everything now is all about race in america
(mm)

(err)
<malay>aku</malay> feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
it'll be hard [ah]
transport
just free transport for everybody
it would cost a lot of but then the thing about that is that
a lot of people will take more transport then it will be over congested
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially <malay>kat</malay> Singapore [kan] <malay>kitanya</malay> country small
unless other places but I've heard like some other countries also like actually provide free transport
I've heard
[oh] <malay>mak</malay> yes

[oh] then (uh) how how's your job search
then (um)
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now [eh] all the interview [ah]
the developer they [eh] you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
[ah] interview maybe <malay>yang</malay> second time [ah] second time <malay>dia orang suruh ambil</malay> this kind
this kind of coding test [kan]
[oh]
no I mean (uh) <malay>bukan yang bukan</malay> [tau] the the one at (uh) what you call that
the the you must type the code inside
that one you that one <malay>tak boleh</malay> search <malay>apa</malay> online
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
(mm)
okay
(um) <malay>tak</malay>
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
[ah] I think they really keep calling you know
yesterday there's <malay>ada satu</malay> interview [eh] recruiter [kan]
it's like
what's the word [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
very pushy [ah] so like
like you know like you ask them to call back [kan] <malay>abeh dia cakap</malay> [ah] no only two minutes <malay>macam</malay> a bit annoying [ah] you know
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
[ah] what is the maximum [lah] the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm [ah] [kan] because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit [ah] pointless [kan]
so like
<malay>orang melayu cakap</malay> (um) <malay>jangan apa</malay>
[ah] I forgot the word lowball [ah] something like lowball [ah]
no no value [ah] [kan]
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
most of the job <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> !aiya! it's like contract it's not really [ah]
it's not permanent [ah] but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
that is that makes sense [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> nobody will also <malay>macam</malay>
be eager to you know (um) ya
join the company like this
[ah] mostly
full time but because <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] I teach tuition [kan]
so tuition
but ya that's why
no but tuition only left <malay>lagi dua bulan</malay> [ah] until (um) october [kan] O level <malay>atau</malay> N level [kan]
so that time middle of october [kan] so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months [ah] [kan] so actually
last week I just start (um) this new student [ah] <malay>budak melayu</malay> [ah] <malay>budak apa</malay> N level [ah] N level <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit batok#
I think one or two weeks before [ah] two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right [ah] so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest [ah] maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same [ah] one week difference I think
the normal tech
!huh!
ya
no I think now they they make more centres [ah] I think they I think <malay>dia orang</malay> there's no way they can do in a big hall [what] [kan]
because like the hall
it's like a big group [ah] then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
then <malay>yang</malay> students <malay>yang lain</malay> all <malay>pergi</malay> normal classroom [ah]
I think same time [ah] the the whole singapore <malay>mesti</malay> same time [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> later how to know that you know
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better [lah] until october
I think part time got got a a lot job [ah] <malay>macam yang</malay> this (um)
<malay>kat mana</malay> [eh] (um)
data entry [lah] you know those
just typing on excel [kan] basic [ah]
[ah] office [ah] and typing or sending email those basic admin work [ah]
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description [kan] is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said (um) they said okay monday to friday the timing is (um) I think
about five to ten [ah] or four to ten like five hours [ah] or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
for part time <malay>mesti</malay> commit
(um) for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply (um) sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear [ah]
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer [ah] so
for me best is (um) data analsyt <malay>atau</malay> business analyst
<malay>atau</malay> system analyst [ah]
like but mostly mostly also must support [ah] because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
<malay>kena</malay> twenty four seven support
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support [kan]
so phone support is a bit too much [ah] you know
[ah] that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
it's like like to me not much difference right <malay>kalau</malay> work from home then
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
I think python <malay>macam</malay> python for me is okay [lah] because it's a
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable [kan] it's a it's it's python programming considered high level [kan]
actually high level is the the code that <malay>macam</malay> can be readable [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay> if a human being <malay>baca</malay> the code
(uh) they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
(mm)
[ah] there's this code thing called fortran right <malay>betul tak</malay>
it's called [ah] fortran
A N ya
then what <malay>ni apa</malay> this there's this language <malay>namanya</malay> C hash [eh] <malay>apa</malay> C hash [eh] is it
is it C hash or something hash
[ah] C sharp
!huh! golac
G G O L A C [eh]
[oh] golang
but it's (um) the pace is what like <malay>dia ikut</malay> which (um) which language
(mm)
okay then
because
I don't really like to like build you know <malay>macam</malay> build all the app
building [kan]
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these [ah] data and then maybe
a bit of support [ah] the support kind of role [ah]
because like for me last time I work in a bank [kan]
<malay>ingat tak</malay> (um) during the year twenty
twenty nineteen [ah] twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
[kan]
that time I work in a bank [kan] so
my job mostly like [ah] then investigate [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
so (um) laymans [kan] the back end [ah] so
you know logs [kan] you know logs
L O G S [ah] log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
[ah] error error <malay>dia akan</malay> email [kan] so times ten [kan] times ten
go to back end and then take everything out [lah]
then investigate maybe or something
(um) the front part is a investigation [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay> need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
but the it's like ticket [ah] like they say what
support and ticket and then
(uh) raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close [ah]
then last what you call that analyse [ah] whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite (um) interesting or it's it's quite a
like enriching to do this kind of work but <malay>yang tak suka</malay> is the I really <malay>benci</malay> is support twenty four seven on the phone [ah]
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called (uh) run the bank [ah] not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means (um)
it means that the the app is ongoing [ah] you understand like it's not a project [ah] that means the project already finish that means it's live [ah] live product being used by users [ah]
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china (uh) all this so the timezone all weird weird [one]
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us [what]
ya then their working hours until our six [what] so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues [what] I think there's only one period that
the like not say down time [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
low low what low traffic [eh]
[ah] nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven [ah] because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead [what] only [lah] then just wake up [what] that time
because there's two countries new york [eh] no two states
new york and where [ah] san francisco right [ah]
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server [ah]
I don't think so [ah] or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank [ah] our local bank so ya the business not so much [ah]
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this [ah] this basic functions [ah] [kan]
[oh] they call it the green [eh] green lane [eh]
but but
we cannot go right
<malay>nenek boleh pergi balik</malay> [ah] <malay>nenek</malay>
ya but somebody must handle that [what]
(um) I think <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] but [eh] but <malay>dia</malay> right <malay>yang syakilah iman</malay> is maybe [ah] I think
they can come
[ah] they they can say [ah] ya they can use the fact that their house right at #clementi# need to do something [ah] right collect the mail the mailbox [ah] because
[eh] I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think <malay>berlambak</malay> [ah] mail <malay>dia</malay>
(um)
but the the tenant [kan] you know the [eh] now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail [ah]
who
okay
no [ah] [oh] auntie I always just say <malay>cik cik rozi</malay> [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> something [ah]
cousins (uh)
they I think busy also [ah]
then <malay>dah</malay> you all <malay>dah makan belum</malay>
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight [ah]
<malay>semua tengah tidur</malay> [kan]
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
<malay>tak dia punya</malay> ingredients [kan] <malay>beli kat pasar atau</malay> (uh)
!huh!
(mm)
so there's money
you mean the <malay>ikan</malay> is the the one that is boneless [eh]
it's not in the fridge [eh]
[oh]
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
(um) <malay>mesti</malay>
fry the [eh] fry the fish first right
ya the sauce right then pour on top [kan] just just <malay>tuang</malay>
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make [ah] <malay>macam</malay> mix and match
<malay>apa apa</malay> ya like
tomato <malay>semua</malay> [ah] tomato (um) pineapple
[ah] capsicum <malay>sedap</malay> I like I like the capsicum
I think the it [ah] the the the preparation is a
the <malay>yang makan masa</malay> [ah] [kan]
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife [ah] hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid [ah]
but it's it's good if you have a maid [ah] but
for for us actually if let's say our our family [kan] <malay>macam nak ada</malay> maid [kan]
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
<malay>kalau siapa dah kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>atau</malay> like we have our own house [kan] maybe separate [ah] let's say I
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house [kan] so one maid right (um) share our #woodlands# house
they maybe my future house or your future house [ah] so then like the maid right
no I mean like one maid [ah] because like the maid <malay>tak payah</malay> just stay at one house do all the work [what] because sometimes <malay>mak ada nenek ada</malay> [kan] so maybe can
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else [ah] like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first [ah]
(hmm)
ya
no but I think
internally [kan] if
the maid is okay then we we must <malay>bayar</malay> for the transport
and maybe give them time off [ah] [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off [ah] right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal [ah] because (um) as long the maid
<malay>tak</malay> complain <malay>atau tak</malay>
feel <malay>macam</malay> pressure [kan] we we like they call it give and take [ah]
don't over over work the maid [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> maid is okay then okay [what] you know
!huh!
normally the maid off sunday [kan] one day off [kan]
ya
this one maybe we can plan ten [ah] next time because <malay>bapak</malay> [kan] <malay>dah tua<malay> [kan] <malay>nanti mak</malay>
like at least like the maid <malay>boleh masakkan</malay> actually the best [kan] the maid <malay>masak</malay>
right because if the maid <malay>masak</malay> right then we just need to buy the stuff [ah] then <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh</malay> just order online [kan]
but any online <malay>pasar</malay> or not <malay>macam pasar</malay> food [eh] buy meat or chicken <malay>ada</malay> [eh]
but I mean like the <malay>betul punya pasar</malay> online maybe maybe
no because fairprice <malay>jual</malay> beef <malay>tak</malay> [eh] because beef is very hard to find right
but I think they're a bit
[eh]
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map [kan] is fixed [ah]
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual [ah]
ya then if the stock finish
(um) <malay>macam mana</malay> the person <malay>tahu</malay>
[oh] !wah! cool [ah]
[oh] no [oh] but means the device [kan] then the the user <malay>mesti jalan</malay> to
so call move [ah]
I think no but
I think I think [ah] Singapore difficult because you know why or not
our our house all small [what] america everything is so big [kan] I mean america everything you see <malay>dia punya rumah besar-besar</malay> or I think european some also the house big [kan]
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental [ah]
but the device is (uh) quite <malay>mahal</malay> [kan] I think thousands right
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface [ah] the mapping [kan] the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue [ah] [kan]
so seven days <malay>tak payah pergi kerja</malay> [ah] just somewhere else [ah]
but they they can they will monitor your work [ah]
[oh] ya [ah] standard meeting [ah] [kan]
[oh] last time that time zoom you all also use zoom [ah]
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people [kan] during the COVID
really [ah]
!huh! they going to open here [ah]
ya but singapore smart [ah] I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues [ah]
[oh] good [ah] [ah] are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not [ah] now
ya
[oh] open already [ah] I don't know [ah]
<malay>itu hari cakap</malay> open the ikea but [oh] but now open [lah]
half [ah]
I think half of that
[eh] I think because I think
susah nak apa kita</malay>
[ah] predict the people [kan] because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
[oh] actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those (um)
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what [ah] counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot [ah] like last time I went I went exchange also same [ah] I I
because most people will eat solo [ah] because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so nobody can meet their friends to eat [what] so they just have to eat <malay>cepat-cepat makan</malay> then then just <malay>balik</malay> class [ah]
so
the counter table is like just one person [ah] then you face the you face nobody [ah] like you know face like a the wall or something [ah] so it's like against the wall [kan]
[ah] actually they should make like that
but that that time weird you know [ah] <malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa nama kedai dia yang</malay> mister you you know orchid house <malay>dekat</malay> #serangoon# gardens <malay>tu</malay>
orchid house the the indian food <malay>macam mamak</malay> [ah]
<malay>mamak</malay> food
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
<malay>al-azhar gitu</malay> those kind <malay>macam</malay> woodgrove <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
#serangoon# garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor [lah] you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting [ah] like like #al-ameen# at our place the the woodgrove [kan]
ya open concept [ah] like is is like sheltered [lah]
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
phase the first week of phase two [kan] <malay>atau</malay> I think I <malay>jumpa</malay> my friend during the phase two second week [ah] [kan]
phase two is about nineteen june [kan] so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend <malay>makan dekat tu</malay> [ah] orchid house
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person [ah] then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side [tau] that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
<malay>pelik ke</malay> so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird [ah] [kan]
so that means like the four of you [ah] or three of you [kan] will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing [ah] but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then [ah] section off like one table instead of six right become four [lah] you know
I mean they can do that [lah] but I think
maybe today they change [lah] because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
<malay>mesti</malay> customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else [kan] because
because of the <malay>apa</malay> seating arrangement
or if they more than five
and some people they <malay>apa</malay> like they in a group [kan] say eight people [ah] four four [kan]
so I think recently there's a news [ah] then they like to inter change like I think they
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then <malay>bersembang</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan kawan-kawan</malay> [kan]
but I think
but must pity the the business owner [ah] for because actually right like very strict [ah] I mean [eh] it's it's not the [kan]
(uh) [eh] it's so they are very strict [ah]
so
I think some of the
(um) I heard the store owner [kan] <malay>atau</malay> business owner dia orang</malay> call the
[kan] complain [ah] like [oh] call police [ah] I don't know what they call [ah] they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually [oh] at first maybe they ask them to go out [lah] say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
but sometimes we think [oh] it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you <malay>tengok</malay> news
another search [ah] you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy [kan]
ya I think maybe like they have a counter [lah] like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't [ah] what you call that scan out [ah] checkout from the place
[eh] but do do you think it's possible [kan] <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> make a system [kan] means by far away then they auto checkout
[ah] if the person off then <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] [kan]
ya the the app <malay>apa</malay> what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
!huh!
[ah] trace together [kan]
[oh] that one
it's good [kan] <malay>macam</malay> but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
[oh] because of bluetooth [ah]
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
[oh]
so like between [ah] android and they also know what to do right
ya
(um)
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google [ah] [kan]
I don't know [ah] because like maybe I want to try Google [ah] but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air [kan]
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini [eh]
actually that one <malay>bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal</malay> you like [eh] !hey! google then the you can play spotify
you can play (um) I mean you can play the [eh] what's it called [ah] the radio station like singapore radio station
[ah] live streaming [ah] as long you got wifi [lah]
so actually from the wifi [eh] but actually dangerous [oh] I realise [kan] they recognise our voice [oh]
the google home speaker [ah] I mean the I mean google home [ah]
because right that time [kan] my friend [kan]
K because my my friend he <malay>dia pakai</malay> google home [eh] google phone [tau] so I use apple [ah] but the that time I stay #punggol# also share with him [kan]
so
I ask google [ah] using my voice [ah] like when is my birthday or what is my age [ah] something
then they know [ah] cause I think like google gmail [ah] all this something
so like they know (uh) something like my birthday or my name [ah]
then because my friend got google phone right
so he use the the what google assistance [eh] <malay>yang cakap</malay> the voice [ah]
[oh] there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker [ah] the google home speaker [kan] then he ask (um) like what is my name or something [ah]
then the google know that it's him then say his name
[ah] or birthday [ah] [ah] I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess [what]
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person [what]
[ah] so a bit scary [lah] I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community [kan] instagram or something [kan]
<malay>dia cakap</malay> even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
[ah] <malay>macam macam mana nak tahu</malay> [ah]
no I mean <malay>macam mana nak nak tahu</malay> that whether they are listening to you or not
but if the wifi off [kan] but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device [kan]
so will it still listen
no I think if let's say [oh] but I think google [kan] <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] if you like ask question [kan] like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say (um) [oh] sorry we cannot
(um) connect you
to the
but default [ah] but if you ask like questions like (um)
something basic [ah] like (uh) what time is it maybe <malay>dia tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tanya</malay> something like (um)
[ah] offline what do you call it offline data [ah]
what basic basic functions [ah] [kan]
ya
it's good [ah]
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon [what] a lot so
my friend [eh] my friend singaporean [kan] but then he <malay>dia</malay> study full time <malay>dekat pergi luar</malay> [ah]
then <malay>dia punya</malay> apartment [kan]
I think because they also got money [ah] so their apartment like one room one bedroom [ah] so like those studio [ah]
then <malay>dia pun ada</malay> alexa I think now alexa better [ah] because
got how many version [ah] I also don't know [ah]
smart home device [ah]
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven [kan] like is there a brand for smart oven now
[oh]
[oh]
got smart shower or not I don't know
[oh] but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there [lah] because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen [ah] I don't know
or voice [ah]
[eh] but that means right COVID better [what] if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene [kan] then I think maybe future [ah] singapore the lift also maybe smart [kan]
or lift system
I think can make right
[oh] the base I mean there's a pedal [kan]
I think that one <malay>bukan</malay> maybe that one is it thailand something [ah] I cannot remember
[ah] the [ah] the <malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh] [ah] this place [ah] that time I went interview #tanjong pagar# go it's called what guoco tower [ah]
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working [ah] so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens [kan] too many screen one is left one is right [kan]
so when you tap [kan] <malay>dia dia tahu</malay> which which place to go to [ah] like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down [what]
because you card is only one level [ah]

test and
okay hi I'm #amir# I and my partner #salamah#
okay so first conversation was how
I got here [lah] so I mean initially we plan to meet <malay>pukul dua belas gitu</malay> but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay [lah] I want to <malay>naik basikal</malay> then now I'm regretting it [lah]
a bit
hot <malay>pun</malay> it's not <malay>tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah</malay> like the past few days it's not really that got [lah] but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place <malay>tak tak jauh sangat</malay> it's eleven kilometers
and the weather <malay>cuaca pun</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> [lah] so I mean it's okay you got [lah] so I mean it's
but I think it's the perfect time [ah]
I mean when it comes to like face mask from what
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law <malay>tapi dia cakap</malay> difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling <malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask [pe]
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask <malay>yang kena</malay> and the one the government <malay>kasih atau</malay> the one that they government <malay>suruh</malay> [lah]
I just use the <malay>kain</malay> like the one the the they call it the <malay>kain untuk muka</malay>
then
ya ya ya the step cool kind I mean is also to prevent like you like at higher speeds like around you are cycling down
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent [ah] barang-barang kena muka</malay> like some debris you just go to (uh) face what's that at least <malay>apa dia ada</malay> protection because if not like
like you will either injure or just things going your
face your nose or your mouth [lah]
okay ya so I was cycling because I was doing part time
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is <malay>tempat kosong</malay> so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre [lah] maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to <malay>cepat juga</malay> [lah] but then
then some more <malay>ada</malay> construction <malay>tempat</malay> construction so
so the <malay>tempat</malay> construction is just debris [ah] then the <malay>habuk-habuk masuk hidung</malay> then I was like my nose a bit itchy [lah] then I mean
ya but that is okay not compared to there was a time [ah] I was like
cycling down to woodlands just to meet my my my girlfriend my ex girlfriend [lah]
okay [ah] then ya so that that was the time <malay>yang</malay> cause that one <malay>tempat dekat dengan</malay> forest forest <malay>sana</malay> because it's the #ulu# #ulu# <malay>tempat</malay> #ulu# <malay>sana</malay> so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya [lah] (err) <malay>lalat masuk</malay> [lah] <malay>hidung</malay>
[eh] <malay>lalat masuk mulut</malay>
I mean literally it's not at house anymore [lah] <malay>dia dah dekat luar</malay> [lah]
[eh] ya <malay>dia masuk</malay> [lah] I mean
you you imagine you
you are cycling <malay>penat-penat jauh</malay> it's like you are <malay>jauh</malay> then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna <malay>pakai mulut</malay> [eh] <malay>pakai</malay> your <malay>hidung</malay> ya it's <malay>kena</malay> use your <malay>pakai mulut</malay> [lah] you
then by chance the thing <malay>masuk</malay> and <malay>nasib tak masuk</malay> my the the air pipes it <malay>masuk</malay> my esophagus straightaway so I just <malay>telan</malay>
I mean it's it's better that you chewing it [what] like you chew I I don't even know what I taste but
I mean it's just
after that I was okay [ah] so I think the house fly was
<malay>dia makan betul</malay> [ah] I also <malay>tak berak-berak</malay> so okay [ah]
ya I guess so I was fine
<malay>sakit</malay> no [ah] it just
I think it's just extra protein [ah] I don't know <malay>apa dia makan kat</malay> that #ulu# area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots [what] then then they evolve
ya you don't know [meh]
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> some people confirm <malay>makan</malay> maggot [what] good
ya [lah] it's just that I got the most freshest one [lah]
you want <malay>nak makan</malay> bat
ya I
ya
yes I'm I'm taking my bike license [lah] my motorbike license like
I
currently I'm taking <malay>kat</malay> the the #ubi# <malay>sana</malay> [lah] I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing [ah] like <malay>naik basikal</malay> if you exercise you go distance and if you work <malay>pakai kerja</malay> deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also [lah] like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license [lah] bike license <malay>boleh tolong apa</malay> like like two in one so just settle everything
I don't
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> but I I think depends [lah] I think now the the rate <malay>dia dah</malay> really drop <malay>dah jatuh</malay> so
cause I think now there's a influx [dah] <malay>banyak</malay> I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a <malay>ada</malay> grabfood <malay>dengan</malay> foodpanda [eh] <malay>apa</malay> deliveroo account [ah] I don't really need <malay>dapat masuk</malay> joined foodpanda [lah] so I think
I those two is enough [ah] and then now also <malay>masih</malay> because I'm now <malay>masih</malay> like recently <malay>kena</malay> diagnosed <malay>dengan</malay> hyperthyroidism so my <malay>saya</malay> I just <malay>sakit sangat</malay> [lah] I just <malay>susah nak nak</malay> exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down [ah] just do less
I don't remember calling it docket (uh) I think the maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> it's a foodpanda <malay>punya</malay> <malay>benda</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> grabfood <malay>dengan</malay> deliveroo they call it [ah] incentive so <malay>dapat</malay> incentive like you deliver ten [ah]
deliver ten then you will get incentives like maybe for grabfood was ten dollar
you divide it a extra extra five dollar ten dollar then after you deliver hundred than maybe extra
thirty forty dollars that was <malay>itu pun</malay> only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] the <malay>orang lain semua kerja kerja</malay> so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing <malay>orang-orang lain semua</malay> [ah] so
that is grabfood [lah] for for deliveroo incentive <malay>punya ada</malay> every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
I mean I I work for both
I mean not this is not advertisement [lah] but then
they grab the deliveroo their support is like way better [lah]
like you in a in a pickle you just call [jer] <malay>nanti</malay> they just will assist you [ah] <malay>tolong</malay> just <malay>tolong</malay> you like just like that grabfood you call <malay>sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat</malay>
[oh] ya ya depends [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> tip <malay>dia orang nak kasih</malay> tip [ah] I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself <malay>tak ada</malay> tip culture [what] it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip <malay>nanti dia orang fikir</malay> [eh] <malay>ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni</malay> like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
it's not a tipping thing [ah] like the culture
ya
second second
bro that one that one is I mean that one depends like I mean you cannot
that one is they give big tip is maybe
ten dollar
ya they give ten dollar I tip just <malay>kasih</malay> [ah]
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app <malay>atau</malay> the cash so they will just give you cash [ah] like from singapore's tipping
the app like you give you ten dollar that will get the ten dollar because some countries like for example in like happening in other places I think like the their
food their tipping like their the the person the company they <malay>ambil duit</malay> the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip [ah] so that's what the company the company
like it's just
well I mean because <malay>tak ada duit selalu</malay> no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> that account [lah] so ya so my biggest is <malay>paling banyak</malay> is ten dollar [ah] [lah] but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar [lah] <malay>itu dapat terus sepuluh</malay> dollar just just the just deliver and it was a <malay>tempat pun</malay> like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically <malay>tempat dia</malay> is like <malay>depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan</malay> then he just like maybe
fifty meter and <malay>lima puluh</malay> meter [jer] I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar <malay>dia orang kasih</malay> then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter <malay>pergi angkat itu</malay> [jer]
ya I got it for six [eh] four hundred plus [lah] like because
I mean long term [ah] and I think I really gain back that four hundred I've
been a long time ago [lah] like [dah] <malay>lama juga</malay> [ah] I've gained back the <malay>empat ratus tu</malay> so
like four <malay>empat</malay> about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories [ah] <malay>barang</malay> like
it's (err) I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you <malay>pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun</malay> it's you what
ya ya
I mean
the thing is sometime <malay>pun orang</malay> like you rider you will sometimes take <malay>naik basikal</malay> you I mean then you anything happen like then [eh] #guai lan# <malay>padahal</malay> sometimes you forget [eh] your your means your safety first [lah] you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you <malay>lupa</malay> about yourself [lah] so it's quite stupid [ah] sometimes like you
sometimes you see
they those like
food delivery they like I mean
we are paid by <malay>duit apa</malay> by by by time so the time you <malay>cepat</malay> you get more money so <malay>kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu</malay> green green light <malay>belum</malay> green light <malay>tu</malay> showing but you want <malay>nak</malay> to go you want to go
ya [lah] so safety also have to come first [ah] because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk [lah] but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian <malay>jalan jalan</malay> [lah] so like <malay>senang</malay>
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and <malay>pergi</malay> the pedestrian pathway <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang pun</malay> singapore drivers
<malay>memang semacam</malay> [ah]
blind blind spot
(err) talking about check back blind spot <malay>tadi</malay> on the way here already I was I was really know I was
I I think I might feel fail someone from the the the I was like on the road going junction then there's a light then on my left is the zebra crossing [ah]
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on (um) from the main road going straight so <malay>dia dari</malay> the the the other side <malay>nak masuk</malay> the main road from the zebra crossing [ah] the junction so the
the driver <malay>dia tak nampak</malay> [ah] I like I was really prepared to break from <malay>jauh</malay> but I was already <malay>dah macam dah nak</malay>
I was really like to be beside her in that main road <malay>dia</malay> just jam break [ah] then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like <malay>dia</malay> not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her [ah]
[ah]
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour <malay>boleh nampak apa dari jauh</malay> then like there was a car like
there was no nothing no one else on the road on the road was me
I mean but
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't <malay>tak ternampak tak nampak</malay> so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break [ah]
so she just she jam break herself [ah] then just I hear <malay>dia cakap</malay> sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her [lah]
[oh] ya (err) so <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm taking my bike license [lah] like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
you license [ah] you
I mean it's a good thing for a license [lah] you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are <malay>dari</malay> the cyclists [ah] you are like basically the food chain [ah] <malay>kat bawah sekali</malay>
so you know how the the most dangerous thing so now you technically you will go out [ah] as a motorcyclist style more car then you will like maybe can put yourself in other shoe [ah]
[ah] <malay>tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh</malay>
ya like I think then I think the instructor <malay>pun cakap</malay> you because some people <malay>dah dia dah ada</malay> three A license of the three class three three license
then they <malay>dia orang nak ambil</malay> class two B then they then I think they instructor <malay>pun cakap</malay> [ah] you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but <malay>sekarang nak nak naik</malay> motor then now you know <malay>orang</malay> motor <malay>apa yang jadi</malay> so just now I was doing practical [lah] I did revision but then I think what reason <malay>siang sangat</malay> because
like <malay>cepat sangat</malay> [ah] because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
so I think
(uh) prac five is the revision [dah] I mean it's the internal cost [lah] but I already cleared that just that I did revision because <malay>dah lama tak naik</malay> motor
six <malay>kat luar</malay>
but before that defensive riding [lah]
[oh] you mean <malay>keluar</malay> from the to the main road [ah] yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also <malay>naik basikal</malay> so I can see <malay>apa yang</malay> or like what's happening [ah] <malay>kata orang</malay> too happening [sia] I also <malay>macam takut</malay> [ah] <malay>nak nak nak nak keluar</malay> that main road just to <malay>naik basikal</malay>
so
ya
but I think I
I because I choose #ubi# <malay>pasal pun</malay> like <malay>dekat dengan basikal</malay> so I think I I mean <malay>naik basikal sana</malay> okay [lah] I don't want to <malay>naik basikal</malay> every time go pevery time go
ya
no
ya
I mean <malay>aku pun</malay> don't mind [lah] <malay>kena</malay> ride on some something ride on me but
depends [lah] so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay [lah] once in a while occasion so like how <malay>aku naik naik basikal sini</malay> to to here then also I need to go back <malay>naik basikal</malay> so depends [lah] but then <malay>nak</malay> every time <malay>nak</malay> take lessons no thanks [ah]
I will just take public but then now <malay>pasal nak dekat</malay> so I <malay>naik basikal</malay> to [jer] [lah]
<malay>dua puluh enam dua puluh enam</malay> the practical like depends [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
thirty six when it comes to revision outside or the the the test outside is sixty or so around fifty plus
six or five
ya
I mean <malay>basikal pun</malay> okay for exercise like I mean comes to <malay>dapat</malay> motor <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] you
like for transportation because now also <malay>tengah</malay> like <malay>belajar pun</malay> like easy [lah] like <malay>boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik</malay> public <malay>abeh</malay> public <malay>tempat penuh sangat</malay> then you cannot sit down <malay>terus macam</malay>
<malay>dah malas nak pergi sekolah</malay>
I don't know [lah] I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always <malay>macam</malay>
I I I don't know [lah] <malay>macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik</malay>
singapore I <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is (err) I mean reliable just that I don't know why [ah]
I was I <malay>rasa kubur-kubur dan kena</malay> you dug up the <malay>kubur</malay> then underground then <malay>hantu dah semua datang</malay>
I I think the bike I'm looking for is (err) the one like my friend is riding I think one five zero or one five
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike <malay>kat sana</malay> is one sixty
I don't know [ah] I want to <malay>jimat duit pun</malay> okay [lah] but then I want to <malay>nak</malay> like I mean <malay>nak nampak</malay> handsome <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] so
<malay>tak</malay> handsome <malay>sangat</malay> [lah]
ya like [ah] <malay>muka aku pun buruk sangat</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> <malay>pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi</malay> at least <malay>kalau</malay> at least I from a seven maybe <malay>masuk naik atas ke</malay> nine <malay>ke</malay> eight <malay>ke</malay> all over there [ah]
ya ya okay that one I
you <malay>pandai juga</malay> [eh] motor <malay>kau</malay>
I I don't even know what
those brands are like [ah] because I think the one that everybody using that have been recommending me fuel efficient is the I mean somewhat fuel efficient is one five zero [ah]
I think when I think <malay>kalau nak beli</malay> motor <malay>pun</malay> I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe (uh) as a second second owner [ah] not gonna buy until <malay>dah nak habis</malay> maybe maybe
seven more years or seven seven or seven more years [ah]
<malay>kalau ada duit</malay> of course obviously I will buy [ah] like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out [ah] like
like I I need to decide first whether because like if I were to do my work
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like that's because I would be <malay>macam jauh</malay> away from singapore ya like for <malay>enam bulan</malay> so I think see how first [lah]
ya
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing [lah] <malay>ada ada datang balik terus</malay> the tyre <malay>hilang tinggal</malay> handlebar [jer] <malay>kat sana</malay> but park <malay>kat</malay> carpark <malay>tinggal</malay> handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing [lah] but
[ah] I so that's why I need to see first most probably <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] most probably I just comeback
I just keep renting [ah] depends on like what bike I want then
then (uh) I think most probably I will still <malay>nak ambil</malay> class three three license [lah] I mean
I mean we (err) like (uh) <malay>nak buat</malay> family cannot be bringing your child <malay>kalau ada</malay> child <malay>naik naik naik</malay> motor [pe] I means still can [lah] but then like cannot [lah] like but singapore I mean were asking if want to <malay>naik naik</malay> bus [pe] public but then
like when it comes to reliability <malay>macam barang-barang selalu</malay> breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
!aiya! I think that one too vague [lah] like everything can be improve [lah] <malay>semua benda boleh boleh</malay> improve [pe] <malay>ada benda merepek pun boleh</malay> improve
so <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much [ah] <malay>nanti benda</malay> problem <malay>nanti</malay> then you are relying that thing <malay>benda rosak</malay> then you are
like at the at the like a dead end
so <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] so that one also cannot rely too much [lah]
[oh] ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn [ah] <malay>berbual</malay> for I mean this conversation we are having so
what was the question I have to remember [oh] was it something like okay what is the
which (um) the surprise <malay>yang paling besar yang orang</malay> like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
ya ya yes yes
freighter then I noticed the mere driver was my one of my teammates
[oh] so like [ah] okay okay so <malay>duduk lama-lama</malay> then suddenly you just don't know either <malay>dia orang datang</malay> so they put your car then what happen next
(um)
so we basically <malay>dah kereta</malay> you just waiting waiting then <malay>dia orang dah sampai tempat</malay> pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park [lah] so then after that <malay>dia orang nak bawa</malay> to the place to eat [lah] so and so <malay>tempat makan dia</malay> at where exactly
okay now let's understand so <malay>siapa</malay> like you who <malay>siapa</malay> who was there like <malay>siapa kat sana semua</malay> like is it your all your soccer mates [ah] is it just them or <malay>ada orang lain</malay> celebrating
okay [lah] I mean ya I mean the also quite <malay>gerek</malay> [lah] but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday [ah] <malay>orang</malay> like you are with [lah] people you love <malay>orang kalau kawan</malay> help your family depends like everyone like <malay>ada orang macam nak</malay> celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves <malay>tak nak orang</malay> involved
like
everybody <malay>orang</malay> celebrate differently [ah] so I think it's good [lah] like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want [ah] <malay>ada</malay> some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite <malay>dia padahal dia tak nak</malay> celebrate they are just <malay>nak lepak kat rumah</malay>
<malay>nak tidur tu</malay> [jer] so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want [ah]
so
my birthday present I think honestly now
just <malay>kasih duit</malay> [jer] I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff [ah] I think like [ah] you give me <malay>duit</malay> I I can spend myself you give me a voucher <malay>kat</malay> also I happy <malay>dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah</malay>
so I think that will be is enough <malay>untuk</malay> like for me [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
I mean it's good [lah] you like your friends chip in everything for <malay>barang-barang</malay> for you
so I think
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting [lah] like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are [eh] <malay>apa</malay> like what is happening and like
<malay>tengah buat apa ni</malay> what they doing [sia] you are <malay>dalam dalam hati</malay> is just <malay>takut tapi</malay> it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say [ah] <malay>duit</malay> vouchers are a good thing [ah] like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just <malay>orang</malay> just acquaintances you just <malay>tanya</malay> the mutual friend like [eh] <malay>apa dia suka</malay> [ah] like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>pergi</malay> shopping rather you maybe buy a like get (err) voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also <malay>tak</malay> shopping <malay>banyak sangat</malay>
and ya I think the typical <malay>barang</malay> for guy is <malay>orang kasih apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kasih</malay> those perfume I guess the the they demo <malay>apa lagi</malay> (uh) they don't call it perfume <malay>dia orang panggil apa</malay> [eh] [oh] cologne [ah] cologne but I mean
I don't know [lah] <malay>jangan nak nak</malay> step <malay>atas cakap</malay> perfume <malay>sudah</malay> [lah] for me [lah] okay but
(err) <malay>tapi</malay> ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch [lah] like <malay>senang</malay> [ah] unless <malay>orang dia macam</malay> those (uh) <malay>yang benda benda</malay> the all the watches <malay>dia dah dah dah ada</malay> rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course [lah] <malay>tak payah fikir pasal tu</malay>
[ah] ya
I mean I am okay grand if it's just the person that I want
even grand but then <malay>orang orang orang siapa</malay> [seh] <malay>ni aku tak berbual</malay> then <malay>terus</malay> it's like
it's like (err) it's like [eh] [ah] like awkward [lah] you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand [lah] so so <malay>orang kalau fikir</malay> okay invite <malay>orang lebih lebih padahal</malay> you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself <malay>tak payah tak payah</malay> no need to hide your personality <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
ya [lah] I mean but like honestly
okay that is I mean birthdays [lah] but then it's like I mean to me you <malay>fikir fikir</malay> birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like <malay>apa</malay> that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person [lah] <malay>dah dah dah tua dah lama</malay> or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
like like what you say [lah] or whatever if the person has done but then ya [lah] but
like you have to know what the person like intention of what a birthday is [lah] for me
okay whatever you said that one <malay>orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat</malay> like you I mean like birthday birthday [ah]
<malay>tak payah nak</malay> (mm) <malay>susah sangat</malay> like what you said <malay>kalau orang nak</malay> book <malay>tempat pun</malay> as a as an example <malay>kalau</malay> the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december <malay>orang orang</malay> confirm like it's gonna be fully book [lah] so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya [lah] there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday <malay>nak barang-barang semua yang bagus</malay> [ah] like I mean for a celebration [lah] it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays [ah] once in a lifetime [ah] you can you are gonna be that age for once only (uh) unless (err) I don't know <malay>percaya</malay> reincarnation that one different topic [lah]
okay (uh) (uh) ya I guess that's <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dah nak</malay> they by their by their age
they have to know [lah] like like it's not gonna be feasible [lah] for the rest of their life if they wanna do something like often but then with his once in lifetime you let people celebrate their twenty first birthday something grand then like okay [lah] whoever their close friends planning gonna plan like really
<malay>jauh</malay> [lah] like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december [ah] then you have to book very early but then
<malay>banyak banyak</malay> hotel <malay>pun nak</malay> book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating [ah]
so I think when it comes to birthday it's like all ultimately is do you want to grand or not
okay [lah] ya I mean ya [lah] I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya [lah] COVID <malay>sekarang buat</malay> everything <malay>susah</malay> even
not even just <malay>nak keluar</malay> holiday like <malay>nak keluar untuk kerja</malay> overseas is like the deployment <malay>kat</malay> overseas is <malay>orang semua susah susah</malay> is like now everybody <malay>kena</malay> in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this <malay>apa apa</malay> this career <malay>dia orang tengah buat</malay> is on hold <malay>pasal</malay> of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point [lah] not just birthdays [ah] so like all other like holidays or even like work [ah] <malay>kerja kerja</malay> critical this is a it's like a
a good (err) thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened [lah] so like <malay>orang</malay> can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect [ah] like in the future is this [ah] like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead <malay>jauh jauh lain</malay> [ah]
I mean the furthest I went <malay>paling jauh</malay> is U like the I went to that was <malay>bila kecil-kecil</malay> [ah] los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember <malay>apa yang</malay> I did
but I think when it comes to like if I were to choose a place to go out maybe not just birthday [lah] a holiday or something [eh]
I think I will most probably do something
like maybe like if
like I would think or maybe going to east west of like of the like a road trip or just maybe just like go japan north to south that's that's what I would do [lah] a road trip
I mean it helps [lah] you you got you like you already plan [lah] <malay>nak pergi</malay> okay okay I want <malay>aku nak pergi jepun</malay> so I want to like at least <malay>belajar</malay> a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
#taberu# <malay>makan</malay> like like all those [ah] keyword like #taberu# <malay>makan</malay> and [ah] #coco desuka# like <malay>ni nak pergi</malay> (err) like go where <malay>nak pergi mana</malay> go where some something like that [lah] so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard [lah] <malay>nak cari makan makanan</malay> halal but then
I mean <malay>yang</malay> the big staple food there is you can just I mean <malay>minta</malay> so I guess <malay>ikan</malay> sushi <malay>nasi</malay> and one
I mean #hokkaido# no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only #yokohama# that [eh] no [oh] no #tokyo# is <malay>lagi tinggi dari</malay> #yokohama# so no that's the highest I've been is to #tokyo# so but
I think #hokkaido# <malay>tempat tempatnya</malay> ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff [ah] <malay>benda-benda</malay> cream is usually <malay>benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk</malay> I mean that that that latitude <malay>tinggi-tinggi pun memang</malay> understandable [lah] so ya I mean #hokkaido# is when it comes to <malay>makanan tempat benda sejuk</malay> [lah] dessert
I think it's not also just that [lah] I mean you also <malay>tempat</malay>
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also <malay>dia orang pun cantik juga</malay> I mean their complexion is there <malay>tempat pasal</malay> there <malay>tempat sejuk</malay> if it's cold then you don't really sweat much <malay>tempat</malay> so it depends [ah]
I mean that's understandable [lah] you see <malay>orang-orang yang mat salleh orang</malay> those <malay>memang</malay> the further north
further like whiter they are I mean and when it comes to nearer to the equator you gonna be much more darker [lah] it's I think that one is like it has been for so long already and just that now people are more migrating more so it's a different more complexion
but the percentage point <malay>tak tinggi sangat</malay> [lah] so it's ya [lah] I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends [ah]
honestly I think it's a waste of money <malay>orang</malay> like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just <malay>takut</malay> [eh] <malay>orang</malay> also <malay>pergi</malay> then I never <malay>pergi</malay> it's like I cannot talk about it [sial] <malay>berbual abeh</malay> then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that <malay>dia orang dah pergi</malay> so that can talk
[oh]
okay ya so ya [lah] I mean wait this six hundred is a lot [lah] so
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot <malay>untuk nak anuh dah</malay> just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>orang nak belanja</malay> then up to them

which <malay>pada aku</malay> is just (uh) not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to <malay>macam</malay>
a bad woman [ah] basically
<malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> not all <malay>aku tak cakap yang</malay> all beautiful ladies
<malay>perempuan lawa</malay> is basically <malay>jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau katakan</malay> [eh] like ninety per cent
ninety per cent

I mean you can judge a person based on <malay>dia punya</malay> personality first <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> most of the time they judge on looks
just because <malay>dia tak lawa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu</malay>

like last time people is more of a <malay>macam</malay> loyal [tau] <malay>sekarang</malay> is more of K [ah]
(mm) what you mean
ya attention <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> they need attention [ah]
because now is <malay>kita</malay> living in a modern society [tau] so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with <malay>faham</malay>
and we need to work and we need to think about this and that
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>rabak gila</malay>
that's why they need attention as like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) pleasure
not (uh) pleasure [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
[ah] they need attention because they are young [ah] basically
<malay>kalau</malay> married couple for me <malay>kalau nak</malay> attention is very hard [ah]
for you to get attention if both are working most of (uh) most of the adults now you see is both working [what]
ya is have to
<malay>tapi kalau nak cakap</malay> [kan] [eh] (um)
<malay>aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku</malay> attention <malay>tapi kita</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you're not [ah] giving both
both of like both of your life a chance [tau]
like
<malay>kau nak selalu cakap</malay> I need attention <malay>tapi</malay> you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things <malay>apa</malay>
that's why you're married because you trust each other
<malay>kau faham tak aku cakap</malay>
is it
no [ah] <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> piece together all of it [kan] is <malay>susah juga pasal</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> is more like <malay>kita</malay> have different thoughts different feelings <malay>kita punya</malay> emotions all jumble up
basically
<malay>jadi kita</malay> [ah]
and singapore [eh] <malay>kalau kau nak tahu</malay> [eh] singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world [tau] serious
because of the stress that <malay>macam kita</malay> put on ourselves just to survive every month
that is quite harsh [lah] harsh reality [ah]
and singapore [eh] have the <malay>macam</malay> the highest divorce rate
one of the highest [ah] divorce rate in the world
mostly <malay>melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's very hard [lah] because nowadays more of like <malay>dia orang</malay> (um)
they never think
<malay>dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan</malay> [tau]
they <malay>fikir</malay> okay <malay>macam orang putih cakap</malay> yolo [eh]
you only live once [kan] so they never think <malay>macam</malay> [ah] beyond horizon [tau]
<malay>dorang just fikir</malay> okay (uh) <malay>aku nak</malay> party [ah] all the way but <malay>dia nak kena fikir juga</malay>
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going <malay>macam</malay> downhill [ah]
[kan]
so <malay>pada aku</malay> wise [eh] <malay>nak cakap sekarang punya zaman</malay> is more stress [lah] basically
<malay>tapi yang penting</malay> [eh] <malay>daripada</malay> drama <malay>boleh pergi</malay> marriage

I mean like is like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) a playhouse [tau]

without any mistakes [ah] [kan] like
<malay>kau boleh buat</malay> mistake <malay>tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi</malay> it's (uh) it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse [kan]

<malay>abeh</malay>
I think total <malay>macam dua belas orang</malay> [ah] so they <malay>dorang</malay> like they need a cut off to go to the second one

I don't know what to call it [lah] like they hamburger but the bun part
the capsule [ah] ya that [one] <malay>susah</malay>
because you need like the right shape the right (uh) rise and then
like the <malay>apa ni dia nya</malay> height
<malay>abeh</malay> then you need to like coat it
make sure it doesn't break
[oh] [a'ah] <malay>korang</malay> exam
okay [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like the past (mm) <malay>dua minggu tiga minggu macam kat rumah kat dalam bilik macam</malay>
like you don't feel like you fulfil anything like that
<malay>kau ada buat</malay>
did you do
<malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh] <malay>dekat rumah</malay> chloe [eh]
!alah! <malay>dorang dua</malay> neighbour
<malay>padahal aku pergi sana entah buat apa</malay>

<malay>abeh dorang tiga tengah sibuk dengan dorang punya</malay> coffee
<malay>abeh aku sorang</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak tahu cukup</malay> bro
mac and cheese [ah] circuit breaker mac and cheese I did in one week I did four attempts
I think my best was still the third one [lah] but
like I didn't cook a lot <malay>macam</malay> I cook a bit just for myself just to see <malay>apa ni</malay>
whether it's good or not [lah] like the combination <malay>tapi macam</malay> all four <malay>macam</malay> not that
fantastic [eh] [eh] actually ya
ya it's the amount
<malay>berapa banyak</malay> then the low heat
<malay>tapi yang</malay> actually <malay>susah</malay> singapore mac and cheese is the type of cheese
<malay>macam susah nak cari</malay>
my first one was I think white and
my first and second was white and orange the cheddar
the slice <malay>punya</malay> [ah] <malay>abeh</malay> the third one I went to
find the
cheese
<malay>aku tak ingat</malay> [ah] <malay>aku beli</malay> Cold Storage <malay>kat kedai tu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> Cold Storage <malay>yang</malay> Fairprice Finest <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dia ada aku beli</malay> [jer] [ah]
confirm I cannot remember <malay>nya</malay>
really [ah] but actually like the whole time
<malay>korang masak</malay> like during is like not really
<malay>masakan melayu</malay> kind
so that time I tried my <malay>nenek</malay> then I just ask
what was it [ah] some <malay>sambal</malay>
can't remember I think was like <malay>ayam masak merah</malay>
then end up the only thing <malay>yang aku ingat</malay> [kan] is like there already <malay>aku masak</malay> #tom yum# <malay>nasi goreng</malay> #tom yum# [seh]
like <malay>korang korang masak</malay> is like
like <malay>ikut</malay> measurement <malay>berapa sudu</malay> all those kind of thing
then when my <malay>nenek masak</malay> then she <malay>ajar</malay> right then she just like [oh] <malay>ambil sikit ambil sikit ni ni ambil lagi banyak abeh ni lagi sikit</malay> then I <malay>macam</malay> stress [sia] I don't even remember what is <malay>sikit</malay> what is <malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>ikut rasa</malay>
that's why part <malay>ramadhan susah nak masak</malay>
so end up <malay>macam nak masak sayur pun</malay> depends on the age of the <malay>sayur</malay> that kind of hing

okay [lah] but I never actually ask how much they spend that time <malay>aku punya kawan pun kahwin</malay>
then like even lesser people came
then I think <malay>dia nya masak pun</malay> is <malay>dorang masak sendiri</malay>
<malay>dorang tak</malay> order cater <malay>tak</malay> I don't think is cater that wasn't cater <malay>pasal tak banyak orang datang</malay>
like they didn't invite a lot [lah] but then it's <malay>kat</malay> Zoom
then they like she invite <malay>kawan pun</malay> like secondary school just me and another person
then she invite like two of her poly friends <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] then her bridesmaids [lah]
so it's like even as the bride herself <malay>dia tak</malay> invite <malay>banyak orang</malay>
okay [ah] but now <malay>banyak dorang</malay>
as in the company <malay>dorang buat</malay> is like cater <malay>hantar rumah</malay> [pe]
like the thing like that like that that time that #mariam# <malay>punya mak</malay>

hello my name is #hady#
hello #faidil# (um) how have you been
(um) !wow! that sounds great <malay>aku</malay> past few days <malay>aku tak buat apa-apa yang menarik sangat aku cuma duduk dekat rumah</malay> [jer] <malay>tengok</malay>
<malay>adik-beradik aku tengah belajar bapa aku kerja kawan aku semua sibuk dia kerja tengah dekat sekolah</malay>
so ya I haven't been out too much lately but I hope it will change in the next few days
okay so I have (um) the first question for you my first question is (um) just the other day I was walking outside (um) an apple store at white sands shopping mall
and I was looking inside and I saw they were selling this new phone [ah] that apple just released I think probably about a month or two ago retailing about maybe eight hundred nine hundred dollars plus
and I went into the store and I took a look at the phones and I was just comparing it with the old models and I didn't actually notice much of a significant difference in the looks and I read up on the performance not that much of a difference and I was just asking myself (um) I was wondering why would people fork out such huge amount of money for phone that is so insignificant in its performance or visuals compared to its (um)
previous models I just wanted to know your thoughts on that
(um) for me I would one hundred percent say with certainty that I do not think that phones in general should be retailing at four digits like one thousand dollars personally
I like to think that anything above five hundred dollars really is more of a luxury rather than the necessity
and I personally think that there are way more quality phones that you can get the super underrated for less than five hundred dollars and I think it's quite sad to see a company like apple maybe take advantage of maybe hardcore users by simply releasing phones that
are way out of the average person's price range and
I feel like it's obviously a bit sad to see from where it came from from the past years and you know these phones that come in at four digits are not really much to brag about in terms of any innovation that it possesses compared to maybe an iphone that came out two to three years ago and I'll be personally disappointed if I was a fan of apple and see with what they come up with
and I just think that since phones are such a necessity in our daily lives I feel like a one should strive
to aim for a balanced price range versus a top quality performance of a iphone
so ya I mean
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>janganlah kita buang duit nak beli</malay> handphone <malay>yang mahal-mahal tapi tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>beza sangat dengan</malay> handphone <malay>yang lama</malay> [kan]
so ya that's my opinion
(um) my second question for you is the past few days the weather in singapore has been really hot
and with (err) the importance of us wearing mask outside with COVID going on how have you been coping with the blazing weather so far
[ah] ya for sure I agree
it's crazy to see what the weather is like nowadays you think that living in singapore for twenty years you get adjusted to the humid weather but it seems that everyday it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and obviously we can attribute it to
whatever you know the climate or climate change or you know but I do agree that I think the only way that we can you know try to battle this weather is to stay hydrated keep drinking lots of water and try to get to cool places as often as you can don't stay out in the heat for your own sake
(um) ya and please don't forget to wear your mask cause for the wellbeing of the people around us
and my next question for you is what is one thing that you wish was free
(um) ya (um) that I totally agree with you
I can empathise with with having friends who (um) don't have great vision and seeing them fork out a few hundred dollars on something that they need
which is the spectacles and obviously is not going to be easy for everyone to afford you know cause
obviously spectacles are very expensive although it is a necessity and if I had one thing that I wish was free I would say something along similar lines I'd say I wish that healthcare was free
cause it's as a person who has been to hospital trips a few times and I've seen the amount of money that not just me but maybe the people around me have to fork out
just to pay their hospital bills and obviously in singapore is I'm very thankful that the government helps us a lot in subsidies but obviously healthcare is also important in singapore first first class
hospitals here and first class treatment and I guess can't take for granted the subsidies that the government gives but
mostly <malay>kalau aku boleh mimpi</malay> [lah] <malay>satu hari</malay> healthcare <malay>percuma</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk semua orang</malay>
<malay>sebab orang tua mungkin yang sudah kerja lama sudah mungkin sudah pencen ke</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang nak</malay> afford <malay>untuk bayar dia orang punya</malay> hospital bills [kan]
<malay>nenek saya pun masuk</malay> hospital <malay>pun dah beberapa dah beberapa kali pasal sakit pasal jatuh</malay>
<malay>pun tak murah</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>nak bayar dia punya itu</malay>
my parents have to fork out some cash and my parent's siblings have to fork out some cash (um) just to be able to afford and you know help chip in
so in an ideal world if I could ask for one thing to be free I would say free healthcare for everybody regardless of who they are what their salaries status is
(mm) yes
(um) that's a good question something that I've thought about since I was a young kid as well I'm sure everybody has thought of it and been asked at some point if I could have one superpower it I guess I have to go with (um) the superpower of invisibility
and I think it would be pretty obvious why (um) I think it be pretty cool to be running around and nobody sees where or who you are
I can just board the plane and get past custom without anybody seeing me you know can travel anywhere I want
so ya I I think I'll be a pretty good criminal if I had the invisibility superpower you know it's just I think it'll be pretty fun to say the least
(um) obviously as of right now I don't think it's possible for anybody to be invisible so you know who knows maybe one day in the future <malay>kita boleh hilangkan diri</malay> [eh] in a way that
nobody can see us and obviously I hope for it to be
(um) temporary rather than permanent cause I still want to see my parents
I don't want to be invisible without them seeing me that'll be that'll be pretty bad I'd say what about you
I mean ya that's that sounds great to be honest (um) mind reading (um) I'm sure everybody has wanted to do it
<malay>kalau aku pun aku memang nak</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab macam dia kata kalau</malay> during exams <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>masa</malay> O level <malay>aku boleh baca minda orang</malay> [eh] <malay>yang duduk depan aku itu budak pandai itu kalau aku boleh baca minda dia mana tahu aku punya</malay> results <malay>lagi bagus daripada sekarang ke</malay>
(um)
ya <malay>betul-betul boleh baca minda kawan</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dia tengah tipu ke kalau dia tengah jujur ke tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau orang ini berbual merepek ke</malay> you know I mean I guess mind reading is I'd say is pretty powerful to be honest but who knows maybe someday
we can have any planted tube inside our brain you know where we can access one another but I guess for my own personal reasons I wouldn't want people reading my mind you know
I'm sure you agree
(um) ya of course my next question to you is if you can instantly master three skills
what would be the three skills and why
[ah] ya before I say the three skills I master I (um) I agree with your last point about being able to
(um) be friends with everybody cause as an introvert
I often see myself having maybe a bit of trouble maybe a bit of shyness trying to
interact with the people around me although at the same time it makes me treasure
whatever friends I have now more than anything I have in the world
and right now the three skills that I'd master
<malay>yang pertama</malay> if <malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay>
<malay>dapat cepat-cepat belajar apa-apa bahasa dalam dunia</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab pertama sekali</malay> (um) <malay>daripada kecil dulu pergi kelas madrasah selalu dapat dan sudah dapat belajar bahasa arab tapi sampai sekarang pun masih tak boleh</malay> (err) <malay>nak cakap satu ayat pun dalam bahasa arab sebab berapa susah nak belajar</malay>
so <malay>kalau ada peluang bahasa arab</malay>
<malay>bahasa perancis bahasa espanyol</malay>
<malay>bahasa</malay> german <malay>dengan</malay> italian
<malay>aku kalau boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cuba</malay>
(um) master [lah] <malay>dengan beberapa cepat</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kedua kalau boleh saya nak</malay>
(um) <malay>belajar masak dengan betul-betul baik</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> #faidil# <malay>kata tadi dia boleh</malay> look up to <malay>orang macam</malay> gordon ramsay <malay>yang memang hebat sekali bila masak tapi kalau saya saya tak</malay>
<malay>ikut</malay> [lah] gordon ramsay <malay>kalau boleh pun saya nak ikut emak saya sahaja sebab dia memang satu inspirasi bagi saya dan</malay>
<malay>kalau saya dah ada berumahtangga kalau ada bini ke saya tak nak bini saya tanggung semua tanggungjawab untuk masak untuk kita dan anak-anak kita</malay> so
<malay>mana tahu dua tiga minggu sekali saya boleh nak memasak untuk anak kita dan iya</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat senangkan untuk semua orang</malay>
the third skill that I would like to master is probably
(hmm)
I think I would say
being able to master just learning anything as quickly as possible and obviously it sounds more vague I mean I'd say anything cause obviously in life you will come across a lot of challenges and a lot of new experiences and
I think it would be great if I could just learn anything at hand just instantaneously cause
obviously I don't want to fall behind and you know let's say I enter the workforce and and (um) you know there's something new to be learned or something new to be
to be found out then I guess I would like to be able to learn it as quickly as possible
just for the for my own benefit
and moving on my next question to you is
do you watch and if so what genre of do you watch
from ya I mean ya actions sounds great (um) I I also want to ask you what what kind of movies or shows do you watch regarding that topic
maybe
dwayne the rock johnson maybe
(um) ya that I mean I mean I'm not personally I'm not a big fan of action myself I think I would rather access my emotions cause my favourite
genre of
or movies I'd say is definitely romance cause I'm a bit of a softie myself so I like to cry
some of my favourite shows or movies of romance I'd say for shows I would go with master of none starring #aziz ansari#
it's really great it really got me in my feelings
for movies there's a lot but I name my top three I'd say number three I would say maybe (um) five hundreds days of summer
starring (um) zoey deschanel number two maybe I'd say her starring joaquin phoenix and number one I'd say lala land starring emma stone and ryan gosling
movie romantic <malay>ini memang aku suka</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini</malay> I mean <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kalau aku nangis</malay> [kan] <malay>memang dapat rasa emosi dia</malay> [lah] <malay>bila tengok orang berlakon</malay>
<malay>tapi macam drama-drama melayu pun banyak dekat</malay> <malay>tiga ke</malay> malaysia astro <malay>ke dapat tengok</malay>
<malay>kebanyakkan cerita romantis kelakar</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>memang aku suka</malay> [lah]
<malay>dengan</malay> (um) <malay>iya</malay> [lah] I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to [ah]
obviously any movie starring the rock and kevin hart
those are absolute blockbuster movies and they always live up to their names
(um) ya and
regarding the questions about I'd say in this generation maybe is not quite the medium where we watch movies nowadays I think most of us would want to watch it on our phones
or maybe on a tablet where it's easier to access I mean obviously it's a shame to see dying out but
ya this is the new medium and most of us have already adjusted to it
I I agree I personally myself for romance movies I
my favourite movie itself indeed it's not the ending is not the cliche of
other like other romantic movies in fact the ending it's not cliche itself was the reason why I was crying so much cause it was so unexpected
so ya I mean it's hard to pick out something that is so good and and maybe a genre that is so saturated with just plain jane movies that we seen over and over again
and so now my next question to you is along the lines of and movies if you could become an actor or an actress who would it be
(um) ya johnny depp is indeed a fantastic actor who doesn't love pirates of the carribean right well personally I would say if I could become an actor I would
want to become ryan gosling
obviously cause he is in my favourite movie lala land acting with my favourite actress emma stone
so you know if I could take his place that will be pretty sweet and I mean the guy has acted in quite a lot of great movies like nice guys and and I guess his sense of humor and how he says it in a dead in a deadpan way
I kind of see his resemblance or my resemblance in him so ya I I like him
I mean I mean to be honest if one day I woke up as johnny depp (um) I won't be complaining to be honest but ya I guess johnny depp and ryan gosling personally really not
the same type of actor maybe
or maybe play the same type of movies
I mean you have your own opinions and I have my own taste [ah] so ya and to be honest I don't really care about who johnny depp dates to be honest
I I more of a fan of the movies that ryan plays so ya
I mean it'd be pretty sweet to wake up one day as a as a famous actor in hollywood
(um) my next question to you is
would you rather fight one
horse sized otter or one hundred otter sized horses personally I think I would rather fight just one horse sized otter cause
I think I don't think I can handle one hundred of something
and very small but you know it comes in pax so
I think I might get overwhelmed pretty quickly but
it's just a hypothetical and I just want to know what you think
thank you for agreeing with me and my next question to you is on the more sentimental a nostalgic note if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would have been inside that time capsule
<malay>kalau aku ada</malay> time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
<malay>kalau sepuluh tahun aku baru sembilan tahun baru masih budak sekolah darjah lagi</malay>
<malay>kalau aku aku letak mungkin beberapa gambar</malay>
<malay>aku dengan ibu bapa aku bila aku kecil lagi</malay>
<malay>jadi aku boleh iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>gambar-gambar tersebut</malay> [kan]
and <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak</malay> stress [kan] <malay>dalam hidup</malay>
<malay>kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa</malay> about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
if what else would I put inside I probably put in a few of my
xbox three sixty (um) console disc inside cause I have very fond memories of me playing games on my console when I got back from home
from primary school games like tiger woods tour maybe or maybe like
(um)
FIFA O nine or FIFA ten
where I would just everyday go home and play it carefreely
so
(um) ya [lah] (um)
just
I can't I can't really think of what else [lah] to put inside but
if I knew I'd agree with #faidil# as well
I would put in a note to myself I think it's like it's like what you said [lah] (um) I just
I just write to myself and
and just talk to myself about how life how great life was ten years ago
I I really wish I could go back in time [ah]
so ya that's what I would find inside my time capsule
do you have a question for me
okay sure I I will ask you the question (um) my next question is
if you had three wishes maybe for yourself for your family or you know you just for the whole world what will you wish for
that sounds like a pretty decent innovation
I I would definitely hope that
!whoa! <malay>memang menarik itu jawapan dia</malay>
I mean <malay>duit itu memang penting</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau aku aku pun nak duit</malay> [lah] <malay>seratus</malay> billion dollars <malay>itu memang</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau aku ada tiga</malay>
wishes
<malay>yang pertama</malay>
(um) <malay>dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang</malay>
<malay>aku akan</malay> wish <malay>untuk semua orang</malay>
<malay>dapat hidup dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> stable [ah] <malay>sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah</malay>
<malay>dunia ini pun semakin</malay> (um) <malay>semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk</malay> survive [kan]
so <malay>yang pertama</malay> I would wish for poverty to end cause
you live a cruel world and it's hard live without money so I just give an infinite amount of cash to
basically every single billion person in the world
you know just drop them a stack of cash so that they can
live a better life
my second wish would be (um) being the crazy football fan that I am I really wish I could own
chelsea football football club and cause I I really love football and I really love the club so it would be pretty cool to own the club [lah] cause I think that I can run the club better than its current owner and I think I have some pretty good ideas and on who to buy and
you know I can just give myself unlimited free tickets to watch the games so it's I think it's a pretty good package you know if I could ask for it and my third wish would be
(um) if I had a third wish I would just (um) in a cliche kind of answer I would wish for everybody to just have eternal happiness cause
it's hard to see your own friends or your own family be down sometimes
and even yourself so it's like it's
I mean obviously everybody goes through rough times but
it would be nice to see everybody live very happily (um) for until whenever
you know so ya that would be my three wishes I've heard yours
selfish
I mean ya (um) liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but <malay>aku rasa</malay> chelsea <malay>itu memang aku dah lama</malay> [lah] <malay>sokong</malay> so <malay>aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku</malay>
<malay>aku memang aku memang</malay> jealous [lah] <malay>yang</malay> liverpool menang title <malay>tahun lepas</malay>
<malay>tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku</malay> control chelsea <malay>sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan</malay> so <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar</malay> [lah] [eh]
and my next question to you is
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life
what would it be
(um) if I could have one dish for the rest of my life
<malay>aku akan pilih</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay>
<malay>masakan ibu</malay>
<malay>kegemaran</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>nasi</malay>
[eh] <malay>nasi pula lauk lemak</malay>
<malay>cili padi</malay>
<malay>sebab daripada dulu mak aku masak memanglah sedap gila</malay>
and <malay>aku</malay> and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
I mean I I take it as my meal for the rest of my life but
ya
I think
it's more of a sentimental dish rather than a dish of
you know something more extravagent like you know maybe a steak
maybe #wagyu# beef maybe
but no I would think my own mum's dish
is it a job that like any job I can choose
I would choose
I would take two jobs one job I would want to become an actor
in hollywood cause that's something that I always wanted to do
cause there's a lot of people I admire in the industry
(um)
<malay>yang kedua</malay>
<malay>kalau kalau boleh</malay> I want to become a journalist cause
I really like the work that they do and you know how they always (um)
the first people when the news breaks so
the first people to report on something new happens
I feel like the thrill of the job
is something that I can never get bored of
(um) (um)
there's always something satisfactory that I can look forward everyday
what about you
(um) !wow! (um) those three jobs sound great
and you know I will move on to the next question now
the next question is
good looks or a fake body
what would you prefer
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>memang sekarang ini banyak orang</malay>
<malay>betul betul betul betul</malay> judgemental [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay>
so <malay>kalau aku boleh pilih</malay>
<malay>kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat</malay> [lah]
<malay>daripada muka yang</malay> handsome [lah]
<malay>sebab sebagai seorang yang tak ada dua-dua</malay>
<malay>kalau aku boleh tukar aku punya rupa sekarang juga</malay>
<malay>aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada</malay>
<malay>nak cuba yang terbaik untuk</malay>
<malay>nampak lebih</malay>
<malay>lebih baik</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk orang lain</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi akhirnya juga</malay>
<malay>kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul</malay> handsome <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>atau kalau tak pun</malay>
<malay>saya rasa yang kita setuju yang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
I think would say that
a girl's personality is number one right
that's that's just what I think [lah] obviously everybody has their own preferences but if
I think if given a choice I would give a girl I would get a girl with a banging personality
over someone with a face like a a ten [lah] what about you
(um) ya of course personality is always number one
and obviously we cannot judge a person by what they look like judge a book by its cover you know
so ya
(um) !wow! (um) first of all
I
that is a surprising statistic personally
(um) I just why <malay>aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang</malay>
<malay>memang laju</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk senang kata</malay> [lah] <malay>memang laju memang banyak</malay> stress <malay>banyak yang nak buat</malay>
<malay>dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih</malay> stress
<malay>dan saya rasa</malay>
<malay>ini lebih kepada</malay>
culture <malay>di pada negara-negara di asia</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab iya</malay> [lah] <malay>benda macam</malay> (um) <malay>kesihatan</malay> mental <malay>ini memang</malay>
<malay>bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat</malay> [lah]
<malay>untuk ibu bapa</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita</malay> [kan] <malay>tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan</malay> mental <malay>sebagai sesuatu yang penting</malay> [lah]
and and I just think that maybe it's maybe it's a taboo for them to talk about it and maybe they are not as open to it as us and obviously suicide is just
is is a is a horrible way to end someone's their their own life and I I hope that anybody who goes through maybe a a depressive phase you know you know troubled times I really hope that they
would seek (um) a therapist or someone who is an expert to to help them cause it's it's always sad when you know someone who's taken their lives or just
<malay>macam dekat dalam berita yang ada orang bunuh diri dan</malay>
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but <malay>tak boleh</malay> so
it's just a waste of a life [ah] and what's your thoughts
(um) ya for sure (um) I feel like
(um) the awareness itself about mental health is very important (um) obviously in the past few years I think it's been way better now nowadays and as someone who knows somebody else who's who has anxiety who who has gone through depressive phase and knows about it I know about them I I myself am guilty of disregarding their feelings and just telling them to you know
get on with it you know and I as having been there and done that obviously I am very guilty and I feel bad about them cause cause and thankfully obviously they did not they did not end their own lives cause you know they manage to seek help but I guess I guess everybody
<malay>yang</malay> one way or another has been at fault
why you know has has been there when it comes to disregarding someone's else feelings and I think it's something that as a community I think we all can improve on
how about you #faidil#
[oh] should should I go first ya (um) first of all I'd say there's a lot that I am thankful for to be born in singapore (um) first of all
I'm very thankful that my parents have been able to live a stable life being here (um) I myself have been able to been raised up in a good community in a good place living in a block
(um) when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and <malay>memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada</malay> kindergarten <malay>sampai sekarang dekat sekolah</malay> poly <malay>ambil</malay> diploma
(um) <malay>dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada</malay> bill <malay>yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara</malay> (um) <malay>dekat sini pun</malay> (um) healthcare <malay>macam dekat</malay> polyclinic <malay>ke dekat</malay> hospital <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>kita punya apa dia kita punya</malay> government <malay>kita dapat tolong dapat</malay> cover [kan] <malay>dapat bantu</malay> and <malay>ada</malay> (um) as someone who has two siblings with special needs
and (um) and seeing what my parents have to work for just to be able to afford to send them to school to send them for their hospital meetings all and seeing the cost of it itself I'm very thankful that the government helps to cover and
I know my dad has never said it but I'm quite sure he is very thankful as well
and I I just hope that
me and the people around me will be able to work hard and just live a stable life in singapore
how about you #faidil#
(um) I also like to give a shoutout to all the nurses who work during the COVID (um) period we are also very thankful that they putting the hours everyday cause it's been a it's been crazy times for singapore for the whole world and it just I like to give my appreciation I'm sure my friend #faidil# feels the same way and with that I #faidil# thank you for talking to me today I'm sure we talk about a lot of stuff a lot of different stuff today did you have a good time

[ah] [ah]
okay
okay

okay right
so probably (err) I will start [lah]
so my question is regarding the wedding preparation
okay so from my understanding right <malay>apa tu</malay>
the <malay>kadi</malay> is you book the <malay>kadi</malay> from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them <malay>apa tu</malay>
directly [ah]
okay
okay
ya
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] it's okay [ah]
it's okay <malay>tak payah banyak-banyak</malay> then ya
(hmm)
[oh] okay <malay>jadi kalau kadi tu macam</malay> stay further but you select that <malay>kadi</malay> because you prefer also okay [lah] [oh]
(mm) okay
okay I see
okay okay
okay
(mm)
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
[oh] I see that means <malay>kalau</malay> if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
[oh]
[oh] I I I I <malay>takut</malay> what or not I <malay>takut</malay> go in [ah] then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend [kan] then is charges <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
okay
there there there is any amendment (err) there's there's charges [ah] ya
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> on that day is your date available already [lah] on the
[oh] haven't
ya
[oh] okay okay
[oh] I see so <malay>kirakan</malay> before the date available
you go in you select the <malay>kadi</malay> so (err) I mean you play with the form <malay>tapi</malay> you don't submit
[oh]
[oh] I I was thinking of doing that <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>macam takut</malay> #tersubmit# then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference [ah] the the charges [ah] and then ya so but I was also curious [ah] I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very (err) sought much sought sought after [lah] so don't want to make the mistake [ah] then that time you book <malay>masa tu nya</malay> (err) it's a sunday
<malay>mesti</malay> popular [kan] but then (err)
(err) how fast [ah] did did did sold out as in do you like wait the the night when the the date became available or you just wait the next day you submit
[oh]
okay
[ah]
<malay>takut tak dapat</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm) okay cause I also have to settle quite a number of things [ah] cause for #dewi# side [kan]
<malay>dia punya</malay> cause the dad is <malay>bukan</malay> is a non-muslim <malay>jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke</malay> I think <malay>sepuluh</malay> then
[oh] [oh]
[oh] I think about ten [ah] ya but <malay>dia ada lagi satu</malay> (err) <malay>punya susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> (um) <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak boleh apa tu</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau buat dekat</malay> (err) location <malay>lain</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> cannot be <malay>yang</malay> full time staff
so full time staff <malay>sana ada</malay> about <malay>tiga orang</malay> so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english [ah] so my (err) number of <malay>kadi</malay> shrink shrink then <malay>entah abeh sekarang</malay> nowadays I cannot see the <malay>kadi</malay> reviews on the web [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
but the the videos are removed ya so I like
so I also don't know but I know #salim jasman# I saw the video [lah] so I thought
he's okay he's fast I prefer <malay>pasal dia nya dia nya</malay> style is like
<malay>berbual sikit</malay> then go
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada satu</malay> (err) <malay>kadi tu dia</malay> quite quite
very eloquent [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> I <malay>tengok dia nya</malay> video [kan]
[ah] they they drag on
[ah]
ya ya (mm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
ya <malay>pasal sekarang</malay> I know <malay>yang satu kadi ni yang</malay> I identified this #salim jasman# I saw
<malay>cara dia buat macam betul</malay> relax [ah] (err) he just
(err)
I think he is not very particular as long as he can hear the person say and he just proceed
[oh] okay

(mm) okay (mm) (mm)
okay okay
[oh] okay okay

ya ya ya it sounds it sounds <malay>baku</malay> ya
ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga</malay> ya
(hmm) okay I see then ya
<malay>tapi yang kadi tu</malay> is your family <malay>punya</malay> (err) acquaintance [ah]
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> by then you don't know who that colleague is [lah]

<malay>cuma cuma dia punya masa tu</malay> thinking is <malay>dia nak pergi sana cepat</malay> so <malay>dia ada</malay> time to makeup [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) okay [oh] okay okay
for bride [lah] ya you <malay>dah</malay> plan [pe]
ya okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tu tak boleh jadi</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh</malay> [seh]
!huh! [oh]
<malay>kirakan sekarang ni macam</malay> they are <malay>macam</malay> (err) they messed up the (err) planning
some some some <malay>mak andam</malay> because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning [lah] okay
okay
okay <malay>dia</malay> panic [lah] okay
okay
<malay>kirakan</malay> flexible [lah] okay okay (uh huh)
(mm) <malay>jadi kirakan kalau macam</malay> if we do <malay>nikah</malay> and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether
okay
[oh] <malay>kirakan bukan pasal</malay> delay <malay>pasal</malay> they earn more [lah] no [lah] we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
<malay>tapi</malay> [oh] but you know how their charges are is like per whole [oh] not [oh]
but usually they won't try to delay unless really special occasion [ah] ya
okay
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> #prata# okay
a bit greasy [ah]
<malay>sakit perut</malay>
[oh] most of your friend also do at fort canning [ah]
okay
I see
okay <malay>jadi mak andam</malay> is not requirement unless you have (err) several outfit change
[oh] okay okay <malay>jadi sama</malay> [lah] I think for my side I think I don't want to have <malay>mak andam</malay> I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have (err) ya
(mm) but but she have no experience
true also
okay
okay
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah] cause you want what you want [lah] okay
okay
I I even thought of what you know because <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>katong sana</malay> [kan] there are many (err) salon ya then we thought (err) go there early ya
but that will be strange
(mm)
ya cause very close [eh] because <malay>yang</malay> grand mercure <malay>ada banyak</malay> salon ya how good [ah] that's why I have to go there okay
peranakan day [ah] so I think ya I have to go there early
ya <malay>dia pun</malay> I email <malay>juga</malay> (mm)
(mm)
okay so that part
ya I have to ask #dewi# to do research [lah] then from there
most likely we also will do the same thing [lah] <malay>kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi</malay> [ah] the day <malay>macam</malay> one off <malay>saja</malay> [lah]
[oh] okay <malay>mak andam</malay> is for rental cause they got special rate
ya [lah] and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding [mah]
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> of course photography on the same day is the best [lah] cheapest [ah] cheapest [lah] because you do makeup all that
[oh] okay so we do the <malay>nikah</malay> and the photography after that
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
(mm)
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause (err) lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
<malay>paling senang dekat dalam</malay> hotel <malay>tu tak boleh gerak-gerak</malay>
(mm) okay
ya
(mm) ya <malay>dia nya</malay> swimming pool I ever went it looks nice [lah] so I think I need to ask the person on that day
whether to see okay
(mm) we can go up and see [ah]
(mm)
<malay>bila</malay>
really [ah] you mean you all what wedding day
you want to book the hotel [oh] we thought of booking hotel for you all so
!huh! is
okay
lucky you tell me [eh] cause we really thought of booking for you all also then dinner we can go eat ya okay
okay ya okay ya let us know [lah] because we thought of (err) booking [lah] ya
okay
okay then ya so
three three (err) I think for for your case [kan] <malay>tiga jam macam</malay> okay [ah] very manageable
ya it's is very fast I like that
<malay>apa yang</malay> teething problems
I I know one problem that you all face is the
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem <malay>aku</malay> outside [mah] but I can see people no space sit ya
(mm)
!huh! [oh] they stay back [oh]
(mm)
<malay>pasal panas</malay> [oh] ya [lah] <malay>hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat</malay> (err) lawn <malay>tu</malay> mostly <malay>budak-budak</malay> parents <malay>semua tak pergi</malay> [seh] [ah]
yes yes I saw I saw it's quite (um)
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the <malay>nikah</malay>
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
for for my case okay [lah] <malay>terus</malay> settle
(um) but it's during the (err) the you you guys got the how is it how I can't remember the walk in [ah] how you guys did the walk
is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
[oh] then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again [ah]
cause for for (err) the place I have right there's a stage <malay>jadi kalau kirakan</malay> okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> start at eleven thirty
then everything finished at twelve thirty
[eh] wait [ah]
I remember is a eleven to three [ah] ya
okay
[ah] I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau apa tu</malay> like what you said
<malay>betul juga tapi</malay> wedding <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang macam</malay> panic [kan] <malay>jadi ada sikit</malay> problem <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma apa tu</malay>
(err)
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my <malay>nikah</malay> so
<malay>nikah</malay> plus (err) tea ceremony ya
that is the main main core concept
[oh] I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
ya [lah] <malay>siapa nak ikut</malay> to the letter [kan] yes
she don't care
yes
okay cause I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
[ah] that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
<malay>kirakan</malay> I want to like <malay>macam</malay> eleven thirty to one for example is <malay>nikah</malay> tea ceremony and then
that's also the time <malay>kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar</malay> [lah]
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about (err) one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty [ah] then whole lunch [ah] then in between before the one thirty starts right (err) we have the walk in [lah] then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans [lah] some activity [lah] so for about ya
okay <malay>tapi kalau</malay> COVID <malay>dia ada</malay> different kind of rules [ah] only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
(err) out of that twenty they have to be in their table [oh] but <malay>mungkin</malay> maybe <malay>masa tu</malay> policy <malay>belum</malay> start [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I went to the Grand Mercure right and (err)
#katong# and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
[ah]
<malay>tapi tapi kalau ada apa-apa nanti kena</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> COVID infection [ah]

sorry [ah] why why what happened
okay which man U game was that (mm)
[oh] I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
<malay>macam main bawah blok</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay> bro
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david #moyes# you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when #thiago# was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
[eh] anyway <malay>sekarang</malay> david #moyes# <malay>kat mana</malay> [siol]
[ah]
[oh] <malay>dia sekarang</malay> manage west ham [oh] west ham [eh] [ah] how did west ham do in their [oh] they lost against new castle
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games [ah]
am I right okay never mind (err) who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch [tau] it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw #thiago# go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
and you know we we've got these we've got these <malay>dia macam kau macam</malay> you just look at this guy
and you're like okay <malay>dah</malay> settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
(mm)
okay
(uh huh)
that philosophy [ah]
okay
the same louis #van gaal# were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
(mmhmm)
okay
ya
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
so that's why #mourinho# <malay>selalunya dia nya</malay> team (err) their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
I see
okay
!wow!
so he's like the empty football guy
(uh huh)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay that's that's the same school [ah]
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
just whack [ah] basically [ah]
[a'ah]
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
#klopp# and #mourinho# <malay>ni macam dorang macam</malay> opposite sides of the spectrum [ah] in a way [ah]

ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause (err)
raymond dominic actually like (uh) had a an argument with #anelka#
and <malay>macam pada</malay> #anelka# it was not fair [ah] like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
I got into Netflix cause of that #anelka# documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows [lah] but some like (err) okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai [ah]
okay so so so basically <malay>macam</malay> I've watched cobra kai I've watched (err) I mean I don't tend to watch the series [ah] I would watch like documentaries or <malay>macam</malay> movies [ah] so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting [ah]
(err) social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now (uh) it's about how <malay>macam</malay> Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> basically
<malay>dorang tahu</malay> like what attracts you what what you're interested in (uh)
so <malay>dorang buat macam</malay> (uh) and if not an avatar they like what do you call it [lah]
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like [oh] they sell the data
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like <malay>macam</malay> they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why <malay>macam</malay> Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation [ah]
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
[sia] [ah] why do they think this way [sia] <malay>asal dorang fikir macam gitu</malay> like <malay>dia</malay>
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
(uh) am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
<malay>kau</malay> how can people just support [sia] <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya [lah] usually it's either very insidious thingy [ah]
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like [oh] you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting [lah] like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it [lah] so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and (err) it's about how this guy (err) I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder (err) ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you [lah] but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town [lah] that he's in
[ah] it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean [ah] okay [lah] so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places [ah] one is (err) knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america (uh)
(err) K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so [ah] basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like <malay>macam</malay> lost his faith a bit [lah] cause one of the themes of the movie
is (err) you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that [lah]
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so (uh) and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then (err) and then and then and then
after he has a son of his own he starts to <malay>macam</malay> go back to
like worshipping god [ah] no <malay>macam macam</malay> it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>orang beragama pun macam</malay>
<malay>kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu</malay> that sort of thing so <malay>macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang</malay> for like five years <malay>lepas tu dia macam</malay> [eh] #astgahfirullah# <malay>aku kena qadak balik solat aku</malay>
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
ya so so so that's a tragedy <malay>macam</malay> something happens and then after that he he has this <malay>macam</malay> love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story (err)
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted [ah] I mean in the movie they they they
[ah] not not just inner demons [ah] I mean they are just they are evil people [ah] you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is [ah] robert pattison
you know that twilight fella [lah] !huh! ya the glittery vampire so <malay>dia yang sekarang</malay>
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something [kan]
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but [eh] but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show [ah]
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie [ah]
[ah] well he doesn't he doesn't molest children [ah]
okay shouldn't stereotype (err) pastor <malay>dorang</malay>
[a'ah]
okay
are you sure you want to say this on (err) are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box [ah]
okay [lah] so it's an [lah] it's not the Android box <malay>yang</malay> Android box <malay>yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada</malay> [kan] <malay>tu benda</malay> [kan]
[oh] is it
so basically it's an [lah]
okay okay
[ah]
[oh] is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya [lah] they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five [ah] it's like not not even [ah]
ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm)
[ah] ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl [kan]
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
(mm)
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that (uh) they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no [lah]
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's (uh) not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
(err) groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans [lah]
no he was in house of cards and and (err) house of cards the final season just <malay>macam tergantung macam gitu apa</malay>
because of this [ah] so
so I mean like in singapore #dee kosh# obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening <malay>mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang</malay> cause of all the
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
religious upbringing to say like [eh] <malay>ni benda salah</malay> [sia] what am I doing you know that sort of thing so <malay>macam</malay> I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no [lah] no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like <malay>macam</malay> it won't have been like once every few months [ah] which is the situation you find it you find now [ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
alright
[oh] my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through [ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
he's he's a good kid [ah]
okay
[a'ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
okay
<malay>dia panggil kau</malay> sir but <malay>asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau</malay> [seh]
[oh] okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him [oh] you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya [lah] cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that #upskirtism#
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
so he actually did it
look [eh] look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates [ah] bro
check it out I I was wrong okay [lah] I mean I think I can tell this to the camera [eh] to the camera <malay>pula</malay> to the recorder okay I was from #serangoon# right
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name [ah] but but but I don't know but
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like <malay>ini</malay> #aizat# #adam# <malay>ni semua</malay> like [eh] ya [eh] [eh] you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school <malay>dulu</malay>
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude [lah] but but <malay>macam</malay>
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many (uh) malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you won't find a malay chap in the in that class [ah]
so basically he was in one of those classes [ah]
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him [lah] like I I remember of
his existence back this in [ah]
yes
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times <malay>nanti aku</malay> google <malay>aku</malay> check [kan] <malay>lepas tu aku aku aku</malay> forward <malay>dekat kau</malay> [lah]
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that (uh) inhibits our society [ah] but basically ya [lah] back to what we were saying <malay>macam aku rasa</malay> that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference <malay>apa betul tak</malay> like
ya <malay>macam</malay> one thing about us <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) compared to <malay>kita punya</malay> parents [eh] <malay>macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita</malay> tend to <malay>macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita</malay> you know like our parents <malay>aku rasa dorangnya</malay> generations is like <malay>kau kenal ni satu perempuan</malay>
within a few months <malay>tunang</malay> another few months <malay>kahwin</malay> you know that sort of thing
ya
what was that so so so you see [eh] <malay>macam</malay> what #ondre# said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different [ah] you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like [oh] it was a norm [ah] like [oh] your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay <malay>kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit</malay> or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants [ah] you know so <malay>macam</malay> like
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally [lah] cause he's from that country
<malay>orang</malay> pakistan <malay>kat sini</malay> will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now [ah] so maybe <malay>kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa</malay> then talk talk talk [eh] I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to [ah] but of course I mean
maybe I don't know [ah] maybe we're we're looking at it differently [lah] maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation [ah] from what I understand [lah]
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum [ah]
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that <malay>macam</malay> (err) #syed ahmad# was interested in your mother
sorry #syed ahmad# we didn't mean to mention your name
[oh] okay
[oh] okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
[ah] we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
(um) okay so what was that okay so basically <malay>macam</malay> ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing [ah] so <malay>macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>anak aku</malay>
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
okay
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
okay
ya
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya
I think girls these days they are like <malay>lagi beza dari kita macam</malay> in the sense that they are really pressured to
look and ya look and behave a certain way [ah] perhaps [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
well I mean what can you say [ah] these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on [ah]
and I guess people are just
following trends [ah] just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
susceptible to this [ah] <malay>macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa</malay> in a way [lah] but <malay>aku rasa untuk wanita ni</malay>
<malay>dorang lebih senang dipengaruh</malay> [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> [ah] [ah] like compared to guys [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife <malay>macam</malay>
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
[ah] <malay>kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah</malay> you know that sort of thinking you know
but now is like quite common [ah] you know nowadays you have mosque
where they provide a place for you to do the <malay>walimah</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] but you still had your your function in a activity hall [ah] my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
a still somewhat rare for the whole <malay>majlis</malay> from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like <malay>masjid mawaddah</malay>
(err) I mean there there are some !huh!
no but bartley is like <malay>macam</malay> bartley is is is so called not really
(err) subject to any of these trends I feel [lah]
you can [lah] you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
I'm trying to say is that <malay>macam</malay> nowadays you have instances where people do say like [eh] should we have our <malay>majlis</malay> in a mosque cause then like <malay>orang nak sembahyang</malay> and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding [what] you know in a way [lah] but of course
<malay>pada aku pun aku rasa macam</malay> if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a <malay>walimah</malay> a small <malay>walimah</malay> outside the mosque [ah]
ya
okay [ah] not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so <malay>macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam</malay> that was
something that that was on her mind like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] why are we doing it in the mosque <malay>abeh macam</malay> like [oh] I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
[eh] why you buying a three room flat [sia] it's so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure [ah] I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning [ah]
[ah]
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day you just have to be
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that [ah] you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house [lah] I don't know whether I told you
ya !huh! ya ya <malay>aku dah</malay> end of this month [eh] end of this month [eh] end of this year <malay>dah enam tahun</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak</malay> upgrade to <malay>macam</malay> five room <malay>ke</malay> [ah]
#sengkang# <malay>juga</malay>
bro bro #tampines# <malay>mahal</malay> bro #tampines# <malay>mahal gila</malay> no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> #abbas# <malay>nya</malay> parents <malay>aku</malay> #sengkang# <malay>apa</malay>
bro #sengkang# bro #raeesah khan#
[oh] sorry was that too loud jamus #lim#
(err) unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not #sengkang# but it's okay
no no this is #ang mo kio# so
basically basically okay basically basically #sengkang# right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale [lah] so for those people who don't know #sengkang# you know is divided into this so called <malay>macam</malay> four districts <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] so (err) anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this <malay>sungai</malay> [lah]
it's called the <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# I think [ah] so like if you look out my window here you can see the <malay>sungai</malay> [ah]
so that <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# (err) is the boundary between #sengkang# which is held by the workers' party and #ang mo kio# which is held by pinky work
[ah] sorry [ah] every conversation between #zulika# and myself must involve some degree of politics [lah] then you know there's some spice [ah]
so (uh) we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come (uh) we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good [ah] [ah]
I I don't want to play games [ah] I mean I think I would draw the line at games [ah]
ya
my wife my wife and I [oh] but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife [ah] okay
[a'ah]
okay
!wah!
that's a very productive (err) your time bro
[oh] okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad [eh] you you should talk
you should talk to my cousin #abbas# [ah] who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me [eh] <malay>kalau kau suka</malay> breaking bad <malay>kau kena</malay> watch this better call saul [lah]
so <malay>aku macam aku ada tengok</malay> [ah] like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while <malay>aku macam</malay> how many seasons are there [oh] my god breaking bad only has five seasons
[oh] my god okay
ya [lah] he hasn't changed his name yet [lah]
okay
yes yes yes yes
(uh)
okay
[ah]
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see [oh] ya ya ya ya ya
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where <malay>abang dia yang</malay> very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
(err) so I think his brother died or something [eh]
okay I I think roughly around at that point <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them [ah] okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
[kan] there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle <malay>dia macam terus</malay> didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya [lah] but he kept on <malay>macam</malay> like downplaying <malay>si</malay> jimmy <malay>nya</malay> achievement [ah] <malay>dia macam cakap</malay> you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing [kan]
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago [sia]
okay
!huh!
I I've never watch game of thrones [ah] by the way
and the witcher <malay>ke apa</malay> witcher witcher <malay>pun aku tak tengok sangat</malay>
of course [ah] bro ya
there was a prison break movie
[eh] prison break <malay>si dia tu dah mati</malay> [kan] the actual <malay>dah mati</malay> [kan] the guy who plays michael scofield [lah]
yes he died right
okay let me google this michael scofield <malay>mati</malay>
wentworth miller
[oh] okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me [ah] no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true [ah]
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it [oh] ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
so is season five good or not <malay>dorang ada tulis</malay> prison break season six <malay>lagi tak</malay> [ah]
[oh] my god I I thought this was over [sia] bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
the movie was not on the <malay>ni ni</malay> [kan] the movie was on <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] only the final break
shucks [ah] #ikram# stop getting me hooked back on all this crap [lah] <malay>malas</malay> [sial] <malay>nak pergi tengok ni semua</malay>
[ah]
[oh] my god stop [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[a'ah]
[sial] [lah] bro you could have read all the books [seh] in all that time [sia] bro
[oh] I heard of that but I didn't watch it
<malay>aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh</malay> once I see <malay>macam satu benda ni ada</malay> four five seasons [kan]
<malay>aku terus lemah</malay> [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> no [lah] I cannot watch this [sia]
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that (err) I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently [lah] so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys [lah] so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay [ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
!hey! siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass <malay>punya</malay> app
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
[ah] all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful [lah] I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
mine is after iPhone eight [lah] basically <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] so so so it's one of those things that I don't know [ah] Apple fan boys are talking about these days [ah]
double double tap then the code <malay>keluar</malay>
the scanner the scanner the scanner <malay>keluar</malay> not the code the camera thingy ya
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
[a'ah]
(uh huh)
it automatically scans the code [oh] okay
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code [ah] <malay>macam ni kau tengok</malay> <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
no no no that's that's if you can [lah] <malay>kat bawah tu</malay> [kan]
then it goes <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
there <malay>kat bawah kat bawah sini</malay>
it goes in a anti clockwise [eh] clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this <malay>dia macam</malay> go
like that
so (uh) #inshallah# with [ah] I also reciting <malay>ayatul kursi</malay> we will get our twenty dollars and (err) we can spend it on a steak later at #jalan kayu#
[eh] so so so (err) we're coming to the end
shall we talk about our favourite <malay>makan</malay> places since it's almost lunch
<malay>tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I've never heard of it being described as a good place [lah]
okay
babe <malay>aku pun aku pun</malay> I know I know (err) anchorvale
<malay>dorang ada</malay> the vending machine cafe [ah] if that's what you are referring to
[oh] I think I know what your day is referring to
the <malay>yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung</malay>
yes so <malay>yassin kampung</malay> they have this off shoot called <malay>lepak</malay> one corner
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot <malay>lepak</malay> one corner it it doesn't feel like the <malay>lepak</malay> place [ah] it feels like you just go in <malay>kau beli makan dekat</malay> no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
[ah] both [ah]
okay ya good joke but [ah] so then <malay>macam apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia macam tempat makan dia</malay> [eh] <malay>dia macam</malay> okay <malay>kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam</malay> queue up <malay>dekat</malay> the stall [ah] so it's like a hawker stall [ah] it's like a hawker centre
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like <malay>abeh kau kena pergi sana</malay> order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that <malay>makanan dia</malay> okay [lah] not bad [lah] but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> so so <malay>juga</malay> but it doesn't have the <malay>lepak</malay> feeling [lah]
because like <malay>pada aku lepak</malay> feeling <malay>macam kau kau duduk</malay> then like [eh] #bhai# <malay>teh tarik lagi satu</malay> [ah] [eh] if you want to go place you should go to #mahamoodiya#
but I mean it's a bit late for for #prata# #simpang bedok# [ah]
you don't know #mahamoodiya#
yes the one next to the Shell [eh] <malay>dorang dah</malay> up market [sia]

I was looking through our the booking right
then <malay>aku</malay> realise
<malay>mahal</malay> [sia] it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the <malay>apa</malay> last week of the year [what]
[kan] then <malay>aku tak tahu macam mana</malay> like we need to have more options I guess
ya okay
but unless we go for the <malay>apa</malay> [ah] smaller rooms [ah]
because the one that I found was
that one <malay>untuk yang</malay> the suite room so <malay>aku rasa macam besar sangat</malay> I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
the same place because
okay (err)
<malay>aku rasa boleh</malay> [ah] but I think it's about <malay>dalam empat ratus gitu</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah]
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus [ah] below two hundred should be okay right
ya I think <malay>aku rasa</malay> for now <malay>empat orang</malay> but
ya I think only four [lah] right
unless dylan joining I'm not sure
ya so (err)
but I'm checking my friend like cause my friend got the (uh) call (um) membership
so he got discount [lah]
ya
that one is sofitel is at #tanjong pagar#
very near [what] the hotel I mean I mean you can go I mean it's around there's a lot of cafes there also [what]
ya
ya I think it's all nearby there [lah]
ya technically I don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon [lor]
yup
the price confirm <malay>makin mahal</malay>
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year I guess
ya [lor]
ya [oh] ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so I might have to take leave ya
but then I think I'll take the whole week [lah] I see how [lor] technically I got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya [oh] ya last year we had the what
botanic gardens theme [ah] the boy <malay>bunga</malay> theme
ya no but whenever #tanjong pagar# theme
don't know
I don't know [lah] maybe theme
[oh] ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
[oh] ya <malay>dia belum</malay> decide right
ya
[oh] really [ah]
from which (err) supermarket
prime is hard to find you know there's only like <malay>berapa</malay> [jer] <malay>dalam</malay> singapore <malay>ni</malay> [tau] <malay>nak cari</malay>
ya
#sheng siong# #sheng siong# also hard [sia]
I mean you see my area around down here there's no #sheng siong# the nearest is #bukit panjang# mall
giant [lah] since we just with brandon
[eh] last year we did giant
!aiya!
[eh] ya ya
so what
ya I remember the cause I think got more things to buy
<malay>kipas</malay> [oh] it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know <malay>sebelah-sebelah</malay> [leh] like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya <malay>bodoh</malay> so big [sia]
ya so what is just the four of us [ah] #xing jing# [oh] no with the others right because we doing dinner <malay>dengan yang lain-lain</malay> [kan] <malay>malam</malay> so
(mm)
who's the free one [ah]
can you plan
please
<malay>kau</malay> plan [lah] then <malay>kau bilang kita</malay> then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
you have to be codes
ya they <malay>bodoh</malay>
this is not chinese new year
this is christmas so <malay>tak payah</malay> #lohei#
dinner
I think dinenr can go all out [lah] I guess not all out as in <malay>macam terus</malay>
<malay>apa sakan</malay> [ah] but more like a
but now buffet very irritating [ah]
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve [lah] I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the <malay>makanan</malay> will <malay>dia ada</malay> server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
(mm)
he <malay>kena</malay> bullied
what what do you mean location <malay>kena</malay> change you mean the buffet town run away or what
is it I there's only one buffet town I think it's at raffles city
I know
[oh] ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
[oh] ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
for the dinner <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> [eh]
okay
(um) terrence I haven't check with him yet <malay>tapi aku rasa</malay> maybe <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> because that week he's going back to school already
[oh] ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least <malay>macam tujuh puluh</malay> percent <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> go to phase three [lah] so
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that [lah] they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members [lah] <malay>yang tinggal dalam serumah</malay> right
ya
different timing
ya
can
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas <malay>punya</malay> dinner [kan]
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely [lah] I mean you cannot meet [lah] but
so <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> like
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
[oh] ya just five of us [lah]
without partners [lor]
(mm)
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us [what]
korean ya that [ah]
#farin# birthday
[oh]
[oh] yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners [lor] that
#bo# #pian# [lah] [kan] <malay>macam tak boleh apa</malay>
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
I mean technically it's not even a <malay>macam</malay> public holiday on that day right
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya okay
I think he never go there before so you should be safe <malay>dia tak ada</malay> benchmark <malay>untuk tempat tu</malay>
ya
(um)
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work [lah]
then the next morning he will <malay>aku rasa</malay> go to the work straight
ya
(mm)
ya [lor]
so the tuesday morning <malay>aku rasa</malay> he has to go back to work [lor]
monday right
is it really
ya
[oh]
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
!hais!
okay [lor] we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday <malay>punya</malay> time slot I mean (err) rates ya
then he say it's like seven hundred [oh] my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred [sia]
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> taiwan
you are in a cold room
!whoa! but luckily I went taiwan [sia] just before lockdown
ya
(err) not as good as that one we we went that time
ya it was that one I go on march it was <malay>macam sejuk</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> just like aircon kind yes
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
!hais!
!hais! ya
ya
[eh] but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
(um) ya
but you know the that time the who say [ah] which minister
the he say <malay>macam apa</malay> like
he's not going they are not going to <malay>macam</malay> vaccinate everybody <malay>kat</malay> singapore
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> save <malay>duit agaknya</malay>
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably [lah] elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations [lah] wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel [lah]
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
was there [lah] [oh] my god
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> purpose [kan] I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so <malay>kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat</malay> they can just spread to each other [lah]
(err) they have another issue to tackle there [oh] my god
(mm)
are you talking about succulent
[oh] cactus cactus <malay>yang kecil-kecil gitu</malay> [eh] then
[oh]
<malay>dua</malay> cactus
the normal one cactus
no the normal cactus <malay>yang besar dia ada</malay> thorns then <malay>macam bulat-bulat gitu</malay> and <malay>dia punya</malay> shape
straight then <malay>bulat-bulat</malay> [eh] right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
<malay>kau siak</malay> [ah] !hey! <malay>mahal pokok tu</malay>
(mm)
[oh] I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what [sia] cardboard
[oh] what
<malay>kau tanam pokok</malay> durian [jer] [lah]
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
!hais! anyway I have an assignment on an essay [lah] so I need just (err) your your point of view [lah] I guess
(mm) it's about (um)
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
the experts say [lah] the lockdown causes more <malay>macam apa</malay> problems than benefits ya
why
(mm)
ya
true [leh] ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
(mm)
ya
(mm)
good [what] lockdown good [what] I was enjoying the period
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems [lah] rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
[oh]
ya
(mm)
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel [lah] like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation [lah] so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway (err)
<malay>macam dulu dia tak pakai</malay> grab but <malay>sekali</malay> now [oh] I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it [lah] rather than <malay>kau tahu macam kalau tak ada</malay> COVID like everybody is still
<malay>macam</malay> oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay [lah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya [lah] #alhamdulillah# I need the money so what's the problem
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money <malay>untuk</malay>
to avoid this (err) to convert their platform store into online platform [lah] so
<malay>aku rasa</malay> okay [lah]
(mm)
true I mean you will lose your human touches also [lah] right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa</malay> what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>semua buat</malay> #dalgona# coffee <malay>macam kau</malay>
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
(err)
I think it brings families together
kind
<malay>macam</malay>
you will just stuck at home with your family [lah] you got no choice but just to interact <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> like
that's all [lah] like
so
ya
I know
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like <malay>kalau kau baca</malay> that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
not every family can get along [lah] hundred percent get along so
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one !wah! then
ya
right ya
(mm)
ya obviously
ya
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better [lah] because you know carbon footprints were reduced [lah] I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit [lah] of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight [lah] like just
ya
ya
ya
okay [lah] at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress [lah] I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit [leh]
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
(mm)
ya
then <malay>aku rasa</malay> like I think they <malay>dia orang tak</malay> concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
maybe they did [lah] like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
I mean during the even like <malay>dia punya apa</malay>
not counsellors [lah] what what is it calling
<malay>orang yang</malay>
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
so they don't really care about that part <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but
ya
(mm)
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes [lah] but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya [eh] can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society [lah] I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case [lah] on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water [one]
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito [one]
it's true okay [lah] but that's not really a problem I guess
it just go without the track [what] [sia] <malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down [lah]
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel [lah] at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] confirm <malay>ada</malay> [lah]
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot [leh]
is it
aren't we not at the top
[oh] we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest [lah]
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then <malay>macam</malay> suddenly <malay>kau dalam hutan tu kau</malay> introduce <malay>monyet kau</malay> introduce pangolin <malay>kau</malay> introduce lemur <malay>pelanduk</malay> I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
<malay>pergi mana balik rumah kau</malay>
ya <malay>ni bukan</malay> library [tau] <malay>kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil</malay> [tau]
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to [lah] but it's not possible [lah] per se
[oh] my god
[oh] that one that they kill all the animal [ah] but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus [what] ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
so they have to kill or <malay>macam</malay> that one [lah] like what chicken flu like that [eh] bird flu chicken flu
they have to kill all the the chickens [mah]
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
<malay>sekali</malay> coronavirus from plants [leh]
yes
<malay>apa apa merepek kau</malay>
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya inside the middle [ah]
(uh huh)
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese (err) [ah] swiss cheese plant
stop it [lah]
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times [leh]
what is a prayer plant
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but monstera is an indoor plant [what] right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
(mm)
ya
ya
technically they are bushes [lah] weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
not really [leh]
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt [leh]
<malay>kau masih</malay> [tau]
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer [lah] but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
(err) the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk [leh] like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also [what] light can [ah]
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
<malay>dah mati ke</malay>
can [ah]
ya probably can [lah] I don't know
I don't know it just grows short [lah] from small to big [lah] I guess shoots ya
!hais!
I only need to buy one plant <malay>untuk taruh dalam</malay> office <malay>aku</malay>
no [oh] my god that one
<malay>mati kesian benda tu</malay>
but actually <malay>mati</malay> a very terrible death to do
ya [sia] <malay>kau teruk</malay> [sia]
then we got scraping <malay>benda tu</malay>
no [meh]
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
[ah]
(mm)
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office (uh) condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
!aiya! the typical <malay>kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> coconut tree but it's not
what is it called [eh] <malay>yang</malay>
it's not coconut tree <malay>yang pokok-pokok yang</malay>
fern <malay>gitu</malay> is it look like a fern
!aiya! very the
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] serious
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
ya usually events that kind of <malay>pokok</malay> [lah] you know like those
standard <malay>pokok</malay> I don't know
it's the typical <malay>pokok</malay> at events you know
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
(mm) [oh] my god
(mm)
yes that's one thing <malay>pokok pisang</malay>
!hais!
(mm)
spray is it then
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
(mm)
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also [what] if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
(mm)
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
(mm) ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die [sia]
(hmm)
[oh] my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough [lah] too much plants [ah] mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant [eh]
[oh] no
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
it's like a fern anyway
!hais!
you don't have class so what you gonna do tomorrow

[eh] no he he haven't even throw his his rod ya then was three already
then I ask him [eh] you don't want to open your rod <malay>campak umpan</malay> then he was like <malay>nanti</malay> [ah] <malay>tengok</malay> then I was like okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] I go I go change my <malay>umpan</malay>
because at the right side only got because it was this [one] is an open area it's an open area
then there was two ways to go to the sea so the three of them go this way me and I forgot who [ah] I think
#han# [ah] we go to the right so (um)
the the rest of them was doing their <malay>umpan</malay> on the left side so I went to their right side
then <malay>ambil</malay> [ah] <malay>udang hidup pegang</malay> [lah] <malay>benda tu goyang-goyang</malay> then <malay>tengah tengah dah dah dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> poke [ah] <malay>dah</malay> poke the <malay>udang</malay>
then <malay>dah campak dah campak dah</malay> #rilek# [ah] then I was like ya <malay>tengok</malay> it was it's a nice scenery [lah] then then I realised I I heard something on the right side then I was like <malay>itu apa tu</malay> then I I listen closely [lah]
then it was actually <malay>azan</malay> [ah] [ah] three
three <malay>azan</malay> I don't know <malay>azan buat</malay> [lah] <malay>terkejut</malay> I also don't know [lah]
ya three [ah] <malay>azan</malay> then I was like <malay>azan</malay> [eh] then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real [ah] if there is a <malay>kampung</malay> beside [lah]
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask #nos# [eh] #nos# beside <malay>yang tempat</malay> we <malay>pancing</malay> got <malay>kampung</malay> [ah] then <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] then I was like
[oh] <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan</malay>
I heard <malay>ada macam ada orang tengah azan</malay> and I I stood there for quite some time [lah] just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly [lah] [eh] <malay>kau tak bilang</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>kau tak kejut aku</malay> then I was like <malay>apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ</malay>
ya then that that was the first story then the second time I wasn't there [ah] this [one] was #han# #han# and the rest went I I didn't went there
so he was like (um) <malay>tertidur</malay>
then he tried to sleep you know [ah] he always try to sleep when he <malay>pancing</malay> [one] then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then <malay>dia pusing pusing pusing</malay> then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree [lah] <malay>kat tengah-tengah</malay> in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree [lah] then he saw one <malay>nenek</malay> one <malay>nenek</malay>
walk pass then he was like [ah] the <malay>nenek</malay> told him like #cu# #cu# <malay>dah tahu sini tempat keras</malay> [kan] <malay>asal malap</malay> [jer] <malay>di tempat</malay> you [eh] <malay>macam tempat</malay> you <malay>pula</malay> [eh] no no no not that
why why (um) <malay>malap</malay> [jer] <malay>tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap</malay> like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight [lah] but that day he just never on it [lah] then
#han# already know [lah] he he got experience before then after that he knows that this [one] is
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> this [one] is mystics [lah] like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
(um) like [oh] (err) then he just keep quiet [lah]
keep quiet then #rilek-rilek# then the <malay>nenek</malay> (um) turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that [lah]
then he he knows already [lah] then he just stay awake [lah] then the next day the driver came [ah] came to pick them up
then the driver say got one time he was passing by [ah] at night [ah] then he actually saw at the <malay>pokok</malay> there <malay>ada</malay> (err) <malay>pocong</malay> [ah] <malay>tengah</malay>
so it it means that like that <malay>nenek</malay> come to actually warn them that that place very <malay>malap</malay> then got other stuff also [lah] then that that <malay>nenek</malay> just go there to warn them [lah] like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice [lah] but it's just <malay>malam</malay> ya <malay>malam kena jaga-jaga</malay> ya
that that particular
(mm)
(mm)
but it's not from malaysia [lah] [oh] so they they hear all over
so loud
(mm)
maybe that that might explain but three in the morning testing mic [ah]
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this [one] is where the driver will drive [eh] drive then this is an open area <malay>di sini ada satu pokok</malay> in the middle
then when you look out into the sea right you can see there's two paths that goes to the sea then if you go to the left
path [ah] actually the right path also can you will see <malay>pulut ketam</malay> in front of you that stretch like that [ah] towards the tip [lah] you can see the whole tip of #pulau ketam#
[ah] I think it's like fifteen minutes drive it's ten to fifteen minutes
ya ya ya if I'm not wrong because in the when we fish
in the morning when we wake up or is it we [ah] ya in the morning we fishing fishing fishing then the people all
sailing in front then we like no no don't don't then we see our rod move !alamak!
then you are literally pulling the kayak
ya balance things out [lah] !huh!
[lah] [kan] [eh]
then your past few days <malay>macam mana</malay> your past few months [ah] [ah] the time the last
time I met you then you say you just <malay>berhenti kerja</malay> [pe] you just stop work
(mm)
(mm)
but how many how many jobs have you applied for
so <malay>apa</malay> you you apply mostly what type of <malay>apa</malay> industry
what phone call [eh] <malay>kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau</malay> english all the way [eh] have you never notice beginning
then all the all the sentence all english
that's why
then (err)
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the <malay>cerita</malay> so <malay>kau dah</malay> apply <malay>kerja habis semua tak dapat</malay> [ah] all all rejected you
ya [lah]
ambassador
okay is that's that's north right
central (err) [ah] ya
(mm)
within the week
within the month
ya
ya [lah]
<malay>sakit hati</malay> [ah]
surrounding surrounding
surrounding have a few other <malay>masjid</malay> in the east
[ah] okay I think I I understood
okay okay
because of that
[ah]
so what you did you tell anyone no [ah]
but but whose that middle person
(mm)
then different different person
(mm)
#fandi ahmad#
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's why [lah] is
no [lah] I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background <malay>juga</malay> [kan]
you will need to come in and explain to them [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] this the way the reason why I <malay>letak</malay> the moderator first then followed by the asatizah</malay> then followed by (err) #fandi ahmad# is because
(um) according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever (uh) I know that first <malay>kau kena letak</malay> the moderator first
why why why the moderator first <malay>pasal dia yang akan</malay> moderate everything then followed by the <malay>asatizah</malay> who are
who will be the one main speakers [ah] who would be the main speakers in the
in the forum itself then #fandi ahmad# at the back because he's just a guest maybe you you can explain it like that [lah]
[ah]
game [lah]
(mm)
a caricature [lah]
no [lah] to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of <malay>macam situasi</malay> [lah]
(mm)
but this is but this [one] is what is considered as a volunteering or are they paying you
say you wanted to help [ah]
ya
ya that's why [lah] that's not like you said [lah] is <malay>tak</malay> professional [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm) ya is a
of course is the comic [lah] because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group <malay>akan dibawa naikkan</malay> to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that <malay>dalam kamu punya</malay> age group [lah] so it's better for you in that sense [ah]
[ah]
yes
ya
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera <malay>dah berapa mahal</malay> then (err) the time you took to edit I actually
<malay>pernah</malay> I <malay>pernah</malay> help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge [ah] <malay>tentang</malay> video [ah] the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship [lah] then after that then <malay>apa tu</malay> the thing is
<malay>kenapa tak ada</malay> any background in Photoshop <malay>ke apa ke</malay> so <malay>nak</malay> edit <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> edit so I ask you for help that time
then after that then the way I see you edit [ah] !aduh! is just to edit like a one minute sequence like
that [one] was one minute that video was one minute itself and it took us what three days just to edit one minute
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was <malay>tak susah</malay> because <malay>tak banyak</malay> animation <malay>tak banyak</malay> at that time [lah] it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence <malay>itu pun dah boleh jadi gila</malay>
then ya I understand because as a programmer <malay>nanti</malay> I do some programs <malay>ke apa</malay> and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later <malay>dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti</malay> [eh] #hakim# (um) actually the client <malay>tak suka</malay> (uh) this part of the game [ah] can change it then <malay>dalam hati aku macam</malay> what it took me hours to get that part working
the way you wanted it now you say the client don't want it
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research <malay>tengok</malay> whether <malay>apa tu apa yang</malay> client <malay>tu nak</malay> is feasible <malay>tak</malay> can it be included
into the program itself <malay>macam</malay> the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so [oh] <malay>sakit</malay>
definitely [lah]
[eh] feelings feelings
say goodbye
<malay>dengar cerita</malay>
true story actually <malay>sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap</malay>
#sulaiman#
no [lah] is is just <malay>pelik</malay> [lah]
tolong</malay>
<malay>malam jumaat</malay>
so
I must I must say that it's not we start the day is we start the night but our night is not the day the day
[oh]
<malay>dah</malay> start <malay>merepek</malay>
(err) podcast
you know the back to the story <malay>sikit</malay> right just now I talk about my intern so my intern [kan] I was being paid (err) one thousand dollars
per month ya
[eh] #rilek# [ah] #rilek# [ah] <malay>dengar dulu</malay> but but the thing is the time (err) I'm from
so <malay>bila kita</malay> (um) want to sign up for <malay>apa tu</malay> for internship you need to go through this website [ah] I forgot what's the website [oh] my <malay>apa</malay> website <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] website <malay>tu ada ada</malay> [lah] <malay>masih situ</malay> [ah]
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to <malay>gaji</malay> so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over [ah] fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through <malay>gaji</malay> like which one is higher pay [lah]
so we can only select up to three so that time I picked three jobs one is
paying me one point eight one is paying me one point five and the last one was only paying me one point two so
I applied I forgot this job pays me which one because by the time I accept it I went to check back they take down the info like how much they pay whatsoever it's just the address [lah] the address of the company then after that then I was like okay [lah] at least I know I'm getting paid
at least one point two [lah]
then I went in then I went in #rilek-rilek# talk with my colleagues then got other interns <malay>juga situ</malay> they are leaving already
then I was like [eh] your <malay>gaji berapa</malay> [ah] how much <malay>kau dapat</malay> every month one thousand !huh! [eh] one thousand <malay>sikitnya</malay>
!wah! <malay>sikitnya</malay> one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like [oh] according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know [lah] but
the same exact thing that I'm telling you I I told them so it's like I think at least one point two [lah] [eh] cannot be [what] no there's no there was it's just allowance
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like <malay>apa hal ni</malay>
then after that then then the thing is I went to the boss I went to the boss then after lunch I went to the boss
the thing is my company is just a small company is a so there's only like ten to twelve of us working
so I went up to the boss after lunch and [eh] boss (uh) can ask you something [ah] yes yes what you want to ask I just want to ask [ah] the the allowance
is one thousand [ah] because I went to check the internet they say like if I'm not wrong is like one point two or one point five ya we only pay one thousand [ah]
I think this type of thing you need to check with the school then I'm like
<malay>malas</malay> you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay [ah] once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay [lah] <malay>rezeki di mana-mana</malay>
no you will say can <malay>boleh macam mana</malay> [oh] you need to sign up this you need to do that [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay>
I give it to you
typical malay [ah]
!aduh!
<malay>kau nak doa lapan minit kau pergi doa</malay>
actually I so
just asking [ah] I I I haven't actually really go and see so they are linguists
plus computer science ya
we just keep it simple [lah] keep it simple
#mat-mat# #mat-mat# [ah]
nothing [lah] it's nothing nothing much
[ah] so little bit [lah] just just to cover up that that last seven minutes now I guess six minute yes
so go apply school [lah] [ah] [oh] ya talking about
Grab [lah] last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see <malay>macam dia punya</malay> timeline [ah] like what do you
said so we are going back one hour ago
so
<malay>kau cakap kau nak kerja</malay> Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo [oh] <malay>betul</malay> [eh] <malay>jauh</malay>
because I I myself also got (um) work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is [ah] the pay to me is I tell you [lah] it's quite it's quite [ah] quite decent for I would say (err) part time [lah] because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get [lah] so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
if you if you hustle even more <malay>macam</malay> hustle <malay>demi</malay> hustle [jer] is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that [one] is motor [lah] but ya [lah] but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you really can't get anything because <malay>apa tu</malay> okay [lah] I got learn some finance also [lah] [kan] you should know [lah] so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in [lah] rather than just <malay>duit terkeluar duit terkeluar</malay> then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the <malay>rezeki belum masuk lagi</malay> in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders [ah] per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
take off like okay [ah] <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat</malay> [ah] I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
a good place for you to like start [lah] then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
from your house <malay>sini jalan kaki</malay> #punggol# #sengkang# further [eh] macritchie further
<malay>mana</malay> [seh]

I mean it will get better [lah] I mean <malay>yang</malay> COVID <malay>ni semua bukan</malay> like forever [what] they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tengok</malay> [ah]
(mm) that's true
I don't know
I mean
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on <malay>cari kerja ke</malay> start business <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>kau nak buat</malay> business <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
(mm)
but <malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam sikit</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kau masih beli benda kat</malay> habbo
(mm) <malay>masih</malay> spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
[oh] how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like <malay>jual</malay> your <malay>benda</malay> and quit or
(mm)
<malay>banyak sangat benda</malay> [kan]
(mm)
not like what if it gets worst <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> remove <malay>banyak benda</malay> from the game then <malay>orang semua macam tak nak main</malay>
then what happens
true
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but like
sad [sia] they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market (uh) like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game [eh] without the players what do you have like an empty online page
(mm)
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
I think <malay>dia orang macam tak fikir</malay> they gonna cause
<malay>macam</malay> like to them at the end of the day <malay>kita</malay> like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
and that's what has been happening [what] like the
<malay>macam</malay> like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then <malay>orang masih beli</malay> [pe] it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
[kan]
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
<malay>habis</malay> smite <malay>apa jadi</malay>
ya
[oh] really cause I know that day (uh) <malay>siapa naim</malay> asked (uh) #ilyas# to join but then #ilyas# said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that [lah]
(mm) four days ago three days ago ya <malay>macam</malay>
the file got too big for #ilyas# so like <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> download then <malay>sampai dia</malay> have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why [ah] <malay>ilyas dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like [oh] I cannot play with you cause <malay>sekarang dia main</malay> among us [jer]
ya
I think <malay>baru</malay> [ah] like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but <malay>dia cakap dia</malay> delete <malay>semua benda tinggal yang</malay> programme files
like <malay>dia</malay> basically formatted his ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
<malay>dia cakap dulu</malay> file <malay>dia macam</malay> fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen <malay>lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu</malay>
it's probably him ya
I don't know [sia]
cause that time <malay>dia cakap dia punya</malay> app <malay>ada</malay> issue [lah] he couldn't log in so <malay>dia</malay> delete then <malay>bila dia nak</malay> redownload <malay>balik tak boleh</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> format like remove everything from <malay>dia punya</malay> <malay>lepas tu semua benda</malay> like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
ya and he spent so much on that game also [what] I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
[oh] ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want [sia]
I don't know
that'll be cool though can you imagine <malay>yang</malay> character character <malay>dia semua jadi</malay> spongebob <malay>punya</malay> character <malay>macam</malay> mister crab sandy
cute [sia]
(oo) is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
#kumbhakarna#
yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(oo)
and another person [orh]
(hmm) that's hard good looks or fit body
probably go with good looks but I mean <malay>pasal kalau</malay>
<malay>badan sapau pun</malay> I mean you can just go to the gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that <malay>tapi kalau nak muka baru</malay> I mean you can't really do that also [what] so probably good looks
(mm)
ya I guess <malay>banyak banyak duit</malay> at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like <malay>kalau nak</malay> like make yourself fitter and stuff <malay>boleh pergi lari</malay> and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
then yourself [leh]
(mm)
yes
ya
true
I mean to a certain extent <malay>semua orang pun macam</malay> at least a bit [ah]
true
(mm)
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> then there's really like no point
good looks
ya
(hmm)
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but <malay>kalau</malay>
no any other day (hmm)
<malay>kalau ni hari</malay> not much [lah] I'm just going to go home and like rest but like <malay>kalau esok</malay> maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
<malay>nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang</malay> haven't <malay>dah lama belum potong rambut</malay> so maybe I shall do that
and
ya
[oh] ya not not bald [lah] no [lah] like as in like short
I don't know I
<malay>rasa macam</malay> free [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
<malay>sekarang muka macam</malay> maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short <malay>macam</malay> medium length <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak panjang sangat pun</malay>
but ya
<malay>kalau kat rumah</malay> (hmm)
netflix <malay>lepas tu</malay>
[ah]
<malay>main</malay> and playing a bit of
(um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah]
(mm) ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
(uh) no I haven't played cause like I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>main dengan naim</malay> and #muhammad# they very competitive and then like if #ilyas# is not there like can't really
like tag along so like
so I usually <malay>kalau dia orang dua</malay> [jer] then I I avoid
but like <malay>kalau</malay> the rest <malay>main</malay> then <malay>aku main</malay> [ah] cause I
!huh! really I didn't know
[oh] you didn't say
did you say [oh] I didn't see
I didn't
[oh] no he means he can't even play at all ya
I mean the same thing happened <malay>bila</malay> that time I tried to download <malay>kat</malay> my macbook <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang</malay>
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my
cause I don't think they have a <malay>punya</malay> file
ya
(mm)
<malay>satu benda</malay>
just one (mm)
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
[oh] ya <malay>kalau satu benda dapat rumah</malay> [ah]
ya so you like
(mm)
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
[kan]
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
<malay>kau nak beli rumah punya susah</malay>
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
I mean <malay>kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah</malay> then at most <malay>kau kerja untuk</malay>
maybe your savings and then like <malay>sikit untuk makan minum</malay> bills
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
[oh]
I guess
I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to [ah] like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
#yishun#
we move to an island <malay>yang tak ada orang</malay>
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [ah]
ya let's go look for that cow later
<malay>hantu</malay>
so what the cow is the <malay>hantu</malay> or like
is there
interesting we go find out [lah]
[kan]
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
maybe <malay>orang</malay> maybe like someone like <malay>dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa</malay>
<malay>macam buang kat sana kesian</malay>
<malay>dia lari</malay>
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
[oh]
I mean the
the latest the one I think just got removed what the <malay>kampung</malay>
I mean there's still one that exists that like
I don't know #buangkok# some some no as in like an actual <malay>kampung macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu</malay> ya
<malay>yang</malay> that time I went there <malay>untuk yang satu</malay> filming for this
<malay>cerita hantu</malay> [ah]
ya went there and then <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> (uh) <malay>tempat tu memang ada benda</malay> [ah] like there's there's actual <malay>hantu</malay> living there ya
and then like there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> [ah] like this chinese auntie
she owns the place basically and then like (uh)
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
<malay>abeh dia orang cakap macam</malay> (um) like <malay>kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam</malay> have like
good intentions like you can't be there to <malay>macam</malay>
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened [lah] when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
(mm) ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like [oh] I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
she said like <malay>kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur</malay> [lah] just let it be
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
we film from I think like we arrived there at six [ah] so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the <malay>hantu</malay> was late
like really late and then [ah] they wanted to start filming at like eight
and then we had to delay and then wait then (um) when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her <malay>punya</malay> costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the <malay>hantu</malay> it was quite quite interesting to see her change [ah] cause
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] she's like I think some
model or something
so she's quite tall [lah] and then like (um)
her features were like pretty [lah] like
like a model person's features
<malay>abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu</malay> and then it's kind of fun [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) that part that was the one [lah]
ya
(mm) ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying [lah] cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal <malay>yang kecil punya</malay> contact lenses it's a full eye one
so like
we were kind of worried [lah] that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god [lah] like <malay>nasib</malay> [ah]
<malay>benda tu jadi</malay> so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary [ah] to see her in the dark
like wandering around and shit
ya [lah] but then it's the only <malay>kampung</malay> I know that exists in singapore [lah]
ya
that <malay>kampung</malay>
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they are very nice and then the when we were there <malay>kita nampak macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay> caucasian people #ang moh# like white people
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
they were like <malay>dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang nampak</malay> then <malay>kita punya</malay> filming <malay>punya benda</malay> then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] what you're doing
then we just like like we told them [lah] like [oh] we're filming a horror movie here
they like [oh] okay cool cool and <malay>jalan</malay>
but it's quite interesting place [ah] cause it's surrounded by
quite a few like (um) there's a lot of <malay>kampung</malay> houses [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> maybe <malay>ada lima ke enam orang</malay> [jer] <malay>tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang</malay> [ah]
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that <malay>kampung</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> she does the upkeeping and stuff [ah] and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
that hut that looks like a #kopitiam#
like <malay>ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam</malay> I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
but it's exist now ya
ya it's very close it's like <malay>macam kalau</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> like here and then it's just <malay>kat bawah</malay>
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the <malay>kampung</malay> area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
<malay>besar juga</malay> [ah] like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor [lah]
so like ya
it's all <malay>kayu</malay> and then like very old school [lah] <malay>semua macam</malay>
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
stay in the <malay>kampung</malay>
[oh] visit !huh! there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
ya it's quite <malay>gelap</malay> I mean there there is a few street lights [ah] like around the area but it's quite dark and then (um)
the there's a road that goes through the entire place [lah] so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tempat dia memang besar</malay> like really quite big ya
and but we only hear like
like explore like one small corner of it cause <malay>bila kita masuk kita naik</malay> lorry <malay>kena bawa semua</malay> equipment [kan] so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like #paiseh# [ah] cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
<malay>aku datang</malay> just <malay>tengok-tengok abeh</malay> like <malay>macam tolong sini tolong sana</malay>
and then (um)
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like [oh] !wah! so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya <malay>dah pukul lapan gitu</malay> then she came over
then she was like <malay>kau orang nampak apa-apa tak</malay> and I'm like (um) no and then she said like <malay>kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut</malay> nothing [one]
<malay>dia hantu baik</malay> then I'm like okay
ya
she just goes around does that every time
[ah] but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice [ah] it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
(um)
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting [ah] the place
interesting
(um)
I honestly don't know [ah] I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night [lah]
ya I think same [ah] if like I had to like
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will <malay>tunggu malam baru keluar</malay> cause <malay>panas sangat</malay> like everyday it's so humid and hot
true
but
[oh] ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
(mm)
(mmhmm)
really
that's interesting
(uh) the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes [sia] is it even open I think it is already [lah] if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
#pulau semakau# that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
<malay>tiga tahun</malay> [eh] it's quite recent [sia]
three years quite recent [lah] ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
[orh] [orh]
catty
catty enclosure
(mm)
and jumping on things
(mm)
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed [lah] like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible [lah] to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age [sia] the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from #yishun#
#yishun# has cold weather and move it
but like <malay>kesian juga</malay> [ah] like you when you <malay>tengok</malay> the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
I want go <malay>yang tempat apa tu yang dekat</malay> gardens by the bay [ah]
<malay>pergi satu kali</malay> [ah] when in maybe secondary school
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not [meh]
it was
it was [lah] cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
(uh) five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya [sia]
sec four [lah] so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
[orh]
it's quite pretty [lah] the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and #changi# airport
<malay>tiga</malay> wish
(hmm)
that's a hard question
<malay>aku nak rumah</malay>
but legit [lah] like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
(oo)
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
(hmm)
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job [oh] my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
<malay>entah abeh</malay>
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
(mmhmm)
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
(mm)
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
[oh] ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
(mm)
ya previous
(mm) money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so what the hell
!wow!
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
[oh]
(mm)
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
(oo) okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> free <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau bayar</malay> then okay [ah] <malay>aku bingit</malay> but then <malay>kalau</malay> free
then collect <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dekat rumah aku</malay> okay [lah] and
I mean ya <malay>memang</malay> [ah] like <malay>buang masa juga</malay> cause
they tell you like [oh] you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing <malay>abeh</malay> it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
(mm)
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it [ah] so like
probably not
(mmhmm)
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
(mm)
(mm)
no one was interested
ya
(mmhmm)
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay [lah] to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
(mmhmm)
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like !oops!
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
but I don't think <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
(mm)
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
[orh]
same
I just I cannot imagine like
<malay>tak suka</malay>
[oh]
I was like !huh!
ya
<malay>kat bawah</malay> block
!huh! <malay>sini takde banyak kucing</malay>
[oh] that's weird
the hell
only got <malay>lembu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
have you seen your cat <malay>luar</malay>
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
your cat is wild

that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
<malay>seram</malay> [sia]
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
[orh]
(mm)
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
(mm)
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(hmm) <malay>bila</malay> like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
<malay>abeh batuk rabak</malay> [sia] it's like cannot breathe and stuff
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
<malay>sekarang</malay> if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy [ah] like if he comes too close like my face
and then <malay>kalau</malay> when I <malay>mandi</malay> him like
that's when it gets bad [lah] like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it [lah] but like it's fine (uh) it's fine [lah] he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
[oh] really
[orh]
I mean get scared [lah] like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine [lah] like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
(mm)
(mmhmm)
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic [what] then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die [lah] confirm but like
[oh]
(mm)
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to <malay>macam</malay> pursue technology
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
(mm)
is put to use
ya
(mm)
somewhere else
that needs it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
the president speaks in malay <malay>kau orang semua</malay> stop it [eh]
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think <malay>kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi</malay> I just I just want to give you a warning [eh] <malay>kau</malay> stop [jer] [eh] <malay>jangan buat lagi</malay> [tau]
then okay <malay>kau balik</malay> like
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing

I had to focus [ah] <malay> macam
every weekend I book out right <malay> aku terus macam malas [ah] just
like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like (mm)
don't know what to do [ah]
okay then once my
that (uh) batch <malay> habis okay that batch finish
then I was like okay [lah] I need to do something [ah] the deadline coming close
okay I start I do I do all the needed documents
I print (err) not print I search for all the
(err) (err) what what all the
courses that I whatever paper whatever certifications that I got I
<malay> cari [ah]
I dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig
then (err) they want us to submit that online
okay so (err) at that point of time I applied for two course
which is one is the course that you're in what is it [ah] what is it called
okay okay so I applied for the is honours [kan]
okay okay
ya so I applied for that one and then <malay> macam
like okay [ah] maybe one application or
one choice a bit too little [lah] so I choose one more
ya but I only applied for one
like I think
they gave me four options or six option I cannot remember but
I don't know I and [ah] [eh] is it I don't know okay okay
so I was like okay (err) maybe I I put two [ah] so one was
infocomm security then the second [one] was
(err)
I think some design or

that (um) the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about (err) entertainment or something [ah]
they requested for a portfolio because <malay> macam they want to see what what I have done
back (uh) any <malay> macam past experience or whatever
so that I can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should [ah] so
ya that was when I realised [ah] so
what I did was I
like (uh) screw it [ah] I don't want to apply for this course then I delete it from my option
the moment I delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then I was like [oh] okay
ya I only applied for one option [lah] I only put one choice

<malay> dua ratus mampus
<malay> dua ratus lebih baik kau bagi aku [sia]
<malay> kau kau tahu [ah] <malay> aku <malay> sembilan [kan]

(err) <malay> tunjuk ada error
<malay> macam they cannot (err) get the
bill from their system
okay
so then (uh) the the person in charge they like [oh] (err)
can you come to the
computer here I I check the reason then I was okay they check they check they check then they the
that lady was like [oh] (err) are you still are you still in are you still serving
then I was like [oh] [ah] I just finished I just like
last week then she was like (uh) okay okay then I have to remove you from the eleven B scheme [oh] man
that was like ninety eight dollars
it was polyclinic [sia] <malay> kau kau bayangkan polyclinic <malay> bayar sembilan puluh lapan !huh!
!hais!
[eh] at least <malay> aku tak tipu apa kau cakap aku cakap aku #wei#
ya [lah]
ya [lah] of course [ah] I I expected I need to pay but I
was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
(mm) !huh!
!hais!
you know you know my my <malay> encik wanted me to extend six months [eh]
I was like
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that [one] is before (err) [ah] but six months is a very long
think so I don't know [lah]
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing [ah]
[a'ah]
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work [ah] honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
[eh] I would not think twice
(err) I I don't like my <malay> encik (uh)
I just
I just don't like my <malay> encik [ah] that's all
ya serious [ah]
one last talk
[oh] I see
[oh] [ho] <malay> dua jam
[oh] I see
<malay> kau punya
<malay> kau punya boss <malay> apa umur
okay [ah] <malay> muda [ah]
<malay> aku punya kau kau rasa aku punya berapa
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
<malay> apa otai [sia] <malay> orang tua
I see I see
no [lah] okay so (uh)
<malay> kira I don't like working with my <malay> encik [ah] it's just like <malay> macam
<malay> kau bayangkan
(err) <malay> kau kau ikut apa dia orang dia suruh kau buat tahu
okay then <malay> tiba tibs
<malay> dia tambah lagi dia tambah dia tambah dia tambah tambah tambah aku [dah] tak boleh tak boleh tahan [lah]
then <malay> macam
when we expect him to cover for us [eh] <malay> macam we do what he expect us to do
and then
there's a second layer so basically <malay> macam my <malay> encik is my first level
to [eh] no sorry my
is my first level to to complaint [lah] <malay> katakan
and then followed by my <malay> encik
and then basically then go up to [ah] so there's this
thing in [eh] there's one more layer in between my and my <malay> encik which is that directing staff
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
(err)
(err) expect a lot from the from us [ah]
basically so <malay> macam
standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
[a'ah] ya
and okay so you know how in
(err) they say [oh] okay (err) the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the [one] doing all this (err)
all these checks right correct
(uh huh) okay
so we also have the
<malay> macam what's
we also had the schedule [lah]
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
(err) the [one] that we don't like [lah]
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about (err) the duty (err) is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
for example I have five sergeants one person will do the check for that day or for that morning [ah] <malay> katakan
then
so this directing staff came down he was like [oh] (err) what time already I was like !huh!
what do you mean he's like (err) why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like !huh!
what you expect [sia] you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check [ah]
you get what I mean
ya [lah]
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check [ah] rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like [ha]
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
check <malay> gitu something like that [lah]
so we're like (err) when when I going it was like [ah] don't care already [ah] because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already [ah]
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies [ah]
(um)
okay okay
what you have done [lah] [ha]
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
[oh] don't have [eh]
okay then I guess (err)
(mmhmm)
okay [lah] but okay that
and he still cannot
(mmhmm)
last week
that one your problem [ah]
just say that [lah]
[oh]
(err) you feel bad for him [ah]
okay [lah] okay [lah]
your brother [ah] your brother [ah]
I guess ya
<malay> aku lain aku everyday [jer] stress [ah]
I have to
<malay> kau imagine okay <malay> kau imagine (err)
let's say okay you you're taking this batch for one month
like then (um)
within that four weeks there is a few weekend correct
are are you being disturbed on weekends or no
sometimes [ah]
then for me if I am every week every day
my phone will ring my phone will message got ping [one] confirm I tell you vibrate or whatever [lah]
everyday will do and everyday !hais! that's why I'm getting tired of it
example like (err) interacting with
well
I have to deal with forty two recruits
[oh] then (err) the the recruit asking me if I single also that one [ah]
is it
serious I got
like (uh) no [lah] no no no I got one I got one guy during my right
he he was in a relationship with one other guy pin pin in his
in his (uh) vocation training
okay so what happened was (uh) they broke up
they broke up and I was and I was the direct (err) seccom
so ya so like I have to <malay> macam
coax him [ah] like [oh] [eh] don't like (err)
(err) feel bad [lah] don't don't think like it's the end or something [lah] whatever
then finishing the course [ah] he come to me he say sergeant single or not what the heck

okay testing

so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of (um) hitting the red waves
yeah
[ah] but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements [ah]
take this as a the centre marking [ah]
so how was your prep
<malay>tadi lambat lagi</malay> [oh]
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like [ah] (um) what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that [lah] so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but what what was the instructor's comments
(mm)
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money [ah]
it's the same bike
(mm)
E brake [eh]
<malay>hujung sini punya</malay> side [ah]
[oh] okay okay ya [ha] ya it's there [ah] okay wait it was on the straight road
[oh] corner <malay>yang</malay> third corner
ya there's one mirror there
ya
(mm)
<malay>takde bunyi</malay>
behind [ah]
[oh] okay
secluded [ah]
okay
(um)
of course [lah]
<malay>mana boleh</malay>
wait you went you you stop to help her
[oh] the instructor went to help her
ya [lah] I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
[oh] she
ya correct ya
(mm)
(mm)
what so she crashed into the wall
skid [ah]
by point of time you stop [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
kill switch
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>siapa</malay> number one
[oh] you get you got number one [ah]
(mm)
bandana
<malay>ada muka macam mat salleh sikit takde</malay> [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
the other side [ah]
then
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
but he was in charge of your class [ah]
prac one also [lah]
[oh] okay
(hmm)
no [lah] maybe maybe they they want you to practise more [ah] before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no [lah] some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
[eh] <malay>kau jangan cakap pasal</malay> two B
people who are riding class <malay>tu</malay> steady <malay>jatuh</malay> plank I have issues with plank I cannot hit the timing
class two ten seconds
!huh! class two class two class two ten second slower with a heavy bike <malay>aku punya</malay> timing <malay>selalu</malay> nine point seven nine nine point eight <malay>habis kat aku kena</malay> four points <malay>aku</malay> short [siol]
seven seconds is fast [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> class <malay>tu</malay> you have to go ten second <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh]
okay [lah] I mean with practice you can [ah]
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already [ha]
gear gear one <malay>kau boleh</malay> reach thirty
<malay>kalau kau</malay> whack [ah]
<malay>ini kau</malay> vroom <malay>dah pergi</malay> [siol]
that's how fast a class two bike is [ah]
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly [ah]
highly harly can bobber [ah] you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive [lah] [sia] (uh) I I I tested the bike (um)
I think last year during (uh)
wicked wallop <malay>tu dia orang baru</malay> just started (um) this company called mutt motorcycles [lah] I mean it's it's quite a renown brand in in their own country but it's new in singapore
so when they they they open up their their booth
a lot of interested <malay>punya</malay>
people [lah] so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
<malay>tapi untuk aku</malay> two fifty like what's the purpose of you riding a two fifty [kan] either three hundred or four hundred [lah] [kan]
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean the the bike is
whatever what you see is what you get [lah]
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
the only ones that I know is vicious cycle <malay>ada satu dekat</malay> woodlands
(uh) #sanju#
#kaki bukit# #sanfu# #sanfu#
(uh) and I think the
ya and they have a showroom <malay>dekat</malay> #paya lebar#
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven [ah] seventeen K
[eh] sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
inclusive of [ah] back then that was last year <malay>punya</malay> so imagine with this year's
four K
four plus [ah]
expensive [ah]
definitely way cheaper [lah] I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean (uh) zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike [ah] brixton
but of course [lah] mutt is mutt is
I mean way better [lah]
<malay>aku</malay> actually try <malay>apa</malay> when I went to wicked wallop <malay>aku tanya dia</malay>
[eh] (um) if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
[oh] I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
(uh) brixton is is is a europe bike [ah]
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
then <malay>bila aku fikir-fikir balik</malay> (uh) forget it [ah] I'm taking my class two
waste <malay>duit</malay> [sial] <malay>nanti dah beli lepas tu aku dapat</malay> class two upgrade <malay>lagi</malay> don't want [ah]
but my wife tell me [ah] cause I keep falling <malay>apa</malay> I keep failing my class two and then every single time I take my class two prac
<malay>aku jatuh</malay>
my wife <malay>cakap</malay>
(um)
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money [ah]
you upgrade
(mm)
[ah] [lah] of course [lah] of course [lah]
no [lah] I mean I'm looking at my options
why [ah]
ya but super four is (uh) quite reliable bike [ah]
it is
ya no problem
ya but theirs they they it's not four hundred yes it's five hundred [eh] I mean because of singapore <malay>punya</malay> (uh) limitations and stuff so they
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> two A [ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> higher [lah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
but the one thing about super four
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> their maintenance
it's freaking expensive [ah] [sial]
for a normal two B bike [ah] okay at the max you can go is one and a half engine oil bottles I mean we don't we don't talk about class two bikes [ah] class two <malay>memang</malay> of course [lah] the maintenance the servicing is going to cost you a bomb talking about standard two A bikes or two B bikes
my my bike one bottle that means one litre [lah] so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no [lah] one month [ah] I mean right now COVID one month [ah]
back then [eh] no [lah] back then when I was working in (uh)
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
to and fro [ah] twenty eight <malay>pergi</malay> twenty eight <malay>balik</malay>
fifty six [lah] <malay>kau masuk sikit-sikit</malay> if you know <malay>jalan jauh sikit</malay> then sixty [ah]
that it took me about one month [ah] to to to reach two click two thousand click
!walao! if two weeks two weeks <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] [sia] ya [lah] ya ya
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need [ah]
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay [lah] harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
!siala! <malay>kau</malay> imagine
four bottles of okay [lah] let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
(uh) quality <malay>punya</malay> engine oil okay [lah] basic [ah] ya basic motul [ah]
motul (uh) ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs [ah]
[eh] <malay>kau jangan cakap pasal</malay> iridium spark plugs [ah]
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's about what forty eight plus hundred bucks hundred and forty eight dollars that is just every one month monthly <malay>punya</malay> servicing you know
then <malay>tak termasuk kau punya tayar kau punya</malay> wear and tear <malay>kau punya</malay> brake pad
<malay>kau punya</malay> coolant super four <malay>ada</malay> coolant [kan]
that's why [lah] I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] I'm I'm too short [ah]
like what
three ten is quite big [ah] [sia] <malay>aku dah</malay>
is it
it's nice [lah] I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
it's it's a cafe racer <malay>punya</malay> model [eh]
capacity
(mm)
[oh]
ya [lah] and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper [ah]
no the furthest I went with this bike was (um) #desaru#
the furthest I went with my was (uh) #muar#
ya ya [lah]
(um)
three hundred it depends on where you are if I think about six hundred <malay>ke</malay> four five hundred <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] but
I've heard my I mean my friends [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> case <malay>dah</malay> on the [eh] <malay>dah dah pergi</malay> on the way <malay>balik</malay> piston jammed piston seize
tow [ah]
if <malay>dia orang</malay> if <malay>kena</malay> those people <malay>yang sengkek</malay> those who don't have money
they will go for the
the dangerous way [ah]
which is to <malay>tolak</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tahu tolak macam mana</malay> [kan]
this one I I never tried [ah] I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you [ah]
so you've lift down your foot rest
your <malay>dia punya</malay> pillion foot rest
my left leg
will <malay>tolak</malay> your bike I will I will use my bike <malay>punya</malay>
(uh) power to push together
[ah]
[ha] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] I've seen on the road [sia] serious I've seen it on the road [eh] <malay>au tak pernah nampak</malay> [eh] <malay>ni</malay> I've seen it on the road so that one if if you get caught by in singapore both revoke
but I mean malaysia <malay>dia orang kisah apa</malay>
[eh]
don't talk about #negeri sembilan# benny <malay>yang</malay> deliver <malay>dulu</malay>
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders [ah]
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
<malay>dia keluarkan</malay> so his was under run in running in
so technically his engine <malay>dah baru tukar</malay> overhaul [lah]
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or (uh) a new overhauled engine
(um)
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
ya so your has to be less than seven [ha] <malay>jaga</malay> correct
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike [lah]
so this guy
<malay>dia sorang</malay> two B
the rest was all two A class two no <malay>dia ikut</malay> [siol] he was going at one twenty !wah! <malay>pergi boleh pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>pergi</malay> happy happy
<malay>main</malay> go cart <malay>balik</malay> piston jammed piston <malay>pupus</malay> [ah]
benny <malay>tolak</malay> [ah] benny then swap [ah] <malay>tukar-tukar</malay>
that was from #malacca# to <malay>dia orang tolak</malay>
no [lah] [sial] they were going a hundred plus <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [sial]
I mean the person <malay>yang motor mati tu</malay> was just relax [jer] [ah]
steer [lah] but if <malay>kalau kau kena</malay> those sticky situations [ah]
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
<malay>kereta kat depan</malay>
jammed brake
<malay>kau tengah tolak</malay> [siol]
brake brake [ah] <malay>habis kalau</malay> case <malay>yang</malay> I don't know [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] because <malay>kau punya motor mati kau tak boleh</malay> engine break <malay>kau nak</malay> clutch in <malay>tak boleh</malay> clutch in <malay>tak boleh</malay> gear down
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral [lah]
<malay>kau tak pernah tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>ni</malay>

so <malay>dia punya</malay> the foot rest and the platform so the motor <malay>boleh gini</malay> [kan]

so they will go to the back in I mean we we have everything [what] we have all the access to do it
you go to the system the change the timing to now
so it's free food [lah] and they've been doing it for I don't know how long [ah]
dishonest [ah]
that is it will look bad [ah] [sia] I on your profile
speaking of which
because back then (uh)
deliveroo APAC office was beside youtrips office

<malay>dia</malay> she backstab me a lot of times [lah]
<malay>dia gila pangkat</malay> [eh]
subtle
(mmhmm)
because because I mean how I find out was I shared with her a lot of things she go and #pao#
there are things I didn't like about the the whole how they

hey #siti#
thanks for joining me for this (err) this opportunity it's really cool
ya
it's really cool because like I feel that I feel so happy to contribute to I think it's really cool have you ever had issues with like SIRI
(uh huh)
ya ya
okay
alright I I find personally in my life if I want to search for something I will go on google I will open my phone type in the pin code go to chrome search okay why for you why is it better to go to like just SIRI
okay
(mm)
ya
[oh] so it's okay [lah] that fun is the factor that you're looking for [lah]
(mmhmm)
[oh] pretty sure [ah]
ya
ya
ya that's true
but I think not yet [lah]
ya not yet cause I heard that apple is moving towards like
you can you can use SIRI to turn off lights from your house you can turn down the aircon I think already have right
there's a apple home but it's ya but the thing is like all the you need you need if you want use apple home all the appliances you use is has to be like apple certified kind of thing
I think so but like not all no but like not all
products is here I think ya maybe they're still trying it out and then they realise that a lot of people are still buying alexa or whatever ya that's cool I guess
you know
ya
I know right
I would you would you think it'd be weird if like our <malay>makcik</malay> and <malay>pakcik</malay> were to start to use SIRI you guys like
okay
okay <malay>raya</malay>
okay
[eh] <malay>selamat hari raya</malay> okay you <malay>makcik</malay>
so
okay [lah] okay [lah] I <malay>pakcik</malay>
okay I <malay>makcik</malay> what I <malay>makcik</malay>
I <malay>pakcik</malay> okay okay ya sorry we are two metres apart okay
<malay>selamat hari raya apa khabar</malay>
<malay>ye apa khabar</malay>
<malay>baik ni daripada mana ni</malay>
okay
okay okay <malay>ini ini</malay> (uh) <malay>sejuk sangat tak sejuk sangat tak</malay>

hey SIRI would you sorry I don't want to trigger
because I cannot stop recording [ah] ya <malay>cakap</malay> ya
(mm)
(mm) make it warmer ya and then it will
it will turn it you know [lah] you need to unlock your iphone first
exactly exactly
[ah] <malay>pakcik</malay> but then right I think it would help them because maybe they don't know how to do certain things of from just by using their fingers
right so maybe this could help
big time
like
I don't know what is the movie about
ya
okay
okay
[oh] so this people doesn't have a lot of friends or okay
right
(mm)
ya
right but you feel that
I think it is a chief concern that people would meet each other less
like because they can satisfy their social needs
with ya I have been learning the dictionary yes ya
do you know that
(err) the rapper he he said on (err) on netflix that that when he was in prison like he like studied the dictionary

more than that [ah]
dang <malay>empat ribu boleh beli apa</malay> the zip
(mm)
I heard from people that the shoe for men
seven thousand
and then bag <malay>abeh ada dia punya</malay> keychain one point seven
that keychain is one point seven [ah]
I wish I have money but the truth is
to be honest to you I'm really broke right now ya ya
that's true
I I don't know what is something that like people are doing <malay>macam orang macam kerja sekarang</malay> like what industry or what sector <malay>yang orang tengah kerja sekarang yang dorang</malay> were not affected <malay>dorang</malay> like still money comes in like there was no pay cuts
there was no like <malay>macam</malay>
you know like retrenchment or what
maybe
money is still money
hospitals
[oh] that's true
[oh] that's technically a pay cut [lah] right
ya ya I mean
our frontliners [ah]
shout out shout out frontliners
(um) and I really I don't know what I don't know if I
okay do you okay you've known me for like what a a year a year plus do you think I can be a good nurse

who like (err)
who've seen like
like things [lah]
on the roadsides and I don't know I don't know if I see it would I faint instantly
(mm) it's okay
ya
so
maybe
a lot of nurses I know they are earning quite well [sia]
you
like
(err)
not I mean (err) it is a medical school right but I don't think it's like that medical school where they need ten years or I don't know is it ten years
to be a doctor

like technically
doctorate
[oh] okay
so for somebody to <malay>kalau kita panggil satu orang ni</malay> doctor doctor #tan# that doctor #tan#

and then (um) he so he has the doctor to his name right
do you because I thought all along that you have to know medical stuff
to be called doctor but then there are a lot of doctors out there
that they are just called doctor because they took
a doctorate in other things ya
ya isn't medical

I would ask for a a car
<malay>kereta</malay> I will ask for a car and I also ask for money
and I will also ask for an unlimited supply of <malay>kasut</malay>
shoes
for anything any type of shoes I would want
so like so <malay>pape kalau aku nak main bola ke main</malay>
<malay>takraw sepak takraw ke boleh</malay>

genie the people who grant your wishes

<malay>entah</malay>
<malay>tahu</malay> I know I know but then for for shoe right
[ah] since I already have money right

so right if I want to buy shoes right
the money would confirm go down right

hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
your life would be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
life <malay>tak bagus</malay> [ah]
easy to say it's like it won't be good [ah] everything will just be everything [oh] I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate [ah] so like
so like you know [ah] sometimes right you need to think about
worth it [ah]
<malay>dapat semua benda</malay> [pe]
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life [ah] for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
[ah]
I mean everybody has their own opinion [what]
their own opinions in life
like <malay>dorang nak apa</malay> like
<malay>sorang ada sorang nya</malay> opinion [pe] so like <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you know if our opinions are different right then it is what it is [ah] like ya
so first first first [kan] <malay>aku nak perempuan lawa punya</malay>
[ah] <malay>kalau kalau tak lawa aku tak nak</malay>
!chey! just joking but ya of course [ah] I want a pretty lady in my life and
<malay>hati-hati kena bagus macam</malay>
<malay>hati kena bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>macam hati dia kena bagus kena macam aku nak dia</malay> caring loving
(uh) show respect to my parents like that kind of girl [ah]
in that's what I look for in a girl [ah]
<malay>faham faham</malay>
(mm)
okay we talking about this minor details in women that I look for of course there is [lah] there are a few [ah] so I'll tell you about my life [ah] like I can be honest [ah] <malay>dalam hidup aku</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku keluar dengan tiga perempuan</malay> [jer] [tau]
<malay>tiga perempuan</malay> the first one she can make me laugh she (uh) <malay>boleh buat aku ketawa semua</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> take it one step too far she make me laugh too much
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say [lah] like too playful [ah]
like <malay>macam dia suka main-main aku</malay> text <malay>tak nak</malay> reply <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>abeh berbual</malay> serious
serious <malay>punya benda dia</malay>
<malay>dia macam buat macam kelakar semua</malay> then you know
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she [ah] <malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
handle jokes <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>kena aku selalu kena</malay> care for her [ah] like
<malay>takleh kena takleh kena sikit ke apa</malay> [ah]
then <malay>bila berbual dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>nak buat macam</malay> joke <malay>kelakar semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dia dia nak sepak aku sepak muka aku ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari gaduh</malay> so the third one right
she's a good mix in between [ah] like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall [ah]
but then turns out I'm not her type [ah] so if that that one I cannot do anything [ah] but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course [ah] every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus [ah]
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
to be needy you know like I don't want her to be too needy like <malay>selalu</malay>
like <malay>dia selalu macam</malay>
<malay>cari aku dia nak ni dia nak ni</malay>
so like <malay>semua benda semua benda dia</malay>
like <malay>cari aku</malay>
then <malay>aku kena pergi sana jumpa dia berbual dengan dia dia nak nangis aku kena gi sana semua</malay>
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want [ah] I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
<malay>cam dia tengah</malay> contact <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>satu orang satu laki ke kau takut</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
!whoa!
[ah]
feeling feeling <malay>kau macam mana</malay> feeling
happy <malay>gila ke apa</malay>
process [ah]
process your morning
you're like in a fifty fifty state of mind [lah] <malay>kalau dia</malay> reply then
<malay>kau berbual kalau dia tak</malay> reply then
<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [jer] [ah]
[ah] okay
[ah] <malay>aku kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kerja kat ni</malay>
<malay>kat kau tahu</malay> SingPost
[ah] <malay>aku kerja kat</malay> SingPost [ah] <malay>cam</malay>
<malay>aku tengah kerja</malay> morning shift [eh] <malay>tak silap</malay> morning shift
[ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa tu kerja apa aku tak ingat</malay> [ah] but then ya
[a'ah]
so like <malay>macam</malay> start conversation <malay>dengan dia</malay> [ah] <malay>cam</malay>
<malay>berbual</malay>
did she seem like interested in you <malay>dia macam</malay>
(um) <malay>ada tunjuk kau dia ada suka kau ke ada</malay>
(mm)
it was just like out the blue [ah]
it was like your first relationship is it or
first date first first everything [lah]
it's like your first breakup [ah] you don't know how to handle [lah]
[oh]
I couldn't take it [lah] <malay>aku nangis cam</malay> day and night <malay>aku nangis nangis aku pun tak tahu asal aku nangis</malay>
<malay>kalau aku fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu pun aku asal aku nangis</malay>
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments [what] but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs [what]
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like [oh] this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated [ah] some would say
so ya
but then when she
<malay>minta dia nak minta</malay> break
<malay>dia nak minta</malay> breakup then <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> [lah] like we never say anything but we there was no like
labels [ah] I would say
like <malay>kita kita tak</malay> label
<malay>kita macam</malay> boyfriend girlfriend <malay>mata air tak</malay>
<malay>kita tak macam kita macam</malay> just go with the flow [ah]
<malay>boleh cakap gitu</malay> [ah] go with the flow [jer]
(mm)
so you just became like a emotional guy [ah]
<malay>cam jadi</malay> emotional [ah]
like you just needed like reasons [ah] like you want to solve it [ah] like you don't want to just breakup
like that [ah]
like <malay>kau tak nak</malay> let go <malay>dia cam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>kau nak macam</malay> rebuilt <malay>semua</malay> you know
so like you try to you know talk to her [lah] but she didn't
she didn't like get back to you [ah]
she
move on [ah] so you just move on with your life
forget about her slowly
I mean if you're really lucky [lah] your first try you get
until to that state then you can marry that person then that's very good [ah] because like
[sial] [lah] <malay>aku pun nak</malay> [sia] <malay>kalau</malay> first try <malay>dapat macam boleh cam</malay> like the perfect girlfriend
like the perfect wife [ah] <malay>boleh cakap</malay>
so like ya [lah]
[a'ah] [seh]
this one <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> [kan]
in this world [ah]
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
<malay>tak</malay> this is different because right anything you want for free
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
[a'ah]
<malay>satu benda</malay> [jer] <malay>benda</malay> free
<malay>apa-apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>makanan</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>tak tak muak ke hari-hari makan</malay> Pizza Hut
so what did you leave her for someone
(mm)
so like you pretty much just stalk her first [ah] <malay>cam tengok orang ni macam mana</malay>
so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
<malay>ni perempuan macam</malay> not bad [ah]
<malay>cam</malay> this is the [one] [ah]
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
(mm)
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings [ah]
<malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> fade [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] that's good that's good
[ah] to be honest [ah]
it depends on how the break up went [ah]
<malay>kau faham tak macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau kita punya</malay> break up <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau punya macam senang macam</malay> just ended smoothly like no hiccups or anything then okay [lah] <malay>boleh jadi kawan tapi macam</malay>
<malay>kawan pun bukan macam</malay> best friend <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kawan macam</malay> low-key <malay>macam boleh cakap</malay> [ah] hi bye friends [ah]
<malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> technically <malay>kawan tak</malay> [ah] you know what I mean
it's like
ya
so like
but then <malay>kalau</malay> break up <malay>macam rabak kita macam gaduh semua</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> like
try <malay>jadi kawan balik macam susah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
what's the point [kan] ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't [ah]
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends [ah]
do you still searching for love or anything
[ah]
[oh]
[ah]
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh]
(mm)
[ah]
you just try to care for her [lah] like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares [ah]
[ah]
that's
that's a super hard question [ah] because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
<malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] like [ah] <malay>kalau aku</malay> just break up then <malay>aku nak</malay> move on it takes me like at least at least [ah] four months I would say
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended [ah]
like
it really depends on the person [ah] like <malay>kalau aku cam</malay>
<malay>kalau aku</malay> handsome <malay>gila ke apa ke</malay> then (uh)
<malay>senang-senang dapat perempuan semua aku tak</malay> [kan] move on
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>berapa berapa lama</malay> [kan]
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on [lah]
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this [one]
were you still moving on
ya
(mm)
your second girl your ex [lah]
[ah]
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
it's not wrong [ah] it's not completely wrong <malay>tak salah</malay> [pe] <malay>kalau cam</malay> care <malay>pasal</malay> ex <malay>kau ke apa</malay> it's not wrong it's like
<malay>macam</malay>
how you say [ah] like you like imagine if you lost your phone right and <malay>kau hilang</malay> then
<malay>tu benda tu</malay> phone <malay>kau takleh cari mana-mana</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [ah]
<malay>ni mesti macam</malay> two years down the road two years the road <malay>kau mesti fikir balik</malay> [eh]
phone <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>aku rasa kat kat sini ke</malay>
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that [ah]
it's like something that is lost can never be found again [ah]
<malay>dorang cakap</malay> [ah]
people say this one
so like ya
(ugh)
ya
totally not wrong
(mm)
in my in my relationships [ah] my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me [ah] I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like <malay>macam</malay>
example [eh] example <malay>macam</malay> one of the times (err)
<malay>ni perempuan dia nak berbual dengan aku dia sedih dia nak</malay> she needs someone to talk to [ah] pretty much so I just decided like <malay>macam tapi aku aku tengah main</malay> game
<malay>kau tahu</malay> game [kan] <malay>macam</malay> phone <malay>nya</malay> game then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[eh] [sial] [lah] <malay>aku nak main</malay> game <malay>tapi ni perempuan tengah nangis ni aku nak buat apa</malay> [sia]
so like
I I just give another <malay>macam aku kasi</malay>
<malay>alasan</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku</malay> busy [ah] <malay>berbual nanti boleh tak</malay> see like
there's stuff I did like I totally regret now [ah] like
imagine if I did I didn't do that in the past I would I might still be together with her now you know like
it's like of course [ah] I I I feel like sometimes I
I <malay>macam tak</malay> (uh) <malay>buat banyak</malay>
<malay>buat banyak salah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you know I do a lot of wrong [ah] in relationships [ah] but
you know I'm still young also like as you said like I'm still young also so like even you leave and you learn [ah]
so like [ah]
(mm)
it's like you just live [ah] like your future self think about that in the future [ah] I get what you mean
so like ya like you know [ah]
you always got to know [ah] sometimes it's not always your fault in the relationship [ah] so like
you know you always got to tell yourself
it is what it is [ah] like <malay>kalau benda tak</malay>
[ah] go the way you want it to then
sorry man
life is doesn't work in your favour all the time
(mm)
[ah]
<malay>tapi tadi kau cakap macam</malay> live in the moment [kan] that's a very
good thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> live in the moment like it's a very good thing [ah]
like you know it's like don't think too much [ah] pretty much don't put [ah]
<malay>jangan kasi kau sendiri</malay> stress <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>cam fikir pasal duit fikir pasal perempuan</malay> for the future <malay>macam</malay>

you know like this guy is so good <malay>macam</malay> #bilal# is like very nice [sia] even though I don't know him then
I don't know him much [lah] at all but I know he is my (err) mate
and he was one of the leaders last time
then
even though I don't know him right so for some reason right out of nowhere right I cry
I cry I cry my balls
my balls out my eyeballs out
ya <malay>aku nangis gila babi</malay> #dok#
<malay>bila</malay> like <malay>babi boleh</malay> [kan]

and it's suddenly <malay>macam</malay> that it it strucks [tau] it strucks [tau] it strucks <malay>macam</malay> like I don't know why I cry but then it's just waterfall
then I'm like <malay>asal</malay> [eh] <malay>nangis</malay>
no I mean that's one that's one factor but before but before that was my heart like <malay>macam asal ni</malay> why am I why am I feeling this way
I ask myself [lah]
why why am I feeling this way
then
like then when I see his body he kiss kissed his forehead
then after that you go then slowly I didn't even see anyone it was crowded also [what] because everybody was like after praying
then we have our last respect cause we all we all follow a line [lah] (err) follow queue <malay>taburkan apa entah</malay> forgot what's that thing called
[ah] <malay>taburkan</malay> and <malay>cium dahi dia</malay>
then we go and we go <malay>semua</malay> crowded like very crowded so I cannot see anyone but
I started to <malay>macam rasa nangis</malay> [tau] like my eyes my eyes starts tearing up I didn't even feel like crying but it tears up
you know then then you start to tear up heavily know like waterfall like
then ya I go then I go then I see my friend the friend cry then I even I even cry
heavier [ah] I cry heavier more then like after <malay>dah habis</malay> then my friend one of my friend who is quite close to him [lah]
he asked me #zul# (err) (err) why
why (err) your why that time <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>nangis</malay> [eh] <malay>bila arwah si</malay> #faiz# <malay>meninggal kau kau sorang yang nangis sekali dengan</malay> batch to cry heavy why [ah] [oh] I just I just say like <malay>macam terasa</malay> then
that one day ya I want to die like that also <malay>orang ramai</malay>
second also (um) I scared <malay>macam</malay>
scared of death [lah] basically
scared of death [ah] since <malay>lagi buat takut</malay> that's why my heart was beating beating I scared
like one day all these happen <malay>angkat jenazah</malay> that will be you one day [lah]
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> so
and you don't know what what happened to you after that [what] you know
only I known no one can
ya [lah] can <malay>macam</malay>
no one really to tell the tale [lah] in the afterlife [lah] basically so you have to go through yourself so that's what that's what
<malay>takut</malay> and <malay>risau</malay>
is the one is one of the major factors I was super scared [lah] you get and
some depends on the person also the person also can change
any person [lah] like like that <malay>jenguk</malay> ya emotions [ah] like also like visit <malay>jenazah</malay> also also change <malay>macam</malay> they have a new perspective of things how it's supposed to be <malay>gitu-gitu</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] so
sometimes
<malay>benda ni</malay> eventually we all have to go through
you have to <malay>macam</malay> face it that's that's how reality [lah] sucks [ah] we cannot live in a fairy tale forever also as long as we are happy happy happy one day
we but you have to expect one day
<malay>benda-benda benda tahi akan jadi</malay>
so
ya [lah] but in the mean time since we are still alive we just we just <malay>kita</malay> just pray for each other [lah] for safety you know <malay>gitu-gitu</malay>
but ya [lah]
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] [lah] I I have to share [lah] [ah] no [lah] not sad [lah] I I'm I'm way past that already [lah] ya [lah] I think about it [lah] but

but it'll be fifteen years of fun [lah] so what's usually a birthday like
(uh) <malay> macam gitu [lah] <malay> kalau birthday <malay> ni selalu we always tell people that you know [ah] really [ah] even when the adults celebrate the birthday [kan] frankly speaking !alamak! you know is really [ah] for the kids you know
it is really for them <malay> pasal macam they really get into it you know <malay> nanti [kan] (uh) <malay> bila you tell them [eh] no need [lah] anything [lah]
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like [oh] must put this must put that [oh] must sing put the candle [ah] <malay> semua ni [kan] all them [ah]

or sugar reduce drinks you know
[a'ah]
<malay> ini topic [eh] I tell you [eh] I think every young adult [ah] will know this topic very well
[kan] [kan] <malay> kita selalu gaduh [kan]
I think it's more frequent than that [kan] if only it was only every weekend you know <malay> pasal every weekend [kan] is when you actually see [tau]
<malay> kalau you <malay> tak nampak in the week <malay> pun [kan] <malay> nanti dorang stealth tactic you know (uh) <malay> behind your back [ah] [eh] <malay> selit-selit kasi-kasi you know

you know they they will just say no but that's you what you know
this is for my grandchildren !wah!
the double standard [ah] very good [ah]
[ah] so for me
no kids (uh) but I was (uh) raising <malay> itu my nephews my nieces [kan] from the time they were young [lah] (um) partly because for (err) me (err) usually [lah] I'm not around in singapore <malay> pasal
I was studying away [kan] abroad then after that when I was working also (um) I was living abroad most of the time <malay> pasal kena posting
so <malay> selalunye not here so when I'm back usually

<malay> lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say [eh] you go [ah] [ah] then you go [lah] so to be honest [lah] I spent most of my (uh) youth away <malay> pasal belajar [kan] you know away in university

<malay> tapi apart from <malay> macam bonus <malay> macam grade [kan] I mean <malay> takde apa-apa macam incentive <malay> ke or
[ah]
ya
ya
ya
(uh) is just to put [ah] <malay> betul [lah]
actually [ah] your
ya actually [ah] your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend [lah] <malay> pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu [kan] one of my friend so he was
(uh) like you accountant also (err) so actually <malay> yang hantar dia so went to <malay> belajar lepas how many years [ah] three years ya three years <malay> lepas tu balik [lah] <malay> balik then of course serve the bond [lah]
serve the bond buat accounting [kan] and like you [lah] also quite good at it <malay> dia punya bond <malay> berapa [eh] <malay> enam tahun masa tu
if I'm not wrong
(uh) (uh) for accounting
not too bad <malay> pasal pun for them <malay> dorang habiskan <malay> dulu baru pergi unlike me [lah] <malay> pasal for me [kan] disrupt (uh)
then [ah] then <malay> pergi luar lepas tu [ah] <malay> balik you see so
(err) <malay> ye [lah] for
for me a bit different so <malay> lepas tu my friend <malay> balik as usual [lah] <malay> kita [kan]
keep in touch
you know especially when <malay> biasa [lah] [kan] <malay> ada baby then baby shower
<malay> lepas tu keep up <malay> lepas tu kaya-kaya then <malay> macam every <malay> dua tiga bulan you know [eh] fed up [lah] let's go have <malay> teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue [kan] suddenly he said
[eh] I'm leaving [ah] my job
his last six years [lah] [ah]
you know I thought very good what no <malay> ye [lah] but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short <malay> apa dia jadi nursing officer

(err) I think that's just tip of the iceberg [lah] <malay> pasal masa period gini [kan] <malay> kena buat banyak [lah] I think the most important yang <malay> dorang kena buat triage <malay> macam
<malay> semua bila datang tu [kan] [ah] <malay> nanti is (uh) people like my friend and his team [lah] then they check and then they ask them [eh] you look familiar [ah] because after a while [ah]
they keep coming back <malay> tahu because now they know what to do like [oh] my back pain (uh) <malay> dapat [oh] I feeling
a bit fever [kan] and a lot of them now get full medical check up
[kan] <malay> pasal when you tell them (ugh) my chest (ugh) cannot breath sir (ugh) (ugh) (ugh) [ah] then you cannot take the risk [kan]
so my friend after a while !wah! <malay> boleh kenal muka tahu
so he will tell them [eh] you look familiar didn't I see you one month ago your over [ah]
!huh! but it's tough [lah]
because the shift work [eh]
I mean basically (err) you don't have enough people [lah]
I mean that [one] for sure [lah] it must be twenty four hours <malay> pasal you just never know when this virus will strike [kan] [ah] so <malay> sebab itu susah [eh] for your job <malay> yang last time <malay> tu so you say you cover asia pac <malay> selalunye which countries [ah]
[oh] indonesia (mm)
[ah]
[ah]
africa was actually my first department
[ah] see I'm older than you [kan] so <malay> tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk [lah] so I covered all fifty-four african countries
so I always joke
and tell people [lah] I literally cover [kan]

<malay> pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know [ah] and then #djibouti# <malay> pasal starts with a D D J
I B O U T I [kan] E ethiopia right all the way to zambia zimbabwe [ah]
so I tell [eh] A to Z know you think what [ah] fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that [one] wasn't posting [lah] that [one] <malay> macam
you know <malay> dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then go to #namibia# then go ghana then go #botswana#
then come back [ah]
then after one month [eh] you go back there again then you go to you know (um) <malay> macam #namibia# then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
[kan] (um) <malay> macam gitu [ah] but back then [ah]
[ah] you cannot stay too long [lah] <malay> pasal
got a lot of things to do [kan]
within say three days you are in one country [ah] !wah! you just pack the program
from breakfast early breakfast or you may even have working breakfast [kan]
so from that time [ah] you know <malay> sampai ke malam [ah] then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work [kan]
so [ah] it's fun [ah] especially when you're twenty something [kan] <malay> penat pun penat [lah] of course but you know it's fun get to see the world [ah] by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone [ah] I'm different era
(uh) no distraction but also [kan]
you must understand [ah] so much harder I mean <malay> dulu
you know then you want to look for somebody you call their hotel number [kan] and then you must remember which room they are in [kan]
then (uh) you cannot find (uh) where you're going <malay> mana ada Google map Google Earth <malay> ni semua right so !wah! everyone <malay> cakap [eh]
now [ah] I cannot imagine [ah]
how you all last time [ah] work without all these [ah]
and I always tell people ya you all [ah] think now life so #mafan# [ah] <malay> susah [lah] <malay> ini [lah] <malay> itu [lah] <malay> leceh [lah] you know but imagine my time I told them started work [ah] no laptop is this thing called [ah] desktop
you know then when the first of the
(uh) when internet came along and then you are supposed to (uh) surf and
do some research [kan] then you must call up
your
(uh) ya what is it service provider [ah] using modem
[eh] but when you first started at Starhub !wah! already [kan]
[ah] [ah] Starhub cuppage [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
Starhub was quite good also [ah] back then
[ah]
I've always been on
in the which department
[oh] when they <malay> itu ambil [lah] [kan]
[nah] I I've been (uh) using until today <malay> cuma sekarang supplement (uh) <malay> gunakan Netflix [kan] <malay> gunakan you know Rakuten View
[ah] <malay>banyak lagi</malay> [lah] sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two [ah] <malay> macam macam [dah] <malay> tak worth it <malay> gitu [lah] [kan] <malay> pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
<malay> budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus [eh]
[eh] good [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
now they are smart they know what to to target
I went through that whole <malay> apa (uh) how shall I put this [ah] I went through that whole cycle [ah] [kan] that whole cycle [ah]
of dora the explorer thomas the train ben ten
power ranger
twinx the magical fairy <malay> ini semua [kan] that that was I went through the whole cycle
[kan] then you have to be always referee [kan] <malay> nanti (uh) <malay> yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband <malay> lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else <malay> abang [ah] then you have to be referee [kan] then when the cousin <malay> semua datang [ha] <malay> lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>kalang kabut
then you know [lah] I'm not a big fan of letting them watch anything
on (uh) handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them <malay>kalau nak tengok semua</malay> share okay
[ah] good for you [ah]
[ah] <malay> macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right <malay> macam mana pun [kan] I mean cannot [lah] you know when ipad first started [kan] I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put [kan] <malay> dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
<malay> macam kenapa [lah] you know maybe [lah] you call me jurassic [eh] <malay> pasal I'm conservative about this thing [kan] <malay> macam !huh! why is your baby looking at Youtube [lah] and this and that [kan] to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry <malay> pasal dia punya lung
get exercise <malay> tahu
<malay> cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor [lah] you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying <malay> pasal babies are
basically crying for attention you know and once they have human touch as you know you [kan]
father of four [kan] you <malay> tahu [lah] [kan] <malay> budak-budak ni semua <malay> bila nangis then you <malay> kasi attention <malay> sikit aja semua okay
but I don't understand [ah] this parents [kan]
[ah] there must be other horror stories you see [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
exactly exactly [ah] <malay> sama [lah]
no <malay> pasal you <malay> pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family <malay> keluar [kan]
it's getting to be quite disturbing to me [lah] [eh] you know is quite disturbing [lah] no you go and see especially pre COVID when families can go out [kan] then you see [eh] father mother two kids maybe [ah] maybe got maid [lah] [eh] doesn't matter
then everyone is looking at their phone
while eating you know so to me is like [eh]
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point [ah] [oh] my friends <malay> semua marah if I
say things like that you know [ah] <malay> kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so <malay> macam no [lah] you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures [what]
right so what
<malay>kenapa</malay> I don't <malay>tak faham apa-apa</malay> you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids [ah]
said [oh] basically you can't be bothered [lah] you know to to to talk to them ask them ask them also no point they don't tell you what happened they just say okay okay okay
said <malay> biasa [lah]
[eh] let's face it [lah] you know even we as teenagers [ah] last time [kan] remember when your mother <malay> tanya score <malay> macam mana [ah] okay [lah]
[kan] despite the fact that you had two fights that day
lost your homework <malay> kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
took it play a joke on you but when you come home just say okay [lah] nothing
where is up to you know as the parent for you too
[ah] tease out [kan] bit by bit and find out <malay> semua [kan] all these kinds of things [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
(mm)
fullstop correct correct
and it's not shift work you know
you you are a parent twenty-four seven
no I think until you basically die I always remind people <malay> pun [kan] you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them [ah] you are still [ah]
a six year old you know ya so that parenting continue and so that's something I always remind
people over and over again [lah] [kan] <malay> pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off <malay> macam even <malay> lepas I <malay> hantar last time [lah] [eh] my <malay> anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
afternoon I check in [what]
although <malay> ada maid ada <malay> dia punya you know grandmother <malay> kat rumah [kan]

it's twenty four seven you cannot say like you say [lah] you know you cannot okay for two hours I cannot go up because it's my
duty you know no [lah] nothing to do with that
nothing
but I don't think it's it's just you I think (uh) there are still a small but good number of people <malay>yang macam</malay> you and that's good <malay> tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about <malay> setahun gitu for one
right cause I was an adjunct I was an adjunct lecturer then I saw the kind of (err) students that we have these days
even the good [ones] honestly [ah]
when you
you know take some time talk to them [kan] <malay> tanya-tanya macam mana [kan] then you realize actually they are quite neglected
(err) by parenting
and usually it's parenting by default meaning [ah] is the maid
(mm) <malay> tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know <malay> macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them <malay> macam manja-manja dengan teacher <malay> pasal macam
that is their their parental figure
[dah] [lah] <malay> every day pergi sekolah [kan] and even during COVID and home based learning [kan] they see the teacher still online [kan] <malay> pasal
you are looking at the laptop [kan] and what not ya and although parents now K [lah] belatedly realised !hey! you know actually
quite good to spend time at home spend more time with family and all that
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two [kan] !wah! <malay> budak-budak semua balik sekolah [kan]
no more home based learning for many schools [kan] !wah! most parents hurrah hurrah <malay> pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out !wah!

[ah] sebab itu [lah]
<malay> sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat <malay> ni semua dorang touring [kan] it's really really
!wow! you know it's really inspiring you see
ya and I do miss (uh) living there <malay> pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world [lah] you know without a doubt [lah] you know
ya
paris [eh] <malay> memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london <malay> macam K [lah] you can walk a bit a bit [lah] <malay> tapi after a while <malay> macam
[ah] boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and <malay> macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery [kan]
(mm)
correct correct
I agree
correct don't look down you know I always tell people when you're in paris [ah] look up you know ya
I mean once in a while
<malay> kena tengok bawah [lah] <malay> pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni [kan]
[ah] then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place [lah] you know so it's quite good to go
they got [lah] <malay> nanti after COVID
[ah]
after COVID even for me <malay> pun frankly [lah] [eh] <malay> lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore [lah] <malay> pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly <malay> dekat singapore [lah]
<malay> tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice [lah] <malay> pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my <malay> mak [kan] seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend [ah] <malay> masuk #johor# [lah]
(mm)
(mm) and also <malay> pun !aiya! you know <malay> boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids [kan] like I've got even (uh) grand nephews grand nieces [kan] <malay> yang dekat malaysia then its easy to (uh) go to
Legoland [kan] <malay> pergi makan-makan
relax relax you know so quite fun [lah]
you know (uh)
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen [ah] I suspect will probably
only be able to travel [kan] pergi #johor# and whatever <malay> sebelum kita boleh really go out there again [lah]
know <malay> dekat-dekat [lah] you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know (um) <malay> pasal every day before COVID [kan] between two hundred to three hundred thousand [eh] <malay> dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu [kan] <malay> bukannye satu dua ribu [kan]
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know [lah]
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right <malay> pasal apa dia punya
<malay> penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
[ah]
paradigm paradigm (mm)
(uh) paradigm about two years about two years [ah]
(mm)
ya ya [ah]
obviously [lah] but also don't forget catered also for the #johorians# who work here <malay> pasal
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this [lah] pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks [kan] so
[ah] even for your maid you know today anyway [lah] [eh] these days
as soon as you hire one [kan] then <malay> dorang buka [kan] payroll payroll <malay> nye tu [ah] so <malay> dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
[ah] <malay> dia by two [kan] when you go there <malay> sekarang some shops [lah] they definitely accept Nets which is good [lah] you know
<malay> pasal even for their workers [kan] <malay> lepas tu balik malaysia [lah] <malay> nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up</malay> [kan] <malay>nak tukar duit
[kan] when their salary is already in sing dollars so <malay> dorang !alah! pakai Nets aje [lah] <malay> lebih senang
<malay> tak susah
but you can tell [ah] <malay> macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites [kan] <malay> yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town <malay> betul [lah]
is really bad <malay> macam city square <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
(um) <malay> orang semua tengok !wah! really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully [lah] it'll be a slow and painful process [lah] but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not <malay> macam kita aje [kan] you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so <malay> macam gitu aje [lah]
[ah]
[ah] that's always good question <malay> tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me <malay> macam each one is so different [kan] so
but generally [lah] my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
you know ya <malay> pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know [lah] budget pun <malay> bukannye banyak [kan] even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type <malay> macam
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
you know you just <malay> ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know <malay> macam you <malay> tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you <malay> tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of <malay> teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did [lah] you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd <malay> lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends [kan] [ah] so for me that's where it's quite you know
that that's more it [lah] you know
but I must say (um) not so much now [lah] but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me <malay> pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest <malay> yang dorang <malay> baru [jer] <malay> buka [kan] (err)
(err) not not easy [lah] to go in [kan] that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
<malay> orang asing you know so was a lot of fun [lah] you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
see the developments but the changes [kan] since my time there and it's been what you know (uh) more than twenty years [kan] almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
[ah] [ah] okay good we are one hour already
[ah] we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now

okay [orh]
ya for me today was okay [ah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
<malay>tadi</malay>
today today was my off day
and I got like three days off you know how I told you <malay>macam</malay> I
<malay>ada kira-kira</malay>
<malay>sepuluh hari lagi</malay> left
of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) I've been trying to clear so
slowly slowly [ah] slowly <malay>gila</malay>
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths (uh) they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit <malay>macam</malay>
a bit
<malay>apa tu senget</malay>
ya
ya a bit skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
I went first in that group and when I went first
the <malay>apa tu</malay> the
I took like I think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [seh] <malay>kurang ajar gila</malay>
it's not it's <malay>tak</malay> compulsory <malay>tapi macam</malay>
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
[oh] that sucks
(mm) do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure #bo#
sure #bo#
[ah]
[eh] <malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak baca dulu sebelum</malay> you <malay>buat</malay> paper
!huh!
can like that [meh]
okay I think that was me in in <malay>apa tu</malay> in
secondary school also when <malay>kita buat</malay> lit
ya
then why you take
[ah] okay okay understand understand
okay <malay>jap</malay>
speedy <malay>ni</malay>
speedy <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini</malay> [tau] like everytime <malay>dia</malay>
everytime <malay>kita nak</malay> everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
ya [seh]
okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak cukup</malay> attention
<malay>tak cukup apa tak cukup</malay> attention <malay>kesian dia</malay>
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
but
(err) because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three shift correct
so <malay>dia baru</malay> join
so it like his first day was just me and him
because there was this other person but he <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
<malay>kena</malay>
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
ya it was quite <malay>rabak</malay> (uh)
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
I may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just I think (err)
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
(err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
<malay>nak kena siap apa nak kena siap abeh nak kena pakai baju</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>abeh nak mandi semua</malay>
I don't know [lah] I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
so anyway he told me that [lah] he told me <malay>macam</malay>
(err) okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] I told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
(um)
!wah! damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not [lah] but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait wait wait [ah] !walao! !walao!
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
so <malay>macam</malay> he was damn lost [ah]
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss [lah] I feel bad
(um) hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
(err) I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
[eh] no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day [ah]
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
my language classes then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>tak cakap apa-apa</malay> never say anything so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> give me some heads up (uh)
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve [eh] twelve thirty
then now it's like (err) three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot <malay>paksa orang</malay> to
<malay>datang</malay> and you know
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
and then <malay>macam</malay> it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I'm
my sleep is deprived
I have to really plan <malay>macam</malay> straight away after finish
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
<malay>pastu keluar lepak</malay> and then go straight to work <malay>atau</malay> sleep a bit more and
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
(mm)
<malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>kerja</malay>
ya and because my shift <malay>pukul berapa pukul tiga</malay>
<malay>tiga pagi sampai dua belas setengah petang</malay>
it's like
if I were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
no <malay>takde takde takde</malay>
no they <malay>dorang</malay> big fans of <malay>macam</malay> the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill (uh) actually
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>maksud dia</malay>
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything [ah] because it's a totally <malay>lain punya</malay> client ya
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what I mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
<malay>tiga ribu</malay>
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
ya she she took chemistry in the <malay>pastu</malay> (um)
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good [lah] I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
that I've been very complacent <malay>macam</malay> I've
like this current shift that I'm on [lah] I've been too complacent
not complacent <malay>macam terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>apa tu terlalu banyak</malay>
I don't know I I just I
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
(err) [oh] <malay>yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok</malay> the the deadline and all that
like [oh] because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
<malay>abeh kita</malay> proofreading we put everything [ah] like whether the date is correct
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers [lah]
the numbering and all that and the [oh] categorisation and all that is <malay>betul</malay>
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then I realised [oh] shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> whether they
whether they <malay>apa tu</malay>
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
volunteer because <malay>kita punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak ada nak kena</malay> #chope#
reserve
<malay>macam</malay> you must #chope# certain deliverables [lah]
ya
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of <malay>macam mana kita kerja</malay>
okay so <malay>pukul tiga setengah</malay> I <malay>bangun</malay>
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
let's say <malay>pukul lima</malay> we have to send headlines
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
because I'm the kind of person <malay>yang</malay> I cannot <malay>tunggu</malay> for people
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I'm not a <malay>apa tu</malay>
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it (uh) when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
that was last time (uh) remember I told you there was like one time in between july <malay>sampai</malay>
september <malay>ke</malay> august
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
<malay>pastu</malay>
jaded ya
just jaded like <malay>macam</malay>
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
so <malay>dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat</malay>
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
<malay>orang ketiga</malay> [lah]
no
<malay>apa benda</malay> home wrecker
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this

no I think <malay>dorang nak</malay> more natural conversation so that
this whatever can pick up
I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)
ya [lah]
no but I just
I don't know <malay>takut</malay> it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay [lah] I think it is their job [lah]

sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your

<malay>ada badan</malay>
<malay>cerita apa</malay> [eh]
yes yes yes that [one] <malay>yang tu yang tu</malay>
(uh) can watch online if you want [eh] you want to watch today
ya
why
(mm)
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that [one] will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know [ah] movies are
just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> or ask anyone I don't know
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah# #blah# #blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
but this kind of thing definitely need <malay>macam</malay> to set up to set aside like at least
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
(mm) I try play on Borderland [lor]
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
[oh] yes you're right you're right <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> #betuls# okay [lah]
(mm)
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train I bought the demon slayer masks
cute <malay>gila</malay> [oh] my god it's very cute
ya ya I <malay>dah</malay> wash <malay>lagi</malay> I <malay>dah basuh</malay>
I <malay>dah kering</malay>
I <malay>dah apa lagi</malay> (err) vocabulary <malay>boleh kasi dorang</malay>
I <malay>kering</malay> I <malay>dah</malay> squeeze dry
I <malay>dah</malay> compress <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
ya I <malay>dah</malay> I've done quite a lot of things [lah]
ya so as in it's drying now <malay>tengah nak kering</malay> I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
<malay>bawa balik</malay> [ah] <malay>mana satu yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
I I I I I only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
I ordered four
because it all looks so pretty <malay>semua lawa gila</malay>
of course [lah] but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
<malay>dia macam</malay> those who know will know right
and then people think like (err) this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie <malay>dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
ya we've talked about this before <malay>berbual</malay>
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
like you know how when it when it's <malay>macam</malay> when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
I feel like when everybody watches it
dia <malay>macam</malay> it feels a bit cheaper because like
[oh] now they are going more mainstream <malay>lebih</malay> mainstream
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
popularity of <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer for example
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
not as popular of course [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise <malay>nak beli nak beli apa lagi</malay>
<malay>nak beli</malay>
ya <malay>macam</malay> these merchandise <malay>nak beli baju</malay> you know
it's so easy to find
ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> if you if it were another show for example <malay>macam</malay> Fruits Basket
<malay>atau</malay> I don't know what's another show I don't hear it (err) hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what I'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
well known so <malay>macam</malay> that's why I say there's pros and cons [ah]
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because I don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
you <malay>tahu</malay> [kan] I <malay>ada</malay> classmate <malay>jepun</malay> in my korean class
so <malay>dia</malay>
(err)
she's very she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
so <malay>macam</malay> most of us <malay>kita ambil sebab kita</malay> either
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
<malay>kita tengok dengar lagu</malay>
<malay>kita tengok cerita</malay> K drama <malay>dengar lagu</malay> K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
so I asked her like [oh] how about ya so I asked her <malay>macam</malay>
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
and she say <malay>macam</malay>
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
<malay>macam</malay> real people
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] I just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics I think
(um) I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
the life in japan <malay>macam</malay> how was her school life or like at least [lah]
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
she's quite nice [lah] then she shared with me like about her school life (uh) how <malay>dia kerja</malay> part time
(um) like during high school and all that
quite interesting [ah] it's it's I love this class because <malay>macam</malay>
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and like the eleven year old <malay>punya</malay> remember I <malay>berbual pasal</malay>
cute <malay>gila</malay>
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
ya because like I like I talk to her about <malay>macam</malay> my trip to #yogyakarta# the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also <malay>macam</malay> in #jakarta# and how <malay>dia rindu</malay> [lah] <malay>rindu gila dengan</malay> #jakarta# <malay>tapi</malay> she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place <malay>paling</malay>
<malay>paling selamat</malay>
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID [ah]
<malay>tak kat</malay> #yishun# not at #yishun#
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
and then (um) <malay>dia macam</malay> I don't know
very nice [ah] they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
[ah] I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
<malay>sampai tahap maksima</malay>
kidding
<malay>apa</malay>
(um)
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to (um) calculate [lah] because <malay>dorang punya</malay> numbering is very <malay>susah gila</malay> it's like
<malay>dorang</malay> count [kan] <malay>dorang punya</malay> currency <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
in the thousands so like
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia <malay>sama juga</malay>
so <malay>nak kena</malay> you must really calculate [lah]
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
<malay>banyak fikir</malay> [ah] I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
exactly but <malay>macam</malay>
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to <malay>layan</malay> my korean I feel like I'm such a
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
<malay>lawa gila</malay> it's very it's super damn it's super nice
!wah! I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech [eh]
say it's for Logitech

(mm)
<malay>aku</malay> I wanted to ask you a question
do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself [lah] in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
so <malay>macam</malay> when I want to
speak
<malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
<malay>aku macam</malay> like I find it
not say difficult but <malay>macam</malay> awkward
(mm) <malay>kaku</malay>
<malay>kau</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sekarang mana ada kampung sangat</malay>
no okay do you even okay maybe you do [lah] but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
<malay>jap aku nak</malay> check <malay>dulu</malay>
<malay>yang selalu tegur</malay>
is <malay>kau atau dia orang</malay>
(mm) <malay>gitu</malay>
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows
ya
(mm)
(mm)
I think we grew up differently [lah]
[ah]
<malay>apa ni tadi aku macam</malay> sort of
[dah] off topic so <malay>aku macam nak tanya kau</malay>
<malay>sebab aku</malay> thought of it [lah] the thought just came into my head
I wanted to watch a movie because it's been a while since we I don't know about you it's been a while since I last watched a movie and then
(uh) wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
[eh] wonder woman [seh]
that's the villain [lah] for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan [seh] to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
[eh] movie <malay>dia bahasa</malay> english [lah] <malay>apa yang kau tak faham</malay>
<malay>walau kalau pun</malay>
<malay>walaupun kalau pun takpe</malay> [lah] (uh)
<malay>walaupun</malay> movie <malay>dia dalam bahasa</malay>
<malay>cina</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> subtitle
<malay>kau dah kenapa</malay>
<malay>ni mesti dah lama sangat tak tengok</malay> movie
<malay>kau takde</malay> work life
<malay>kau takde</malay> work life balance
it's gonna be so
<malay>betul</malay> [ah]
(mm) (mm)
money makes the world go round [eh]
ya [lah]
<malay>kocek kau pun</malay> round [pe]
actually <malay>aku belum tengok</malay> trailer <malay>dia sangat</malay> [lah]
but
I mean <malay>yang lain cerita semua macam</malay> boring [seh]
(mm)
so <malay>kau nak buat</malay> activity [lah]
[eh] action [eh] <malay>kau</malay> [eh]
<malay>mesti</malay> [lah] <malay>kerja duduk takkan kerja berdiri</malay> [kan]
(hmm) <malay>macam</malay> social distancing ambassador <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
[eh] <malay>tak malas</malay> [ah] <malay>nak berbual pasal dia orang</malay>
<malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) okay [lah] <malay>kalau tengok tak</malay> don't want to watch a movie then we can do other things I'm flexible
(uh) maybe we do something different [lah] you know that they have this like
you know those (uh) escape rooms
but instead of it being like interactive like <malay>kita macam</malay> just solve the mysteries
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual reality
<malay>tersasul aku berbual</malay> virtual reality
<malay>punya</malay> concept

<malay>ada</malay> different (uh) types of rooms [lah] and then I think the charges is like below fifty per person I can't remember
<malay>iya</malay> [lah]
I think it's about
forty five minutes [ah]

okay #azri# nice to meet you again so I just wanna say that <malay>kadang-kadang kita ni hidup</malay>
<malay>memang banyak dugaan</malay> life is full of challenges and of course what happens is like
we need to have a balance of our life and work wait work commitments from time to time
<malay>jadi pendek kata kalau kita ni</malay> (um)
(uh) <malay>suka dengan kerja kita kita teruskan betul</malay>
<malay>kalau kita tak suka</malay> maybe dislike <malay>ataupun</malay> there's push like this then we have to
consider of (uh) finding something else [lah] like what you have done which is good
so in short K <malay>kita nak kena tahu</malay>
<malay>apa jua yang kita buat dalam dunia ini</malay> whatever we do here okay
we have to be answerable for our own actions
same like when you go to your new work place you have this kind of situation whereby politics comes in
<malay>orang tak suka kau faham gangguan perempuan</malay>
[ah] <malay>jadi macam mana kau nak kekalkan kau punya</malay> [ah]
[ah] consistency how you want to keep your consistent [ah] status
making sure that whatever you have done
[ah] you do it you must know what you are doing you cannot affort to just like [ah] do something without knowing what you are doing correct [ah]
<malay>contohnya tadi aku bilang sama</malay> boss <malay>aku bilang sama</malay> you know <malay>aku bilangkan tadi</malay> kevin call <malay>aku</malay> kevin
kevin you remember kevin from covalent aircon [eh] kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email <malay>dia</malay> I emailed him
<malay>dia punya</malay> request for this (um) to come down to check look at one eleven [kan]
was exhaust <malay>kau perasan</malay> [eh] so <malay>aku nak dia</malay> propose based on <malay>kita punya</malay> requirements <malay>apa dia punya</malay> exhaust fan size <malay>semua</malay> [lah]
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty <malay>dia akan turun padang</malay> eleven thirty
<malay>kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu</malay> [kan]
yes correct [ah] you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
then boss say <malay>kenapa aku cakap</malay> because when I try to activate #rin cho#
he can he <malay>macam</malay> [ah] always busy <malay>kau faham</malay> he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and <malay>buang masa</malay>
<malay>tunggu</malay> contractor <malay>yang tak begitu</malay> focus
<malay>ataupun yang</malay> not really looking for all these things [lah] so <malay>aku bilang dengan</malay> boss
[ah] <malay>aku bilang boss</malay> [ah] <malay>aku bilang</malay> covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to #azri# and me about what they need [kan] <malay>kau ingat</malay> [eh]
<malay>ingat tak</malay> the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
<malay>dengar dengar dengar</malay> they are the only one [eh] that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one [tau] even Y&T <malay>tak kasih</malay> [eh] Y&T <malay>belum kasih</malay>
Y&T <malay>kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat</malay> [ah] Y&T <malay>kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah</malay> reject alright
Y&T <malay>belum kasih</malay> [tau] [ah] <malay>abeh tu aku nampak</malay> [ah] #kai long# <malay>ada kasih</malay> motor oddly [eh]
air asia <malay>tak kasih lepas tu</malay> [ah] ray #choo# <malay>belum kasih abeh tu</malay> company C <malay>belum kasih</malay>
<malay>kau bayangkan</malay> [tau] of all <malay>kita punya</malay> contractor <malay>lima</malay> company
<malay>ini</malay> covalent one company can give us that two proposal [tau] and it's only company <malay>kau faham tak</malay>
<malay>kenapa wani tak nak kasih</malay> so it means <malay>aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya</malay> specs
<malay>nak kena</malay> call <malay>lagi</malay> invite quote for the other company [lah] that's what <malay>aku nak kena bikin</malay> later
<malay>mana</malay> covalent
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tengok kau tengok</malay> proposal okay <malay>bagi aku</malay> okay not bad
<malay>dia</malay> propose <malay>bikin</malay> asia <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh</malay>
can be done [ah] so <malay>aku nak kena minta dia orang</malay> so whether they want to go or not <malay>itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan</malay> we need <malay>lagi dua</malay> quote <malay>betul</malay>
[ah] <malay>lagi dua</malay> quote <malay>kita perlukan lagi dua</malay> quote <malay>untuk aku bilang kau</malay> [eh] <malay>aku macam nak minta</malay> #lye# <malay>kasih kita</malay> quotation [sia] <malay>untuk</malay> aircon works <malay>kalau dia boleh bikin</malay>
#lye# <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>kau cakap boleh kau cakap</malay>
#lye# #lye# #lye# #lye# <malay>ini</malay> [tau] <malay>takkan tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul</malay> [lah]
!huh!

<malay>tetapi bagi aku aku</malay> still <malay>akan</malay> invite <malay>dia</malay> to quote for whatever that he needs to quote [lah] correct
<malay>sebab</malay> the idea was given by him correct <malay>pasal itu</malay> motor correct
[ah] so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
so <malay>ini semua aku nak kena</malay> standby <malay>dia punya</malay> argument <malay>aku nak kena</malay> standby any email <malay>dapat nak kena tembak</malay> email <malay>sebab</malay>

this one install okay [lah] noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so <malay>dia cakap</malay>
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain

the faulty full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost [lah]
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including for right correct

<malay>si gemuk tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nak</malay> handover <malay>bulan</malay> september [tau]
he wants she wants to handover in september like that <malay>kau faham</malay>
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very [ah]
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
[ah] place [ah] so <malay>mereka dia ada</malay> plan <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>hebat</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk dapat tempat tu tapi</malay>
she got some requirement <malay>kau nampak</malay> there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up <malay>dia punya</malay> cement twenty five add twenty five
<malay>lepas tu</malay> half of the probing
then number <malay>dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu</malay> then they want to put the
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
<malay>nak letak</malay> gas outside [lah] then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
[ah] <malay>dia dia kirakan</malay> they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
later I show you [ah] the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means [ah]
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
to the centre of the place that is <malay>dia orang punya</malay> [ah] so called short floor [lah] correct
people will go there just to buy food and go away [ah] and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs [lah]
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
<malay>jadi</malay> [ah] twenty twenty five [tau] look
<malay>lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada</malay> big kitchen so that the other half [eh] all the way to the end of the unit is <malay>dia orang punya</malay> area [ah]
no the you mean the cement [eh]
the cement will be the second half of the unit [what] second half
it means it's not the for the front [tau] the front will be rental it would not go up !huh!
<malay>tak faham maksud kau</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu naik atas</malay> [ah] <malay>naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak</malay> obvious [ah] [kan]
<malay>depan depan</malay> the shop front front would not be affected <malay>yang belakang dia akan itu</malay>
[ah] they won't <malay>akan</malay> affect [lah] because behind they have to put some
maybe they have to put some
[ah] frosted glass <malay>ke apa</malay> they have to do something to cover the behind [ah]
<malay>tapi dia orang ada</malay> intention <malay>nak letak itu</malay> gas cylinder <malay>itu</malay> <malay>sebelah kanan</malay>
the <malay>dia punya</malay> piping <malay>dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya</malay> [ah] cladding [tau] <malay>masuk dalam</malay> above ceiling
toilet [eh] <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] most likely <malay>aku tengok dia orang akan</malay> convert <malay>sebagai</malay> store because <malay>dia kata dia tak nak dia punya</malay> staff <malay>gunakan</malay> toilet <malay>tu</malay>
they can go to the level one toilet
(mm) so
okay [lah] I mean <malay>tu dia punya hak</malay> [kan] it's up to them
then they can <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> convert <malay>tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang</malay> [lah]
[ah] to me okay [lah] I mean as long as <malay>dia orang bikin</malay>
<malay>apa yang dia nak gini tapi</malay> so far <malay>aku rasa</malay> based on my understanding is like
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
[ah] a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that [oh] the sprinkler worse [ah] don't need do submission
her consultancy [ah] the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
[ah] <malay>cakap dengan</malay> fiona I told fiona as and as long as you tie your sprinkler
you do modification you need to do submission to correct
that is a requirement <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] he said <malay>masa tu cakap tak payah</malay> there is a waiver from then you must show us which clause [ah]
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
<malay>tak boleh dia mesti ada</malay> submission you must do a proper submission
yes I know <malay>dia bilang apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia punya orang</malay> gas will do a submission
[ah] to but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct

[ah] get a job
get a get a real job yes [ha] <malay>susah</malay> [sia] <malay>nak cari kerja sekarang</malay>
(err) I ya [lah] but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me (uh) <malay>pasal</malay> my wish is my need [ah] right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish [ah] to something else I <malay>tak tahu apa</malay> [ah]
you
<malay>dia orang cakap</malay> by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb (err)
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know [oh] my god I don't know how we gonna do it [lah] but [ah] I <malay>rasa dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> the struggle is gonna be real [lah] like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless <malay>kita</malay> hop on trends or unless
we have quality content [lah] but I think we have quality content [eh] I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that (err) getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I <malay>rasa itu paling susah</malay> [lah] [sia]
I think you are confusing streaming <malay>dengan</malay> video <malay>kita memang buat</malay> video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the (err) console to record the whole the whole the whole session
and then after the record like the two hours long session it will be uploaded on youtube then I download the video and then I will cut the parts where I want to use for my highlights video [lah]
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing [ah] so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play [lah] because I don't think people wanna do that yet <malay>kita kita</malay> not at that level [lah] nor we want to venture there <malay>pasal kita</malay> I think
streamers <malay>orang</malay> they are like deejays they are like radio deejays <malay>dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak</malay> inside jokes [ah] where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff [lah] but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality [ah] ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
in in the videos in the edited videos ya I think I think our creativity will come out more than we are when we are streaming [lor]
something like that ya ya
so besides the highlights so each video will have a particular game that we are focusing on and then we have to create content around that particular game
so people will be interested [lah] I I I <malay>baca dekat dalam dekat</malay> youtube <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> if you want to start something like this [ah] you have to be you have to know what you are
(uh) like you are trying to focus on [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macm kita kita nak kena main</malay> this specific game [jer] [tau] because what people want is people want
this content from you [jer] so you <malay>macam</malay> the speciality [ah] so ya <malay>macam</malay> they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a <malay>macam</malay> a doctor advising sickness [what] that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy <malay>kita nak kena</malay> like specialise in this one game [jer] and then like a random <malay>kadang-kadang kita</malay> we see if we can <malay>selit</malay> one or two games inside
you need to give like variety like that [lah] ya so we are supposed to be the subject experts on that
ya but picking that game and being good at it (err)
<malay>apa</malay> like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game [lah] ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I <malay>rasa</malay> challenging [sia]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] of course not man
<malay>kita punya tak begitu</malay> [sia] I I make sure the content that we <malay>kita</malay> push out <malay>semua</malay> quality [sia] I mean it it should provoke a feeling [lah] and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness (err) like you <malay>kalau ketawa</malay> I think that's that's quite good already [ah] where we <malay>ini kerja keras</malay> like a no brainer you just <malay>tengok habis</malay> doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad [lah] <malay>pasal kita</malay> edit <malay>susah payah kerja keras</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] the live stream [one] <malay>memang tak ada apa-apa</malay> like only live stream [one] is really moments [lor] the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
I didn't say any
ya hand me down
unless
ya wear for swimming
ya man I think
settle [sia] I <malay>dah belikan</malay> #safwan# <malay>dah</malay>
which one
(err) I <malay>rasa</malay> like fifty (err) so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because <malay>kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya</malay>
can reach like
it can range from two hundred plus to like five hundred dollars [sia]
but this [one] I got it for cheap [lah] like <malay>dekat</malay> Ali Express so that was good
I think three weeks cause it was custom made
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause (err) I mean it fits [ah] I have no complains [ah] so I assume they the custom made it [ah] cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself <malay>ukur ukur ukur</malay> ya
got your help with that [ah] you <malay>ukur kepala ukur</malay> shoulder <malay>ukur</malay> my forearms
for the kids is just S M L I <malay>dah belikan</malay> #safwan# <malay>tengah</malay> on the way #safi# <malay>tak tahu kalau dia nak pakai ke tak</malay> maybe when he's older a bit

!wah! shiok [sia] !alamak! I want to do that
I accumulate <malay>dua puluh hari</malay> [sia] you
I <malay>selalu</malay> I <malay>selalu</malay> (err) <malay>selalu</malay> like <malay>fikir macam</malay> like last year <malay>punya tu</malay> I <malay>selalu tak nak habiskan</malay> I <malay>selalu simpan</malay> for the day that I want to leave the company
ya that's the plan
my plan is always to keep leave so I can <malay>macam ni</malay> I have to serve notice two months [sia] you now at least I clear leave I serve like
one month [jer] [sia]
no [lah] from <malay>dulu</malay> [sia] I <malay>macam itu</malay>

ya we change the sink we change a sink that has a cabinet

watch any movie anytime anywhere
(uh) and you also
can watch your favourite anime <malay>tapi</malay> depends [ah]
sometimes not all the show that you want <malay>ada dekat dalam</malay>
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite (uh) show or anime
so now
<malay>apa cerita</malay> you <malay>tengok dekat</malay>
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
<malay>tidur</malay>
<malay>bangun makan</malay>
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
yes so <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> my class start at eight
(um)
the latest that I arrive <malay>paling lambat</malay> I think <malay>pukul lapan</malay>
[eh] (um)
sorry
<malay>sepuluh</malay>
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
<malay>tapi</malay> I will try my best to come school early next time
then (uh) maybe
<malay>cuba juga</malay> improve my
grades
and (um)
now I have a lot of projects so <malay>tengah nak habiskan semua</malay>
(uh)
so when do you graduate
two years
<malay>lama</malay> [seh]
(um)
I only left with
four months
(um) then after four months
I think <malay>nak</malay> apply <malay>kerja</malay>
then
(um) just
work
then (uh) if there's
(uh) school school (uh) if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cari duit</malay>
so it's best for me to work
(err) <malay>bulan depan</malay>
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about (uh)
(uh) money anymore
I
okay with
<malay>apa-apa</malay> you <malay>cakap tadi</malay> [ah]
because (uh)
<malay>dalam masa depan pun</malay> I think will continue my studies
but ya
good that (uh) I have a friend like you
(err) that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
<malay>apa</malay> you join
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
<malay>tak tak tahu kenapa</malay> also I join then when I was sec three
my <malay>kawan</malay> (uh) all <malay>ajak</malay> me go
join rugby
and that's where I grew my interest <malay>dengan</malay> rugby
so I've
played rugby
<malay>dah masuk sepuluh tahun</malay>
ya so
rugby (err)
is with me since (uh) secondary school
and now I'm in a (uh) club
(uh) #tamoko# lions
I <malay>anggap</malay> rugby as a
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
whenever <malay>nak pergi</malay> training
I can see on my (uh)
meets
ya
(uh) I recently got injured because of my bad leg
so <malay>bila kaki tu</malay> injured
(uh) <malay>kena pergi</malay> doctor
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that (uh) nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
[orh]
(um) when I was young I like extreme sport
(um)
so <malay>bila</malay>
time <malay>kecil tu</malay> my bicycle
<malay>tapi</malay> is not your normal bicycle is like
(err) then (uh)
secondary school I go to
(err)
skatepark and I like skateboarding
so <malay>daripada situ</malay> I pick up (uh) skateboarding also
so I play <malay>dengan</malay> skateboard together
(uh) hopefully that
<malay>tak ada</malay> break any bones because I want to continue playing
<malay>dengan</malay> skateboard and also maybe hopefully
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> [lah] (um) play rugby in another ten years
(um)
speaking of commitments (uh) I think
(err)
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
we live our life together <malay>sama-sama</malay> in <malay>dalam satu rumah</malay> happily
(um) I think
they are having confusion about phase three
<malay>tapi</malay> I hope that phase three is coming soon because <malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay> malaysia
<malay>tak mahu cakap pasal</malay> mask
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
<malay>dalam bas</malay>
then when you breathe and there's fog <malay>dekat cermin mata</malay>
you know how terrible that is
I can't wear contact lens <malay>takut</malay>
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
<malay>bila</malay>
my <malay>kawan</malay> like
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
I <malay>pun tak sabar nak</malay> (uh) <malay>habiskan ini</malay> COVID
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably (err) go out in an adventure
ya <malay>sedih bila dengar</malay> Teo Heng is closing down
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news [ah] fake news
so (uh) I really want to go karaoke with my friends [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (um) if it's not karaoke
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nak pergi main bola dengan</malay> my <malay>kawan</malay>
[oh] of course I want to <malay>keluar dengan</malay> my family
(uh) <malay>ajak dia orang pergi</malay> dinner (um)
and for my girlfriend (uh) probably go out on a date
you know (uh) <malay>pergi</malay>
somewhere (uh) and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
[oh]
<malay>tak pernah dengar pasal</malay> hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher <malay>tu boleh buat untuk</malay> staycation
(uh) anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
[oh] ya (um) actually
<malay>dah lama</malay> plan
(err) go staycation at least
ease off my mind off (uh) <malay>jauh dari rumah</malay> at least you know
meet somewhere that <malay>macam</malay>
I have never been before so at least
(uh) <malay>boleh</malay> relax my mind
[oh] (uh)
<malay>bila</malay> I go wild wild wet
(um)
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
<malay>kita pergi</malay> wild wild wet but actually it's different because
<malay>kena</malay> lineup time (uh) the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people <malay>dekat dalam</malay> you only can go one round
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
<malay>boleh</malay> enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go #sentosa#
(uh) go beach with my family and
<malay>agaknya</malay>
cannot <malay>agaknya</malay> bring my girlfriend along
and (uh) you know swim
<malay>dekat sana</malay>
(um) actually <malay>tak pernah pergi sana</malay> but I hope to try
(um) I'm not afraid of heights
are you
(um)
like just now <malay>bila</malay>
I <malay>cakap</malay> I don't like (uh) I mean I like heights right
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
I <malay>takut</malay>
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
<malay>bila dia tengah naik</malay> suddenly <malay>dia turun</malay>
(um) I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
<malay>tapi</malay> no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] similar
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube (err) like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
<malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> [lah] because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and <malay>nak cuba</malay>
drifting
and
<malay>agaknya kalau boleh</malay>
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
(uh) I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
<malay>macam</malay>
(err) when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
(um) my favourite car is
(uh)
(uh)
there's <malay>satu</malay> specific
that I <malay>suka</malay>
it's a M three (uh) I <malay>tahu</malay> you don't like cars but
(uh) is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
ya actually <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
my favourite car is mostly (uh) japanese
for example (uh) Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
(um)
<malay>tak tipu</malay> actually is one of my favourite
#tokyo# drift <malay>punya cerita</malay> (uh) in all the movies
#tokyo# drift is one of them
[ah] actually
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>percaya</malay> there's nine fast and furious movie
but I only watch till
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so <malay>macam dah malas nak tengok</malay>
and I watch (uh)
way before [ah]
(uh) nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because (uh) he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
ya <malay>macam</malay> for me
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>boleh suka bola</malay> like
<malay>semenjak kecil</malay> (uh)
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
(err) like twenty years
in fact that
<malay>semua</malay> of my family
support the same club
(uh) yes <malay>ada</malay> baby pictures of me wearing a
man united shirt
(um)
actually I <malay>suka</malay> club too because of the history
and (uh) the manager himself that (uh) brought man untied to win (uh)
twenty titles
man U
<malay>dah tak macam dulu</malay>
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
(uh) they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win (uh) all the (uh) season
and (err) what I heard recently
(uh) but it's <malay>datang</malay> from a rival club [ah]
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
<malay>bagus juga untuk dia orang</malay>
after like how many years <malay>dia orang menang</malay> club (uh) cup
(um) I'm not being a hater <malay>tapi macam</malay> I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
while man U have already won twenty times
if
<malay>kalau tak nak pergi kerja</malay> you can always take <malay>tapi kalau dah ambil</malay>
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [lah] rest <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
(uh) probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya (uh) (um)
hards hard time has to come first <malay>baru</malay>
easy life <malay>baru datang</malay> so don't expect everything to be easy
(mm)
ya I get what you mean <malay>tapi</malay>
ya I also
<malay>harap</malay> that everything will
(err)
go back into the normal state [lah]
and <malay>boleh dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>boleh dapat kerja senang</malay>
and everybody starts to work normally and (uh) (uh)
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> everybody at (uh) live their normal life after that
ya
I hope that good news <malay>akan datang</malay>
<malay>kalau tak</malay> we will if <malay>orang tak</malay> (uh)
stick to the (uh) rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so

#jinjja# chicken like like I think it was like a few months back
then [ah] the queue was like really very long at jewel that time #jinjja# chicken [lah] I don't know why was it so long also I think I went there on
(uh) <malay>ahad punya malam</malay>
so (um) the queue [ah] <malay>panjang</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena</malay> like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward [lah] <malay>duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas</malay> so
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana begitu</malay> but
ya like singapore <malay>memang</malay> got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated <malay>punya</malay> food places [ah] the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W <malay>baru</malay> halal [kan]
<malay>dekat</malay> jewel <malay>pun ada</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>nak pergi</malay> cycling
twelve chicken pieces for twelve dollars how big is the
how big is it
ya
!wah! cheap [eh]
[a'ah] [seh]
ya true also <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> cycling
not really sure I think <malay>macam</malay> crab meat
hot dogs
<malay>cendawan</malay>
#shiitake# <malay>cendawan</malay> #shiitake#
ya <malay>memang</malay> yummy
ya ya ya
#satay# soup base
!huh! really
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>hari ini</malay> cheat day
K ya so <malay>macam mana</malay>
[oh]
<malay>bukan</malay> B B nine [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
[oh]
(um) K <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(err)
<malay>ke cakap pasal</malay> shares [lah]
so
so far
I <malay>nak</malay> try [lah] <malay>baru</malay> try try I <malay>nak</malay> try stock then I <malay>macam rasa-rasanya</malay> tesla will grow [lah] in the future
<malay>sebab</malay> ya because a lot of countries are <malay>macam</malay> adopting (err) are banning petrol vehicles by
in the future
so
by investing in <malay>macam</malay> electric car company <malay>ini</malay> [kan] all those clean energy ones
(uh)
the shares would probably go up [lah] in the future like maybe not now maybe <malay>dalam lima sepuluh tahun</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> also low [kan] but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits [lah]
so what do you think how about you
!huh! serious
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance <malay>tapi</malay> I think like <malay>macam</malay> those stocks <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> permissible <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>yang tak</malay> go against the basic purpose [ah] <malay>macam</malay> those thoughts <malay>yang</malay> deal with (um) vices then
alcohol
you know all those <malay>macam</malay> clearly <malay>apa ni</malay>
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
that's my <malay>pandangan</malay> [lah] on this
okay for me [eh] I think <malay>kita kena macam</malay>
diversify [lah] our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like <malay>macam</malay>
segregate your assets [lah] so I think one good (err) platform to that we can use is
(uh) #wahed# invest so this is a <malay>macam</malay>
I as far as I know this is the
only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>syariah</malay> compliant <malay>punya</malay> stocks trading platform [lah] so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
commodities [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cash <malay>ke</malay> gold
<malay>ambil</malay> bonds and all these are like certified to be <malay>syariah</malay> compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in <malay>macam</malay> these kind of companies
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
you don't have to put in effort [lah] you just <malay>letak</malay> your money then you just
(uh) forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
based on my experience <malay>dia punya</malay> fees is
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside [lah] of of using
#wahed# invest
<malay>tapi</malay> like maybe this is one
(um)
how to say [eh]
what (err) things you have to face [lah] if you want to go through the halal way
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms <malay>yang</malay> offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
ya so you have to put up [lah] with this all these service charge [lah] when these banks
new way
true
maybe you can feedback to <malay>jangan</malay> invest in bonds
<malay>macam</malay> bank <malay>bapa kita</malay>
[oh] like <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>yang</malay> what you say is true <malay>cuma</malay>
I mean you want <malay>apa</malay> ethical investing [eh] in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
do it the halal way then it's the best [lah]
[ah] correct
[a'ah] deep
ya correct [lah] I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
those the regular accounts [lah] me you have no choice [what] <malay>tapi</malay> that's why (err) you have to do your own research [lah] if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
(err) <malay>mana-mana</malay> company I mean <malay>mana-mana</malay> banks
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>cakap pasal</malay> investment <malay>ni macam mana kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni</malay>

it's not it's not scripted or anything for real though it's just
<malay>kita orang berbulal</malay> [jer] like relax relax [jer] [eh]

okay
that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
like <malay>takde takde</malay> [ah] [sia]
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better [lah]
like I know the outro was a bit okay [lah]
a bit better
because the outro previously was like [meh]
ya
now I think intro okay [lah] still what my second second video
so
third third video still using the software and yesterday it kept crashing [sia] cause like I I don't know the thing the RAM was like <malay>macam bodoh gila</malay>
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that [one] eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together (uh) then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade [ah]
saw online like two hundred fifty [sia] for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
but ya it's ya it's two fifty I'm planning to buy because <malay>macam</malay> at least it's
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it [ah] [sia]
just buy [ah]
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade [lah] as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five [eh] the new Ryzen four gen four [eh] gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
so now if they go up one and then the laptop goes up one and then it's like <malay>macam bodoh</malay> like that you know then now so now it's like <malay>macam</malay>
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
!wow!
then what they release it as
the fuck [sia]
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him [lah]
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company [lah] I guess
but okay [lah] it all worked out for them
<malay>macam</malay> some of them is like really like very big but hopefully the guy gets a lot of money [ah]
free money [sia]
ya
Sony is terrible [sia] you know they don't allow discord on five I'm like what the fuck [sia]
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users

and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first [one] that was like quite good [sia]
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least

ya I mean it's it's normal [ah] I mean at the end of the day as long as the the whole world is not clear of this thing confirm got one but if you stop them at the boarder then it's fine in the end <malay>macam</malay> singapore's <malay>punya ape itu</malay> their way is like rapid testing and shit what so like for them is okay [lah]
ya
no because you know why because we were prepared because we had masks we had a lot of things that we prepared we knew what a pandemic would happen you know
and I think
not really rod it's like a more like a a a a giant dildo shove up your butt
ya
really
really
I last last week [oh] ya [oh] that means it really surged [sia] !wah!
two hundred twenty I believe was like a week or two weeks ago only [sia]
[oh] my god
because it's expensive [eh] you know COVID treatment there is like thirty thousand [sia] not like us like you go to doctor with like respiratory <malay>punya</malay> illness or whatever cock and then like you go you [ah] <malay>apa</malay> you go there again you get we pay ten dollars they have to pay for a nonsense amount of money [one] doctor's visit is like hundred plus [sia]
it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya [lah]
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals [ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like #siao# [lah]
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage [eh] only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck [ah]
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
quite quite a high amount [ah] like <malay>merepek</malay> kind of prices [ah] like here okay [ah] somebody sick just call ambulance [ah] next time can pay I mean at the end of the day it's government run so like
ya
the because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money [ah] then then but but that is unlikely [ah]
at the end of the day if they are able to like do so much for the COVID <malay>punya</malay> crisis they have a lot of bank [lah] so
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like [ah] you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late [ah] can got late payment [ah]
but there's no interest [lah]
ya
you know the new #borat# movie coming out soon #borat#
and then there's this video of (uh) donald trump's lawyer rudy #giuliani#
so the thing is right he was [ah] asked to come to the bed [ah] the hotel room of the #borat# #borat# two got #borat# and his daughter I think
so the daughter of #borat# supposedly [lah] ask him to come to the room and shit [lah]
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever [lah] so then he put #borat# put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
[ah] so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room [ah] then he was in the room [ah] then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the #borat# came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen [ah] she was twenty four [lah] but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is [oh] he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet [ah] but a few people in the media industry watched it [ah] like I because #borat# does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week [lah] next week monday most likely the video goes public [ah]
[ah] no they he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad [ah]
#borat# does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer [ah] the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video [sia] come on guys
no [ah] they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
<malay>apa lagi kau nak</malay> [kan]
why
why [sia]
[oh] they <malay>tutup</malay>
!haiya! they I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
#taiwan# [ah]
the missile [lah]
#taiwan# [ah]
ya it's always always like that [one] it doesn't do anything is more of a <malay>macam</malay> threat kind of thing
this is how countries do diplomacy [lah]
same like north korea what
no this is this is called no it's diplomacy it's called like <malay>macam</malay> firm diplomacy [lah] or some shit like that
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions [lah] it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over #taiwan# then it says #taiwan# wasn't theirs in the first place
because they keep saying that #taiwan# is part of china like <malay>jangan</malay> world [lah] bro
the only sad part is actually #taiwan# defeated not defeated [lah] kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
and then like they are not under the world health organisation <malay>punya</malay> data list because they are not listed as a country
because china is
ya ya #taiwan# isn't listed as a country of the because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china and a few other countries
republic of #taiwan# no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news [ah]
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between #taiwan# and singapore is that we are not under another country
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean !hey! are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like [eh] [eh] boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't have you seen the video
that [one] that [one] that [one] really <malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
no now it's worse because of COVID now you know malaysia lockdown you know [ah] <malay>ape tu</malay>
#wari# #wari# #wari# <malay>kena</malay> locked out of he was at his <malay>kampung</malay>
and then now cannot go back home
[ah] so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because lockdown back
so he's like then I message he message me boring [ah] <malay>kat kampung aku nak balik main</malay> computer
then I was like (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> then I like I didn't know that time that was lockdown I found out from him it's like [ah] lockdown <malay>balik</malay> then it's like [ah] lockdown [sia]
[oh] okay
why [ah] then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think #sabah# had (err) election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like [oh] that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread [lah] I guess
I don't know [lah] difficult [lah] the policies they have also not very strong so
they all busy fighting each other also so <malay>takpe</malay> [ah]
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to [lor]
to like buy stuff buy fuel
[a'ah] [sia]
[eh] come on [ah] it's one third the price bro that means [eh] I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time [ah] [jer] per week [sia] that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only [sia] instead of times three [ah] two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time [mah] you travel there [ah]
every month [eh]
but okay [lah] takes a lot of time [ah] I personally don't do it because
jam [ah]
always jam
and then the closest [one] near #tuas# and then #tuas# you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
like the Shell there and that's it then like <malay>macam</malay> boring [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
ya but can is can [ah] but <malay>malas</malay>
like <malay>ni semua nak tak nak</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> to me <malay>tak nak dia lebih</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
but okay what [ah] now got the discount what twenty percent [sia] for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is [ah] if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions [lah] okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight [ah] I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line
fuck you [lah] no
no you can just clear the thing don't let anyone bang and just leave it that's why you're not a politician okay or saving the earth the earth would be dead if you are saving it
[ha] [ha] [ha]
no expediting the process is donald trump man
sad [sia] all the green [ah] all the green <malay>punya</malay> policies that obama put in place all gone
very sad like he worked eight years [sia] for that would fight against the congress
you know and then all went to shit
just like that
not not not one person it took a whole nation to vote him
it took no it took a whole nation not to vote for hillary that was it
I'm like [sial] [ah] you all talk about emails #ivanka# also got emails what then no one cares only
don't know [lah]
then he then got mention what I remembered trump recently mentioned like if he lose the election he's going to run away from the country
cause he say he be embarrassed for losing all you know why or not he's going to run you know why
he got a lot illegal shit that he has done he scared <malay>kena</malay> indicted
as it
he know if he come back he's going to sit in jail for very very very long
because I I bet you joe biden will try his best [sia] to do it
who
who
on fucking twitter of all the places them really [ah] guess how he want the millennium will vote eight years back in that they are few politicians who was actively like in social media ya that's
I mean because obama is acting on twitter [eh] bro
ya
that's how he won the millennial <malay>punya</malay> vote [ah] eight years back he was one of the first few politicians who was actively like in
now he still now he still
come on look look at michelle obama all very ya quite influential in terms of <malay>macam</malay> presidents
and first ladies [ah]
like melania trump nobody cares [ah]
ya I mean I I don't really care about the opinion of the country that voted trump up you know
I'm I (uh) I really don't care
who
#valkrae#
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya #alexandria ocasio-cortez# ya she she was the highest the most viewed stream on twitch [sia] the most viewed stream I was like [oh] !wow! but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really [sia] she's really good [sia] and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan [eh] like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also [ah] bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say [ah] aggressive a lot of people don't like her
because she's one thing because she's a woman [lah] and women of colour is another thing and then she is like not not not like black like she's like latino [ah] and then another thing <malay>macam</malay> she very fierce
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like [oh] she's too progressive
for the benefit of the people you all don't want then you all <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] (err) reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering [lah] begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
is one point two K every week [eh]
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same [ah] it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything [ah] he's not gonna like [oh] let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
[oh] my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like [ah] the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct [oh] my god I was like (ugh) and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
<malay>tu [ah]</malay>
world [sia]
no the thing is <malay>dia</malay> world and then people still believe him I like [sial] [ah] and recently his rallies all the people wear mask wear at all but when did he ever come out with a negative test
never right
[kan] [ah]
any proof [ah] I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview [ah] like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things [ah]
like sometimes they ask celebrities like especially <malay>macam</malay> controversial issues [lah]
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation [lah] the questions [ah] then after that he got
pissed right he got angry he tweet out and then he say because of the fake news media I will release the video first before the sixty minute come out then I like that's his hit back <malay>macam</malay> you gonna release it first because he wants to say that <malay>macam</malay> they gonna portray it like differently but then <malay>macam</malay>
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes [ah] like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] they repeat the loop and you didn't realise in one hour right
[kan]
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible [ah]
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible [ah] that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
ya I mean if you say you love the bible right it's like saying you love the quran [oh] which <malay>surah</malay> you like you know then you like [oh] I don't know man like it's private then I'm like
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
ya no the thing is like no I that people [oh] ya there was one one guy you know there's this guy that time <malay>macam</malay> [oh] who you voting for like that time what he does these interviews with trevor noah like he does these interview at trump rallies and ask all these questions about conspiracy theories and whatever shit [lah]
so that time he was asking like [oh] [ah] <malay>ape</malay>
so how how's your job you know like [ah] do you believe like trump's economy will pick up and then why while this guy's there and it's like
[ah] who are you voting this guy ask [lah] like this random trump guy like so are you voting for trump this year he's like ya so how how's your (uh) what do you do for a job then it's like [oh] no he ask like <malay>macam</malay> how's your how do you think trump is affecting the economy [oh] is
making economy great my business is booming and then he's asking like what what business are you in you know what are you doing [oh] I do (uh) money money money lending
his business booms when the economy goes down what
so I think then the guy like just laugh he just cannot stop then the guy is like I'm voting for trump then he like laugh again
it's like holy shit man it's like !aww! man these are the kind of voters that vote for trump because for them selfishly their business like when the economy is like the same what when somethings go down right when there's a down turn someone earns what it's not like everyone will lose equally
so like this kind of people earn [ah] like this moneylenders
or all these like or <malay>ape</malay>
like other crap [lah] that happens
like the obviously the ones that go down like like grab riders because COVID and all these shit transport
you know public transport and shit
all the same [ah]
but like this [ah]
public transport ridership reduced what
by ridership reduce then the
ya I mean as a general the drivers don't care but as the company you would suffer losses [lah]
at the end of the day is still a government agents like it's not agencies like it's like ya is a it is govern by the government [lah] so for them they not really like going to take the hit that hard [lah]
they are not going to closed down and the like [oh] no more public transport for singapore
ya but
ya [sia]
[oh]
period who go out not a lot [sia]
ya [lah] so you just camp at the nurses <malay>punya</malay> houses then you wait

after I get the order
I wake up then like slowly go to the bike

the thing is the person is waiting at home it doesn't matter
then the food the food doesn't they don't care how long they wait they don't have a say in it [ah] [ah] most to most the customer complain
most of the time they won't [ah] they might but so far my experience is no
[ah] <malay>tak tak</malay>
<malay>dua jam memang ajak</malay> fight
then you #chao#
ya
but
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]
woke up into what about currently
you got burned bro
it's like it's like the you know there is the <malay>apa tu</malay> the video the guy Deliveroo at he didn't want to go up the stairs because this apartment had no stairs
so he wanted the guy come down then was like I'm gonna eat your pizza mate you gotta come down here I'm gonna I'm gonna eat right here
[ah] that's why <malay>aku macam bodoh</malay> [sia] <malay>jangan</malay> [sia] like [oh] my god that's why
I'm going to complain complain man (mm) you ain't coming down <malay>macam</malay> [sial]
<malay>perangai</malay> asshole [sia]
ya
but but Deliveroo is like that [ah] <malay>memang</malay> the
actually by right if got staircase then we cannot deliver up sometime a bit nonsense [one]
like
if it's like if you allow like like go up staircase like if it's one two floors is fine then if it's more than what if it's an old guy kind of like a bit busted to him also [eh]
ya that's the thing [ah] then it's like busted what then you have to come down it it protects riders more [ah]
but <malay>macam</malay> if there's a lift and then you got an excuse [lah]
if there's a lift you really got really no excuse [ah]
buildings don't have
I hate [sia] that [one] and then usually right the people who order live on the fifth floor
fucking assholes man
and then don't want come down
don't want
send to my door
yup
but it is what it is
it is what it is
!wah! [sial] [lah] that [one] I remember [sia]
that was the worst I didn't go supermarket
I was like fuck that shit
I guess sceptical help [lah]
ya
I remember during that period I went like
at like two to the grocery store
because no one is awake right
so it's like lesser people to fight with
but then the thing
they restocking around that period as well
ya
then got nothing for you
ya
ya
that's why [ah]
no [lah] mine got more mine got three or four three or four no mine cause it's twenty four hours
but mine they do the restocking at that time so cannot be two person what
the store quite big [sia] mine
it's not like like the one here the here is kind of linear what mine is like a weird shape so there's a bit of blind spot that the cashier cannot see
so they're going to have to have have two people cause one station at one area
ya
[ah] ya
ya that's the thing [ah]
[ah] okay
put the money then go [jer]
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]
scan yourself you know like
then you just go fuck off
okay [what]
<malay>tak</malay> [pe] [ah] become the cashier [ah] <malay>buka sendiri</malay> you know take out the cash
ya what you doing [ah] what you doing I'm paying for my own groceries
why never ring the bell cause I lazy bro
the starting [lah]
one point five
I would <malay>mengamok</malay> [sia] like fuck you man
no the thing is singapore water can drink [sia] the tap
and COVID is not waterborne
it was proven not to be waterborne that's why they said swimming pools were safe
ya I guess I guess so
but there is still [ah] you know
not all [ah] but a lot of them [ah]
[oh] ya
which is
that's why [ah] WhatsApp group dangerous
all this fake news
I I never really like
like some people just join [sia] random WhatsApp group you know like
the fuck [sia]
I don't know that's the thing
it doesn't make sense
but I guess that's where like they get their info that's the thing [ah] the info not verified also
I can just send some random shit that I made
<malay>jangan bodoh</malay> bro
one thing at least singapore give free mask okay [ah]
I feel the free mask initiative was quite good
two time [oh] ya ya ya okay [ah] not bad

[ah] alright okay so
<malay>semalam aku</malay> try <malay>main</malay> twenty then (uh) it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be [sia]
you know how we started on sixteen
then after that
[ah] it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
starting then you straightaway <malay>cam dia kasi kau</malay> options <malay>nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni</malay> so everything was <malay>macam</malay> flow after flow after flow after flow okay
<malay>semalam aku</malay> try <malay>main</malay> it's not like that [sia]
so [ah] <malay>apa tu kau dah</malay> create everything <malay>semua</malay> once <malay>kau dah</malay> start the game yet and everything and whatnot [kan]
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so (uh)
<malay>apa tu</malay> positional positional training tactics [kan] they give you multiples multiple <malay>apa tu</malay>
set of tactics to use and #gegenpress# #tiki-taka# all all pre-default
okay but then
tactic <malay>kau pilih sendiri</malay>
so formation <malay>apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri</malay>
(mm) so there's more tactical freedom [lah] in that sense
no that that is still [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they give you pre-default (uh)
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever [lah] so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> style <malay>kau nak main</malay> in that game for your players to play [kan]
can depend [lah] so let's say this game <malay>kau main</malay> #tiki-taka# four three one
four two three one
then the next game <malay>kau nak main</malay> #gegenpress# four two three one <malay>pun boleh</malay>
so there is no restrictions on that however
[kan]
(uh)
<malay>yang</malay> #gegenpress# #tiki-taka# is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink <malay>kalau</malay> these two <malay>tak</malay> interlink
<malay>kau nya</malay> formation <malay>tak leh</malay> work
(mm)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kalau kau buat gitu</malay>
it also depends on <malay>kau punya</malay> team <malay>punya apa tu</malay> familiarity of the tactics [ah]
<malay>ada ada</malay> [ah]
(mm)
yes
!wah! <malay>itu aku belum</malay> check [sia] actually
but <malay>yang</malay> what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] there's this [one] player <malay>dia punya</malay> role is a central midfielder
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything [kan] this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
[ah]
so
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> their own behaviour in the games [lah] how they will react in the game [ah]
I have yet to check spanish league
but then most of the minor minor leagues [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I see I go to the austrian league <malay>ke</malay> I go to the
belgian I think belgian league don't have then (err)
all those minor minor small small leagues [lah]
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game [lah] yesterday [lah] I mean
<malay>aku balik</malay> [jer] <malay>dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus</malay>
I tried a few clubs [ah] yesterday like (err) #dortmund#
then I switch over to (uh) chelsea then I switch over again to #zagreb# then switch over now I'm back at #dortmund#
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to [lah]
was four years [orh]
that's four years difference you know
in the span of <malay>apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam</malay> [sia] <malay>dorang</malay> improve
[siol]
<malay>dah empat tahun</malay> [sia]
<malay>kalau tak salah dah lima tahun</malay> [siol]
sixteen will be come out fifteen [pe] [ah]
<malay>tu kau masih</malay> poly so <malay>bila kau masih</malay> poly [kan] (uh)
<malay>tu kau</malay> year three <malay>aku</malay> year one so that means ya it's been five years [ah]
(uh)
by right they should be launching in september october [lah] but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so (err)
it will be quite late [lah] I mean for now <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> download epic games it should be free [pe]
twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
[ah] so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first [ah]
at the end of day it's free [pe] if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one [pe]
<malay>aku dah cakap dengan kau dia</malay> free
<malay>aku tak</malay> check
cause <malay>aku tahu</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> laptop <malay>yang</malay> I buy is meant for gaming
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
NVIDIA <malay>ada ada</malay>
<malay>semua ada</malay> [ah] all settle already
but should be <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] cause on my old laptop <malay>yang aku nya</malay> graphic card is based on intel's graphic card [tau]
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
cannot do anything <malay>punya</malay>
still can be able to run sixteen so I feel like it should be fine [ah]
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
highly on graphic I mean you know <malay>nya</malay> graphic <malay>macam mana</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya</malay> avatar <malay>nya muka dah macam</malay>
[ah] then after that your players <malay>pun lari dia pun macam</malay> you you know [lah] the graphic is
<malay>macam mana</malay> [kan] so
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot [lah] cause graphic is very very minimal
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is (uh) <malay>kau nak kena ada banyak</malay> data <malay>untuk kau nya</malay> computer [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> computer <malay>kau tak ada</malay> data then
<malay>macam tak ada</malay> space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then <malay>tu yang</malay> problem [ah] but
if <malay>kalau</malay> computer <malay>kau aku rasa ada</malay> memory then
should be no issue [ah]
it's quite big [ah]
okay
<malay>macam</malay> slack <malay>sana sini</malay> in <malay>bola aku tahu</malay> but I
<malay>itu aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] how it will turn out [lah] but then
you can try at least [ah] maybe when you play the game then <malay>cara</malay> player <malay>dia jalan semua</malay> will be a bit
lag <malay>sana sini</malay> but on top of that
I think should be no issue already [lah] cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
<malay>tu</malay> touch
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
not here not there <malay>punya</malay> type of products [kan] then I would see why phone will not be able to <malay>tahan</malay> by itself [lah] cause (uh) it's
very very detailed
it's there is too much detail in one team <malay>abeh kau tahu dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>kau main</malay> [kan] is just
okay player <malay>kau gini</malay> backroom <malay>kau</malay> happy <malay>dah sudah</malay>
settle <malay>sekarang dah tak</malay> [siol]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] that player <malay>ada ada</malay> core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
outliers
<malay>macam</malay> this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
so you have to push him into the social league [ah] into social group <malay>kalau tak</malay> you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
[ah]
so they add a psychological concept to the game [tau]
so then your core players [kan] the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything [kan]
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
<malay>habis</malay> [ah] backroom <malay>kau terus habis</malay> [ah]
they influence influence influence influence <malay>terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang</malay>
[ah]
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game [ah]
no cause
okay you see [eh] it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest [tau]
so that means <malay>dia dia kirakan macam</malay> the senior of the group [tau]
okay so then <malay>kalau kau</malay> bring in a fresh new guy let's say (uh) you bring another senior player from this team <malay>masuk</malay> your team [eh]
<malay>takde gunanya</malay> cause
<malay>kau</malay> senior <malay>kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau</malay> junior <malay>juga apa</malay>
[ah]
[ah] then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my #dortmund# case is
#hummels# was from #bayern# [pe]
then but before that he was from #dortmund# so <malay>bila dia balik</malay> #dortmund# straightaway <malay>dia masuk balik</malay> as a influential player
a senior in the sense <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say <malay>kau bawa</malay> (uh) young players like #mbappe# over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there [pe]
[ah] so no matter how good he is he still get outlier <malay>macam aku punya</malay> #dortmund# <malay>sekarang</malay> #sancho# is an outlier
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
so <malay>macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam</malay>
it's like me when I was in the navy <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
(mm)
(mmhmm)
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club [lah]
cause <malay>kau tahu</malay> players [kan] <malay>dorang ada dia punya</malay> own friends <malay>ke apa benda ke</malay> so then they have their own players that they are closed with <malay>macam kawan gitu</malay> [kan] so then <malay>kalau</malay> maybe
you bring him to a new club <malay>yang</malay> (uh)
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new [pe] even though he's old
but then <malay>kalau kau ada</malay> player <malay>macam dia suka</malay> let's say he favours (uh) I will give you buckley [lah]
okay <malay>kau</malay> bring him to the club buckley <malay>ada</malay> then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group <malay>yang penting</malay> is they join the social group
in a sense [lah] cause it will affect your dressing room <malay>nya</malay> happiness [ah]
so <malay>kalau</malay> dressing room <malay>kau tak</malay> happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat #barcelona# five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during #barcelona# eight two defeat to #bayern# #munich#
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
so your dressing room <malay>nya</malay> happiness actually
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team [lah]
(mm)
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september <malay>tak salah aku</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
no no no no no no
once <malay>kau</malay> free install it's free forever it's like (uh) playstation Xbox membership
<malay>kau</malay> download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library <malay>kau</malay> uninstall <malay>kau</malay> install <malay>balik pun</malay> the game is still be free
cause you already technically purchase for it already
(mm)
but then let's say you have (uh) twenty on your steam account okay
your twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam (uh) epic games account
you can you can try [ah] I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow [lah] cause
it's quite a big game [lah] but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me [lah]
it's not your laptop <malay>nya</malay> LAN cable [pe] it's <malay>kau punya</malay> router <malay>nya</malay> cable [pe]
[ah] seriously
<malay>merepek</malay> [pe]
computer <malay>kau berapa lama</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] K K K K
okay [ah] then those things do not need high internet speed everything
[ah] then I don't think that [one] can run [lah]
no Zoom lag it's not cause of <malay>kau punya itu</malay> Zoom will lag only cause of <malay>kau punya</malay> connection
[ah]
laptop <malay>kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak</malay>
internal cleaning [tau]
cause <malay>kadang-kadang kalau</malay> laptop <malay>kau</malay> is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I <malay>tak</malay> I mean
there's a few things that affect your your computer speed [lah] so dust is one thing
and then after that (uh) the make and model if it's outdated then
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] [sia] <malay>kau nak tu</malay> it'll be damn slow [ah]
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst [lah] I mean
that game is very intensive [sia] data <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> on <malay>tiga</malay> league [eh] <malay>aku</malay> port <malay>aku buka empat</malay> league four players per league [eh] <malay>aku nya</malay> computer speed [jer] <malay>dia punya</malay> processor speed [kan] for the whole for the whole game <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dah</malay> four star
<malay>empat</malay> league [jer] [tau]
so it's very
it's quite intensive [lah] [ah] [ha]
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>malam aku tak kesah</malay>
<malay>aku balik</malay> [jer] <malay>terus aku boleh jumpa kau</malay> [ah]
<malay>abeh kau fikir aku</malay> familiar [ah] <malay>kirakan aku pun baru ambil</malay> download [jer] <malay>semalam</malay>
[eh] [eh]
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay <malay>aku tak</malay> I never touch the app
<malay>aku tu dah jumpa kau</malay> [pe]
correct <malay>aku</malay> download <malay>aku jumpa kau</malay> after <malay>aku kita berbual semua</malay> and everything <malay>aku balik dah pukul satu pagi</malay>
<malay>aku buka tu</malay> computer <malay>aku tukar</malay> cup <malay>sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi</malay>
<malay>main apa</malay>
ya in a sense [ah]
[oh] okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again [lah] to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on [kan] so
there is that thing [lah] I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab [kan] <malay>yang</malay> came out
in this version was the medical centre
[ah] so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
no <malay>kau</malay> maybe let's say (uh) okay cause <malay>kau tahu</malay> you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad [pe] so <malay>kau boleh</malay> remove filter [ah] hide injured players
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot [lah] I haven't really jump into medical centre yet [lah] you can explore it later [ah]
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
technically you are <malay>apa</malay> [kan] <malay>bodoh</malay>
[ah] <malay>tu kau nak</malay>
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker [eh] !whoa! that would be damn good
[oh] you just press play play play play for ages [siol]
[oh] ya there is a singapore league inside [ah] ya
[eh] <malay>kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat</malay> singapore [pe]
[ah] you
I mean this is a precedented situation [pe]
<malay>dulu kau boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> coronavirus you can just go around and [ah] <malay>beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stuck [lah] unless they didn't go home they stay in your country [ah]
[ah] then <malay>gitu</malay> maybe (uh)
<malay>kau ada</malay> chance [ah] to play and whatnot [lah] but if
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle [lah] I mean [ah] like like there's one club
in twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
[eh] <malay>apa tu</malay>
half your squad missing [ah]
[ah]
all the north [ah]
even the north south are not semi-pro [tau]
they are pro you know
maybe if <malay>satu hari</malay> you go lower than that <malay>baru</malay> you come out with a semi-pro club
fall from grace [ah] I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off [ah] their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with [ah] cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end [lah] cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
[ah] crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so even if you win games your point <malay>kena</malay> deducted
so you end up still going down [pe]
(mm)
it depends [lah] cause
unless you
liquidate the club [ah]
unless you dissolve the club [ah]
<malay>takde</malay>
no
until someone else <malay>macam</malay> you know what
I buy over your club
<malay>atau</malay> they pump <malay>atau</malay> your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
<malay>dah sudah</malay>
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated [kan] cause of the financial fair play rules (uh) you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time <malay>tu</malay> championship which needs five K
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K [pe] just nice your club will stay afloat
but whether your club <malay>kat dalam</malay> [ah] the club <malay>kau ada</malay> loss <malay>ke ada</malay> profit <malay>ke</malay> [ah] there it
<malay>tak kira dah</malay> cause at the end of day
<malay>kalau</malay> player <malay>kau</malay>
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue [ah]
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down [ah] until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial [ah]
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent [one] was this italian club I forgot what club it was
so they face financial difficulties they were in #serie# [ah]
okay #serie# A
okay so <malay>dah tinggi</malay> [pe] <malay>kirakan</malay> #serie# A [pe] <malay>dia</malay> up there [tau] and then
[ah]
<malay>itu lain</malay> [lah] <malay>itu tak kira</malay> [lah] <malay>bodoh</malay>
[ha]
third corruption
okay so what did club did was [ah] they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
[ah] to stay afloat [lah] so (uh) what #juventus# did was #juventus# pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist [ah] <malay>terus hilang</malay>
<malay>nari ada</malay> club <malay>esok takde</malay> club [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
so <malay>terus takde</malay> [ah] then club <malay>dia hilang</malay> that's one thing so (uh) what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan <malay>kasi berapa ke</malay>
that you know [lah] some of the fans in this club [kan] quite rich [pe] so <malay>dorang kata</malay> okay you know what <malay>aku suka</malay> club <malay>ni</malay> but then <malay>sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit</malay> okay [ah] <malay>aku</malay> pump <malay>duit</malay>
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
[ah] then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again [ah]
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing [ah]
but it is possible [ah] like clubs like
wimbledon wimbledon [ah] that is a new club by itself
cause they split from dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this [ah] where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues [lah] I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this [lah]
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this [ah] (err) one particular example I know is dons [ah]
dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then [ah]
but <malay>ada ada yang lain</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> really <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] [sia] <malay>kau kena kau kena</malay>
<malay>cari sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>tu aku</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada ada</malay>
english
<malay>kita ada</malay> [sia] actually
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself <malay>apa</malay> so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
<malay>kita mimpi</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
at the end of day <malay>kita semua</malay> semi-pro [sia]
I mean
if you're passionate about it then okay [pe] <malay>macam</malay>
look look at our situation
you used to [lah] still am [lah] so it's a difference
<malay>dah gemuk cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dah gemuk tak yah</malay> [lah]
definitely [ah] I mean look at your size
<malay>tu masuk angin bodoh tu bukan banyak makan</malay>
ya [lah] it's cause
no [lah] maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile [pe]
so then <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change [lah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kau baru nak cakap</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah]
<malay>dalam empat tahun</malay> [jer] [lah]
I
<malay>aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main</malay> [ah] I mean
<malay>sekarang dengan</malay> situation <malay>gini camne aku nak main bola</malay> [sia]
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal [kan] before the pandemic situation [ah] then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
so what this guy did was <malay>dia tak</malay> slide [ah]
okay so imagine the players charging towards you [eh] running with the ball and everything
I'm in front of you I cannot slide <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> slide tackle <malay>kau</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku baring</malay> on the floor [ah]
<malay>aku baring</malay> [jer]
<malay>terus</malay> bola will hit <malay>badan aku kau</malay> will jump over me <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>aku bangun</malay> I take the ball run away [ah]
idea [kan]
<malay>terus yang dia cakap dengan aku terus aku cam</malay>
<malay>aku tak pernah dengar</malay> [sia] <malay>orang buat gini kau</malay> first time [siol] <malay>abeh macam</malay>
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
<malay>boleh boleh</malay> cause
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least [tau]
<malay>takde</malay> time [kan]
no [lah] I mean
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean
at the end of the day
<malay>memang gitu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>apa kau nak buat</malay> [kan]
<malay>kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit</malay> I mean <malay>tengok kita sekarang</malay>
no [lah] <malay>yang</malay> the <malay>apa tu</malay>
one thing <malay>yang</malay> we need to go and find [kan] is that cup #lee hsien loong# used
[eh] <malay>tu cawan bagus</malay> [siol] <malay>kau minum</malay> [jer] <malay>kau tukar kau boleh berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>bahasa lain</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
solid [sia]
<malay>dia boleh</malay> [pe]
<malay>dia boleh</malay>
<malay>dia empat-empat semua boleh</malay>
<malay>kau tak</malay> I mean the the election before the previous election [kan]
I forgot which year that was [lah] (err)
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten [ah] around there [lah]
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so [ah] every other party [kan]
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight #suria# and the #vasantham# channel so (uh) every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the
all across all four channels #lee hsien loong# face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him [ah]
it was a thirty minutes speech
<malay>abeh</malay>
I would listen to <malay>melayu</malay> if I somewhat understood #chim# malay [lah] I mean <malay>kau tengok</malay> when I had to go for the interview in malay [eh] <malay>nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> #gabra# [siol]
<malay>aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit</malay> so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing [ah] so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then [oh] okay sorry <malay>nak kena berbual melayu</malay> so <malay>nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa</malay> word <malay>ni</malay> [eh]
<malay>takpe aku keluarkan</malay> english word [ah] then I speak english again so it's very
ya I mean
no [lah] I mean okay you see [eh] for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation [eh] for our generation [ah] at the most [ah]
our first language is usually english
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids <malay>macam hari tu aku pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>aku gi pancing</malay> [pe] <malay>kat</malay> #changi# [kan]
<malay>aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan</malay> each other [kan] they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether <malay>itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu</malay> cause <malay>dia berbual</malay> english [kan] <malay>dia nya</malay> english was
quite solid
okay it's
better than our parents [lah] in a in a sense [lah] cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay <malay>ni budak melayu</malay> and then <malay>budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu</malay>
so these are the kids where
their the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
<malay>melayu</malay> is a first language english is their second language
so obviously you only remember your first language [pe] cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
so there's a chance <malay>bila kita dah tua</malay>
<malay>kita tak akan ingat</malay> any other language except for
english [ah] cause
that's the language that we are used to
but then you weren't in malaysia <malay>apa</malay> you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
from but you said in [ah]
probably [ah] babe
I don't think it's depending on [ah] your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in [lah]
language that you use most often cause let's say [kan]
for example [lah] <malay>kita tak tahu berbual melayu</malay> at all <malay>dia langsung tak ada melayu</malay> okay <malay>kita cuma boleh berbual</malay> english
[ah] so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english [ah] okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language [pe] english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english [pe]
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a this is the language they use everyday
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay [pe] maybe that <malay>makcik</malay> was <malay>sebab apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia belajar</malay>
english <malay>dengan dari tempat lain</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> forever concentrate <malay>dengan</malay> english
[ah] <malay>abeh kita tak tahu</malay> [pe] anything can happen [kan]
[ah] <malay>ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak</malay> [kan] <malay>apa gunanya aku berbual</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak</malay>
I mean at the end of day also
all these old people <malay>kalau</malay> you actually listen to them talk [kan] some of them do make sense [lah] I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time <malay>merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>dengar</malay>
ya <malay>sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik</malay>
[oh] <malay>dia jiran kau</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tu kau boleh buat</malay> member
<malay>aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini</malay> so <malay>aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana</malay> okay [lah] <malay>aku dah tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia</malay> [ah] it can be like that [pe]
he will do [one]
okay but
I mean
all I see <malay>tadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni</malay> [kan] <malay>aku sesat</malay> (uh)
<malay>aku</malay> dah <malay>masuk</malay> lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there <malay>aku</malay> stuck <malay>dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok</malay>
<malay>tingkat mana</malay> [sia] <malay>dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas</malay> then in my mind
eleven or eight eleven or eight [ah] screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down [pe] it's better than coming up [kan] the stairs [kan] okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
[ah] thank god
correct house [eh] <malay>kalau tak malu</malay> [sia] <malay>aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan</malay>
<malay>kau tahu</malay> last <malay>aku datang rumah kau bila</malay> [ah]
time <malay>kau</malay> [tau]
time <malay>kau</malay>
time <malay>kau</malay> CISCO <malay>aku tak datang rumah kau</malay> [tau]
<malay>ada sekali kau datang</malay> [eh] no there was one before after <malay>kau</malay> CISCO <malay>juga aku baru masuk</malay> so time <malay>kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak</malay>
<malay>balik rumah kau nak</malay> change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so <malay>aku teman kau aku datang rumah</malay>
then <malay>aku lepak-lepak kat</malay> living room <malay>kau</malay>
second time was cause <malay>kita nak keluar makan dengan</malay> parents <malay>aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa</malay> that was the only two times [ah]
to sit down and properly <malay>lepak dalam rumah kau ni</malay> the last time I did that <malay>kita masih</malay> secondary school
I can tell [lah] I mean
most of time <malay>aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah</malay> [pe]
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a [ah]
a cycle to work to look forward to [lah] everyday [lah] but now is just
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
I mean
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] the situation <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] you've been unemployed longer than I have
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside [lah]
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
!haiya!
it's a shame [ah]
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
!whoa!
<malay>teruk</malay> [siol]
<malay>macam kau tahu sekarang</malay>
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere [kan]
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kapal terbang dia keluar</malay>
<malay>pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik</malay> [ah] <malay>tak gi mana-mana</malay>
no just to maintain airtime and to <malay>apa tu</malay> free up [ah] parking space
cause <malay>kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang</malay> for very long
it can run down <malay>macam</malay> let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes [ah]
(mm) so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
which is why most of their [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> employees all retrenched
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different [pe] everyday you have to use your vessel
<malay>kau masuk</malay> if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
(mm)
no [ah]
it's still quite low [lah] but it's not
that low also [lah] I mean
<malay>kau tak leh</malay> compare
car oil and (uh) jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference [ah]
from how many litres to how many of litres [ah] so
<malay>ada beza dia dok tu pasal</malay>
<malay>mahal</malay> that's why they
<malay>terpaksa buang orang sana buang orang sini</malay>
no [lah] that [one]
it really depends on current situation [ah] I mean
as of now damn slow [ah]
to pick up [ah]
honestly this situation is worst when corona [ah] worst than SARS [pe]
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently government
ban the postal service from sending masks to every household in america
so the <malay>apa tu</malay> the postal <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] <malay>aku nak buat</malay> deed good deed so [ah] <malay>aku nak</malay> send out
free masks to every household just for free [ah] <malay>aku</malay> send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no <malay>aku tak</malay> approve <malay>ni tak boleh</malay> masks <malay>tak</malay> work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside <malay>macam</malay> fish nets
<malay>kau tahu</malay> fishing net [kan] <malay>ada lubang lubang tu</malay> [kan] so mask <malay>dia berlubang</malay>
and then <malay>kau pakai</malay> so case <malay>kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kau masih pakai</malay> mask
[ah] so then the
this this lady was saying !wah! this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello [ah] [seh] they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing [lah] so I
[ah] <malay>ye</malay> mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
think logically [lah] I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with

is that is that the in thing right now
[oh] I mean
I mean <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>aku betul juga</malay> now now that you now that you mention about (err) last time when we were in school we
used to explore things during primary school [kan]
<malay>sekarang aku baru ingat balik</malay> actually ya [lah] actually quite true [lah] <malay>macam aku</malay> used to
primary school <malay>aku dulu kat</malay> #katong# <malay>punya</malay> area [kan] then
then there was <malay>macam</malay> a lot of
<malay>macam</malay> drains <malay>ada banyak longkang-longkang besar</malay>
so that time <malay>tengah</malay> primary school <malay>tengah pendek kecil</malay> [kan] so like
after school <malay>nanti main bawah longkang masuk bawah longkang</malay> then <malay>keluar dekat lagi satu punya longkang punya</malay> area <malay>keluar kat luar</malay> [jer] [kan]

I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that [lah] so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought (um) monday since since (uh) like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay [lah] the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night [lah] night shift like I can work from eleven to
(err) eleven to I think
seven [ah] seven seven eleven near
near my house [lah] near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny [leh] I I didn't
I didn't get a reply [ah] they didn't reply me it's actually
I thought <malay>macam</malay> I thought like I thought
<malay>macam</malay> like seven eleven jobs is easy to get [kan] but
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get [seh] I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job [kan]
[ah] yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're (err) ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so [ah] it's easy for me to
to work somewhere in (uh) plaza <malay>singapura</malay> [lah] plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then I can (err) it's
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier [lah] so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which (uh) which location you prefer
then
!huh!
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
second they called me they say which [ah] which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then
they send my resume to plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then
now I'm waiting for another call [lah] then they so far never call they're taking quite some time [ah] I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true [lah] true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that (err) right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that (um)
some people are not really serious about the job [lah] they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point [lah] so
that's what my mother said [lah] then I I think I think quite
true [lah] like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
(err) I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they [ah] (um)
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
(err) diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary [lah] a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs [lah] so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya [lah] of course [lah] I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like (um) if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time [lah] I will I will do (mm)
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently [lah] I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up [lah] definitely like (um)
ya getting easily more tired or you know like (um)

a lot <malay>dah tukar</malay> [lah] I mean a lot of a lot of changes [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> singapore <malay>dulu dengan</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> a lot of changes [lah] <malay>cara</malay>
<malay>cara hidup sekarang sekarang</malay>
<malay>makin laju</malay> everything became became faster
then <malay>macam</malay> everybody rushing then <malay>macam</malay> like
<malay>aku</malay> feel last time was more (um)
was more relaxed [lah] more
laid back chill ya
so (um)
COVID I mean
<malay>ke</malay> time lockdown [eh] time lockdown I (uh) lockdown period I think
(mm)
(mm) <malay>takut tak</malay> [lah] I mean
apocalypse no [lah]
ya actually <malay>aku</malay> actually I I thought of that also [lah] I mean I I already
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing [ah] nothing much [lah]
I I was just trying to get along earn money [lah] you know ya
ya
[oh] okay okay okay ya the first the very first (um)
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one [lah] phase one circuit breaker was
was ya [lah] it's a bit a bit (um)
a bit stressful [lah] stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
[oh] circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like [ah] I I don't care [lah] I will still go out [lah] I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that [lah] I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing [lah] then I I
you know I I I decided to <malay>macam</malay> I came to
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing [lah] so it's not like
it's not something you can like <malay>belek</malay> here <malay>belek</malay> there and like go
just go out you know like
(um)
and not get caught or what <malay>macam</malay>
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also [lah]
ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [ah] [eh] I remember I remember those times [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
weird [lah] you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly (um)
(hmm)
(mm)
ya (mm) definitely different
different time [lah] you know (err) nobody
nobody expected this to happen [lah] so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed [lah] that time they a lot of people stressed (err) a lot of (uh)
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry [lah] then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct (mm)
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs [eh] actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like #tampines# interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from #tampines# interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like (um)
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
(err) cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
(err) hopeless [lah] you feel quite sad [lah] like like like <malay>macam</malay> like
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot (uh) like harder
times [lah] a lot of people going through like more hardship [lah] you know that
if you think you are like
<malay>macam</malay> going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship [lah] like
quite sometimes I feel quite (um)
I just feel quite sad [lah] sometimes when I see all this [lah] ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced [lah] forced to
forced to stop working and
ya that one ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [lah] there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of <malay>macam</malay> views on that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
will say different things [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
like nature nature telling us something <malay>ke apa</malay> you know that kind of thing so
ya but anyway like (um)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] we just have to make the best of it [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya [lah] but <malay>sekarang</malay> I mean (um) ya definitely <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>aku baca dekat</malay> news
<malay>aku baca dekat</malay> (uh) yahoo news that <malay>macam</malay> a lot of a lot of deejays <malay>yang main</malay>
a lot of like (uh) house deejays I mean like resident deejays <malay>yang main dekat macam</malay>
<malay>dekat</malay> fullerton <malay>dekat</malay> you know <malay>dekat</malay>
wherever [lah]
ya ya all the deejays <malay>yang</malay> spin
<malay>semua</malay> most of them out of job [lah] <malay>habis</malay>
from earning like <malay>macam</malay> like
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business [ah] catering business they do sell
like food online or online or <malay>macam</malay> food delivery online then
ya then it's not only that [lah] (uh) basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped [lah] then no cannot get money [lah] music business
bars and all that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> whatever that has music [ah]
so the next thing that
actually <malay>macam</malay> counter that thing <malay>yang</malay> is actually can survive and
(err) like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies [lah] video
I mean (um)
[ah] [ah] if you're comparing <malay>macam</malay> like music [eh] audio and video right
right now video is doing
more important [lah] video is doing well [lah] like ya (um)
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a (err) (uh) to make a content right so
(uh) right now video is important [lah] <malay>macam</malay> there's more video jobs like for internship like more video jobs (err)
are out there [lah] there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
ya [lah] so sometimes I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] I if had taken a video (err) course or what then
would have been different [lah] but but ya [lah] <malay>macam nasib</malay> [ah]

so actually I feel honestly right now <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>macam</malay> want to give up [lah] because
<malay>macam</malay> there's no more industry there's no no more music industry right then
then I'm like in year three trying to finish my diploma in audio then <malay>macam</malay> I feel like sometimes
like want to give up [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> like like
like what am I going to do since next time like if if the if this thing continue then

at at that time <malay>pun</malay>
(err) when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job

<malay>aku aku
it was just a job for me
<malay>dia bukan</malay> [ah]
(uh) it's just a job for me to pay the bills [lah]

I just took took up the job [lah] so (err) when I took up the job I <malay>aku</malay> got a lot of free time and <malay>aku pun</malay> look around <malay>aku tengok kawan-kawan aku aku punya</malay> friends

<malay>nak ambil</malay> degree <malay>apa</malay> then <malay>aku cakap dengan diri aku</malay> okay since <malay>aku</malay> working in this line
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree (uh) which
is related to my work [lah] so (err) maybe (err) (err) few years down the road (err)
I <malay>apa</malay> my boss

down my career path [lah] in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
[oh] okay (err) I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up (uh) civil engineering ya [ah]
(err)
it it it
(err)
it's related [lah] but
(uh) not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the (err) engineering aspect [ah] it's more to the project management side
[ah] so as to be honest <malay>pun apa</malay> my diploma <malay>pun</malay> anytime time <malay>masuk</malay> poly <malay>pun</malay>
it was just like [ah]
I just take up this course [ah] it wasn't (err) (err) it wasn't it wasn't like [oh] <malay>aku</malay> passionate about this course (err) <malay>aku nak nak jadi</malay> engineer no [ah] in it was nothing like that [lah]
ya
so (err) at at that time [ah] after <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>pun</malay> ya you you should you feel lost [lah] <malay>macam apa kau nak buat dengan hidup aku</malay> [eh]

to do what you are you are facing right now [lah]
so <malay>apa ni</malay> at that time <malay>pun macam lepas</malay> <malay>pun abeh macam</malay>
even before during my poly I went for my (err) internship
so it was during my internship that that made me (err) think twice to to join the construction industry
<malay>pasal</malay>
(err) it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
(err) for my internship [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
internship <malay>aku yang</malay> really opened up my eyes <malay>yang</malay> [eh] !siala! <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] industry
[ah]
the working hours the nature of the work (uh) the work environment
(err) (err) ya
(err) <malay>pasal</malay> okay

(err) doubts [lah] <malay>aku pun</malay> like
did I make the right move <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean
<malay>apa</malay> it doesn't really matter also [lah]
ya so
just went along [lah] <malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>aku pun fikir balik</malay> like
(err) ya what he say really (err) <malay>apa</malay> like
(err)
[ah] like
[ah] <malay>tak bedek</malay> [ah] but

because <malay>aku nak nak nak</malay> listen to that guy [kan]
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> (uh)
I mean <malay>apa</malay> you
you just made do with what you have [ah] you just make do with what you have <malay>memang betul</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> the the at that at that time my my nature of work
you need to have some technical knowledge [lah] which I was lacking [ah]
(err) with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking [ah]
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad [ah]
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas [lah]
so
[ah]
[oh] okay
(mm) ya ya
so ya (err)
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
it didn't turn out quite that bad also <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
[ah] consultants usually they provide the technical (err) aspect [ah]
so (err) when when when whenever you
<malay>macam</malay> you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants [ah] so
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
<malay>abeh</malay> (err) from
from <malay>aku punya</malay> nature of work <malay>pun</malay> project management <malay>pun</malay> what what I
what I
what was more on the soft skills
<malay>pasal</malay>
back then <malay>pun aku</malay> wasn't really a
a a <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm
I am a very quiet guy [lah] <malay>aku</malay> not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
but
[ah] when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it [lah]
[ah]
so so ya you <malay>aku aku</malay>
improve on my soft skills and then <malay>dekat</malay> (err) during my course of work <malay>pun</malay> there like what I told you [ah] who decided to further my studies take up
a a
a degree [lah] then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
(err) previously was unisim now they call it [ah]
ya so
then you decided not to
okay [ah]
good for you [lah] good for you I mean
[ah] ya so
I took up
(err) my part-time degree
like I told you before [lah] <malay>apa aku</malay> time <malay>ambil</malay> degree <malay>pun</malay> was like
[oh] everyones
doing a degree I should also do a degree <malay>tapi</malay>
at that time ya like
(uh) <malay>aku</malay> was just following the trend [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> now now <malay>aku fikir balik</malay> I shouldn't have do that [lah] I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
really take up a degree in what really interest you [ah]
and (uh) what you really want to do [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> that time
(mm) (mm)
ya
<malay>apa</malay> (err)
since you say it like that <malay>pada aku</malay> in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in [ah] so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay (um) which I agree [lah] which a degree is not really [ah] <malay>apa</malay> a need [ah]
in the industry because your industry (uh)
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
<malay>tapi untuk aku</malay>
when <malay>aku</malay> did my degree (uh)
(err) <malay>aku</malay> did my degree while while working [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> as years go by [eh]
<malay>aku kat kerja aku</malay> like
<malay>aku tengok aku punya sama</malay> [ah] like
work environment <malay>pun</malay>
(uh) with the the the
bosses like

like [ah] so like
<malay>aku tengok aku punya</malay> bosses [eh] like
<malay>macam</malay> (err)
<malay>dia orang ada takde pun macam beza</malay> [sia]
like they are just like <malay>pasal</malay> okay
(uh) we are a big
organisation [kan] like ya we have a <malay>apa</malay> like (uh)
<malay>tapi</malay> stat board they call it [lah]
and then they got their directors [lah] and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy [ah]
when <malay>kau pun</malay> <malay>pun</malay> you should know [ah] [kan] hierarchy [ah] it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like <malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>kau kat bawah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau nak kena dengar kata dia ni abeh dia ni kadang-kadang tak</malay>

(err) <malay>lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena</malay>
<malay>go through dia kau nak kena go through orang atas dia</malay>
<malay>abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu</malay> decision <malay>orang atas dia lagi</malay>
I mean <malay>kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka</malay>
<malay>orang bawah abeh dia orang bertekak abeh kau kat bawah</malay>
like <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay> like
<malay>kau orang</malay> (err) <malay>kau orang</malay> cannot make a decision <malay>abeh aku nak kena buat apa</malay> [siol]
like sometimes the conflict like
<malay>bertahun-tahun lepas punya</malay> [sia]
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like [eh] !siala! <malay>kau orang dari dulu</malay> [eh] <malay>abeh sampai sekarang</malay>

then (err) <malay>aku pun</malay>
at that time was
was so was want to
transition into the media industry [kan] so <malay>aku</malay> like thought of (err) maybe (err) take a gap year first [ah] before <malay>aku</malay> joined the media industry

(err) so <malay>kalau</malay> teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at #tampines# I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like (err) taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
(um) to a certain extent <malay>pasal [lah] tu</malay> (err) <malay>bila teleportation</malay> okay <malay>kononnya tak ada teleportation</malay> [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>kita dah kena</malay> expose more (err) how should I say it (uh) more unknowingly for example <malay>kita naik</malay> <malay>kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>tak ke lebih bahaya kalau kita tak teleport</malay>
<malay>kalau kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>naik</malay> <malay>atau naik</malay> taxi grab driver <malay>ke</malay> taxi driver <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> expose in that (uh) area <malay>kita duduk kat dalam</malay> <malay>ke</malay> <malay>kat dalam kereta ke</malay>
<malay>kita dengan orang yang suspek tak kita tak tahu ni kita tak tahu dia ada ke tidak ni</malay>
<malay>untuk beberapa minit ini</malay> [ah] <malay>ada yang</malay> research <malay>cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau ada</malay> measure measure <malay>contohnya macam</malay> (uh) sanitisation
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say (uh) for example I I share an example [ah]
let's say <malay>nak pergi</malay> giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food (uh) food court I teleport to the place
then after that (uh) I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay (err) you said it can increase because the person (uh) didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so (err) let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about (err) going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and (uh) maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's (uh) maybe (uh) the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
and I rest at work and exposed again <malay>ini tak boleh kalau kita dah</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kita</malay> skip all the buses <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] all the transportation <malay>ini</malay> exposure
we only expose to the office
[ah] which is easier to contact tourists
[ah] <malay>tak kan begitu</malay>
it is (uh) something
(err)
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
<malay>itu haram tu</malay>
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know (err) be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
(err) I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one (err) mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of (uh) being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe (uh) act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but (err)
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it (uh)
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that (err) you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to (uh) ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that (err) you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means (err) if a person is a father
okay so (err) what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of (uh) two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man (uh) should isolate himself
for months
I feel (uh) I I agree to a certain extent (err) where
let's say this person have (uh) no responsibility maybe (uh) no parents no siblings no children no wives then (uh) I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say (err) okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example (uh) a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
but then when this (err) <malay>banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan</malay> (mm) apa ni orang kata</malay>
<malay>kena pergi kursus</malay> [ah] <malay>kursus-kursus</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer</malay>
<malay>menggunakan aplikasi</malay> word excel <malay>kenapa teknologi telah berubah</malay>
<malay>jadi mereka dah</malay> behind time so <malay>ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin</malay> okay <malay>kut</malay>
okay [lah] [eh] <malay>jap</malay> (err) <malay>kita</malay> (err)
<malay>saya teringat</malay> something [ah] <malay>yang pasal</malay> teleportation [ah] kita (uh) <malay>ni</malay> [eh] reverse <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] [eh] teleportation [eh] <malay>kononnya</malay> teleportation <malay>ni kan boleh kita boleh</malay> teleport
(um) <malay>bila kita umur sepuluh tahun</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira-kira ni macam</malay> so called <malay>macam</malay> time machine <malay>begitu</malay> [ah] (uh) <malay>macam</malay> advance <malay>yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya</malay> invention <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah ada ke tidak ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh</malay> teleport reverse time [eh] maybe <malay>kita</malay> teleport ten years old
<malay>nak cakap apa dengan awak punya</malay> (uh) <malay>diri tu</malay> okay <malay>kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia</malay>
actually (err) pretty similar [ah] on on the investment part because (err) actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves (err) a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
(err)
if you were to tell me that investment is (uh) is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe (err) last time I was maybe too good [ah] I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society (err) when they see [oh] a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much (err) about monetary (err) maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old (err) ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more (uh) gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this (uh) money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go (uh) anywhere that I want because (err) there's a certain level of (err) financial freedom I would say
second topic
[oh] my my memory memory is (err) degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
[oh] I admit (uh) do you have you heard of (uh) about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep (uh) items
or (uh) photos [ah] to then (err) to keep in a secret place or maybe (err) some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video (err) it's like a conversation with (uh) my old my my oldest self so let's say (err) my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually (err) when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so (uh) I just hope I don't lose the video [lah] actually I don't even remember where is it now
(hmm) I like to be famous yes
but
but (uh) I think is (uh) if I were to take myself a picture of myself (err) every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
(err) <malay>salah satu</malay> (err) experience <malay>yang aku pernah mengalami</malay> [ah] <malay>adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> real [ah]
<malay>dia</malay> (err) it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving (uh) at #tioman#
one of the nicer waters in (uh) asia that (uh) that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic (err) trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so (err) I think there is (err) what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of (uh) funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that (err) short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then (uh) another (err) much more serious (err)
(uh) experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me (err) makes me (err)
<malay>bulu roma ternaik</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku</malay>
<malay>jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga</malay> so (err) <malay>saya tengah bawa macam biasa</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba</malay> (err) <malay>saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan</malay> (err) <malay>di</malay> road <malay>tersebut</malay> [lah] <malay>di jalan raya tersebut</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila saya bawa</malay>
then (err) maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was (uh) I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that (err) jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to (uh) go into (uh) into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then (err)
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that (err) it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually (err) and even (err) just now I was riding a bike
(err) due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so (uh) I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
the person a a driver the driver that (uh) was (err) almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily (err) nothing happen <malay>tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja</malay>
<malay>tapi itu pun</malay> okay <malay>itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu adalah</malay> (uh) experience <malay>saya</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> near death experience or rather I would say a near miss [ah] how about you #furqan#
!oho! <malay>dah macam pantun berkerat</malay>
(uh)
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
(err) someone is (err) or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of (err) delivery riders who is (uh) riding very recklessly around (uh) (uh) on the road [ah] because they are
(err) chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe (uh) road (uh) sorry (uh) lorry drivers lorry drivers
<malay>yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen</malay> (uh) <malay>yang tu semua</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>dia orang kerja</malay> trip
<malay>lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut</malay> number of trip <malay>kalau dia orang</malay>
(err) less trip
<malay>kan kurang</malay> [lah] <malay>gaji dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya</malay> (err) <malay>sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak</malay>
(err) <malay>lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dia punya dia punya alasannya</malay> (err)
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because (err) (err) when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example (err) if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can (err) plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering (uh) maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that (err) we are not so (err) I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe (uh) three hobbies one is (err) maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start (err) ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
(err) I would know I'm I'm not really a good (uh) soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because (err) I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that (uh) soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me (err) easily when whenever (err) people especially (uh) in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said [oh] let's play soccer outside
(uh) this way you gain (uh) relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and (err) in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems (err) I think is is is quite interesting
(err)
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some (err) activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure (uh) how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because (err) in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals (err) so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less (err) how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think (uh) as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
(err)
so far I think [eh] all the (err) hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from (err) we are kind of (uh) similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

(uh) <malay>berapa yang</malay>
[orh]
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
[oh]
ya ya ya
[eh] <malay>semalam</malay> you <malay>tengok bola</malay> the #bayern# <malay>dengan</malay> #atletico madrid# game
[oh] why [eh]
how I know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
but the game <malay>gerek</malay> [ah] the game
#bayern# very sick
ya ya okay
ya I know stop back forth back forth [ah]
(hmm) ya each to its own [ah]
<malay>esok buat apa</malay>
[ha] when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
!fuh!
when's the last time when's the last time you went
[ah]
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>kena</malay> book in advance
[oh] so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
(err) they you know <malay>kasi</malay> chance (uh) to (uh) other people [ah]
cause your name <malay>busuk</malay> already haris bin masli banned
and then <malay>esok tak ada apa-apa teman</malay> me [ah] <malay>pergi tengok</malay> (uh) what's this <malay>kerusi</malay>
[eh] <malay>rasa</malay>
can [ah] try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent [ah] and like
they really build up their name [eh] you know like
those DOTA players players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands I would say
pricing <malay>mahal</malay> Secret Lab <malay>paling murah</malay> four nine nine [sia]
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding [eh] I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than [eh] APOL is three nine eight
ya
similar <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> Secret Lab <malay>ada</malay> five years warranty APOL <malay>dua</malay> year [jer]
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya ya
no [ah] it's like covered a few stuff like you know (um) for Secret Lab they have this tear protection thing so where like if the material <malay>kalau terkoyak-koyak</malay> [kan] <malay>kopek-kopek</malay> then after that
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
I
<malay>tapi air tumpah tak</malay> damage <malay>apa</malay> you can just straightaway <malay>lap</malay> the thing then the water is gone already
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is it is
ya
<malay>tu</malay>
ya <malay>aku nampak</malay> I saw that [one] <malay>basuh</malay> the <malay>lantai</malay> then all the stains all just come out right
that's true [ah] Coke like damn sweet [eh] I I'm not a fan of Coke [ah] it's too sweet for me
[ah]
ya standard correct
[ah]
[oh] carton
what that's for <malay>hari raya</malay> [lah]
[ah]

that's non-fizzy
(mm) Seasons the blue colour [one] right
<malay>hijau</malay> [eh]
that's the green tea ice lemon tea [eh] is it
ya that [one] not bad because <malay>dia punya</malay> ice lemon tea flavour in that <malay>tak tak</malay> as strong [ah]
sugar
ya
ya I agree I agree
[eh] wait seasons
[oh] I think I got I think I never try Seasons (uh) peach tea before [eh]
[oh] no I don't think so [eh] the I can't recall
maybe [ah]
[eh] so <malay>bila nak beli ni</malay> table tennis <malay>punya</malay> racket paddle

through you haven't been to club room right ever since
[oh] like as in you just <malay>lepak tak belajar</malay> this kind of stuff
because you got the mindset [lah] like you know there's a
relax corner in school
<malay>potong kaki</malay> [ah]
ya
ya true true
(uh)
I also finding [ah] I want find like (uh) you know like stable kind of part-time
<malay>tapi</malay> cafe
ya exactly cafe <malay>semua gaji</malay> like they don't pay you that well then at most <malay>kurang-kurang</malay>
and nine dollars [ah] if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of (um) eatery
but banquet <malay>malas</malay> [sia] bro banquet <malay>kerja lama kena diri</malay> then like it's not my thing [ah]
<malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay>

ya ya #sheikh# ya okay I tell you about banquet the #sheikh# and this another friend [kan] <malay>dorang kerja</malay> banquet <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] because <malay>dorang dah kerja lama</malay> so they got a lot of seniority
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so this #sheikh# and the my this friend right step manager <malay>dorang tak buat kerja</malay> just like manage them tell them what to do then <malay>lepak</malay> so basically for like let's say maybe ten hours of work right they only do
<malay>dua dua jam tiga jam</malay>
<malay>tapi dapat gaji</malay> for the whole thing then they just <malay>lepak makan</malay>
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already [ah] that's why
[orh]
Shangri-La
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>kahwin</malay> [ah]

[oh]
[orh]
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[oh]

so it's a win win
it's a win win situation [lah]
ya
true
actually that time I I <malay>pernah bilang kau</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kerja ni kat</malay> Marche or something
because
[eh] since when you care [sia] bro

mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
but then he return vouchers so people like think like [eh] <malay>aku bayar macam gini tapi dapat</malay> voucher so like
then okay <malay>juga apa</malay>
ya exactly but then the thing is one thing good they don't have a minimum spending like what my sister do right she everytime <malay>pergi makan dengan</malay> boyfriend right
then they <malay>makan</malay> then talk talk because the boyfriend like
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he he knows the owner
then right everytime go <malay>makan</malay> he'll give like twenty thirty dollar voucher like that so my sister and the boyfriend

you know cakes and (uh) tea or something like that

all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish (uh) cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
!huh!
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
I plan to but then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> need to work [ah] then like don't have much time to play games this [one] now DOTA also I don't really play that much

the new series which is the what's that [ah] Vita
[ah] Vita Vita
Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> necessary [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> touch screen and all
I think
(mm) I think the main appeal is just because can support the
(uh) what's Pokemon games people literally buy just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
<malay>macam</malay> minecraft [ah]
but it looks like minecraft is just I don't feel appealed in playing the minecraft kind of games
ya ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick sick
or is it just to garner the support of like I don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad

and then after that then like
after five years then
(err) you all (err) <malay>rasa macam</malay> you all save enough money to <malay>beli rumah dekat</malay> (err)
then you all just <malay>beli rumah dekat</malay> <malay>abeh</malay> rent out the <malay>rumah dekat</malay> (err) singapore [ah] <malay>dekat</malay> woodlands
like so many like so many people want to rent nowadays

<malay>satu rumah</malay> [eh] seven hundred dollars
<malay>satu bilik</malay> seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
<malay>sebab tempat dia kat</malay> woodlands

then like
no <malay>dekat</malay> singapore [ah] so seven hundred (uh) times four
one thousand four two thousand eight
so one month you earn two thousand eight you never even <malay>kerja</malay>

then <malay>dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada</malay> the <malay>rumah</malay>
then they can just like rent the <malay>rumah</malay> then they can just buy another house because it's like
technically it's like their landed property

<malay>tiga puluh</malay> [ah] <malay>tiga puluh</malay>
<malay>tapi tiga puluh lelaki tak ada masalah</malay> [seh]
<malay>lelaki dengan perempuan masalah</malay>
the harder it is
[ah]
why
(uh huh)
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay
<malay>zuriat zuriat</malay>
[oh] my gosh
ya
pros
(uh) thing to think about
ya
but then okay [ah] I think like the guys prime time is actually thirty years old
thirty years is like a good enough like
(err) time
ya
ya it's it's okay now now younger girls like older guys
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>betul betul betul betul</malay>
!wah!
(uh huh)
[eh] but I think like the trend [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> is like
actually it doesn't matter
cause ya
<malay>tak sebab</malay>
like we all like I think we grew up in a way that
<malay>semua orang boleh jadi</malay> independent like girl <malay>dengan</malay> girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it [ah] and then after that then (err) <malay>kalau macam</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> slack off
then just
ya
so I think the <malay>zaman dah berubah</malay> change already
ya
because right I see I see right actually
now <malay>zaman sekarang orang</malay>
like <malay>perempuan</malay> like like girls
<malay>lagi</malay>
like they earn more
than the guys
ya
and which is like I think like I don't know but like I think it hurts the like
the guy's pride the <malay>maruah</malay> of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's <malay>tak boleh</malay> avoid
<malay>macam</malay>
is it
[ah]
(uh) ya
(mm)
it's not possible [eh]
for <malay>satu</malay> for one person to <malay>kerja</malay>
like to
<malay>macam mana nak cakap macam</malay> sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
you need like to have the both of them to work
<malay>kalau satu orang kerja</malay>
!whoa!
<malay>tapi</malay> commission <malay>pun tak</malay> stable [seh]
<malay>satu hari</malay> like you can like <malay>satu bulan</malay> you can only earn like <malay>macam tiga ribu abeh</malay> the next <malay>bulan</malay> you earn <malay>lima ribu</malay>
<malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>abeh kalau ada bulan satu satu ribu</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
so let's say you need to have like a backup [lah]
saving plan
[kan]
[eh]
[ah] [seh]
<malay>lagi</malay> like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
of like my
[ah]

I was talking to her then on the day <malay>yang</malay> (err)
<malay>kakak</malay> was (err) just <malay>mengumpat pasal dia punya</malay>
(err) <malay>mak mertua</malay> as per usual [lah] the usual (err)
topic of conversation between mummy <malay>kakak</malay> and the #madrina#

ya so then mummy was saying <malay>macam kakak</malay> is
(err) what's the word [ah] (uh)
the what's that <malay>anak mertua yang biadap</malay> I think that was the exact words (err)
or maybe that is a
that is a (mm) adjective to to describe <malay>kakak</malay>
but anyway (err) (um) remember <malay>kakak</malay> I was asking <malay>kakak</malay> when she
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
(err) celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay> in her current house
or celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay> in the next house because
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
[eh] no it should be may it should be may cause this year's <malay>hari raya</malay> was (err) <malay>dua puluh empat</malay>
I remember the <malay>hari raya</malay> was
(err) a few days
after my birthday ya
<malay>dua puluh empat</malay> or <malay>dua puluh enam</malay> I think that was the
that was the official <malay>hari raya punya</malay> date
no [lah] as in just <malay>kakak</malay> was asking me [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay> cause
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like <malay>kasi orang jalan jalan raya</malay> [lah] to her house
like
ya ya ya I I remember is the one <malay>yang abang</malay> #yan# <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>yang abang</malay> #yan# <malay>datang</malay> then he
couldn't freaking leave me alone then like I was trying to shake him off

<malay>kakak kata</malay> okay [lah] obviously but <malay>kakak</malay> was like cause what cause <malay>kakak</malay> couldn't say <malay>macam</malay>
no <malay>tak boleh datang kau tak boleh datang besok</malay> but like <malay>kakak</malay> was like okay
<malay>kenapa ni nak datang</malay> then I remember mum was saying <malay>macam dia tak ada barang tak ada benda lain tak buat apa</malay>
then <malay>macam</malay> why why then mum was telling the story of how he always goes to people's houses
and that stuff
[ah] ya ya I heard that he's doing it and <malay>cik</malay> #anis# is also doing it right was it
how old is <malay>abang</malay> #yan# again
#nazri#
<malay>suka hati</malay> [eh] <malay>abang</malay> just <malay>panggil orang</malay> gay [eh]
I can tell I can tell that you you
!wow! so deep
<malay>sangat</malay> deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from #shura# and all my other female friends as possible
(mm) no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
<malay>macam</malay> best <malay>sangat ke</malay>
<malay>bagus sangat ke</malay> [ah] (ugh) it doesn't happen in
(mm) (mm) maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
there's <malay>macam</malay> everybody is more free and liberal in
is the liberal [one] is the consecutive
for right okay I know that <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak masuk kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dapatkan</malay> the hostel room right
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
[oh] my god reminds me of the remember when (um)
running man was super big and then running man running man
<malay>yang</malay> the korean <malay>punya</malay> show <malay>yang dia orang taruk</malay> the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
<malay>kejar</malay> them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
like other celebrities have to chase them and <malay>cari</malay> I believe they have to pull the name tag off [lah]
so after that (um)
she like it was very popular so I remember me and <malay>kakak</malay> we were saying that
we noticed there was a lot of (err) people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
#jia hui# #jia xing# eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
but last time <malay>dia punya zaman</malay> also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball <malay>dengan</malay> football T-shirt
I remember (um)
last time we used to have this (err) music teacher <malay>kat</malay> bowen [ah] his name was (err) mister #jamal#
so mister #jamal# he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
like professional <malay>macam</malay>
#trumpist# I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter [ah] I have no idea [lah] that trumpet players [ah] like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world [lah] like he told us that
(err) he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because (err) back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown [lah]
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
<malay>kenapa ni</malay>
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that [ah]
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in (err) chicago [lah]
so he would play the trumpet and then his
(um) his
friend would play the piano
so (err) I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior [lah] who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister #jamal# right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this [ah]
<malay>dia punya</malay> club room he
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts [lah]
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
either he's <malay>kekek</malay> like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
(err) the
like the [ah] because he was wearing those
(err)
football jerseys [ah] like those what cowboys [ah] patriots
okay I know that
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers <malay>punya</malay> basketball <malay>punya</malay> like
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of #kasanaz# I'm sure you remember #kasanaz#
so #kasanaz's# husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer [ah] to the point that
they live in singapore but by right #kasanaz# doesn't need to work
ya so <malay>macam</malay> the husband must be really making serious money [ah]
#kasanaz# is like apparently like got money kind of like girl [lah] but I believe the husband is those
<malay>macam</malay>
chief engineer or something [ah] like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time [ah]
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
#kasanaz# knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that #wei xiang# is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like #wei xiang# first of all right
you and me [ah]
[ah] both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university [lah]
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] like
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
and it's not that there's anything wrong with <malay>kerja kerja</malay> [lah] but
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense [lah] since you like you
you're so <malay>macam</malay>
somehow educated [lah] most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties [ah] who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs [ah]
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the (err) the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in [lah]
so ya [lor]
I believe he's just a cashier
(mm)
supply chain <malay>abang</malay> a job that is quite a big need in singapore
you know (err) he used to intern for supply chain for
exactly so <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
(err) so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company [eh] you intern for like a really
big
(err)
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay [lah] no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip [ah]
those <malay>macam</malay> how they rank the
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also [ah]
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example #temasek# right #temasek# holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance (err) teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with #temasek# then we were like bonds [ah]
you know shares right you can buy like hundred [ah]
hundred shares bonds [ah] you have to like buy by the thousands [ah] if I'm not mistaken so <malay>macam</malay> you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
yes so it's really like you need to have money [ah]
ya
but ya [lah] it just doesn't makes sense to me that <malay>dah dah dah belajar susah-susah</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away [lah] but
it's a bit sad [lah] like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan [lah] the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years [ah] I have [one] [lah]
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money [mah] and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents [ah] cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad [lah] quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what [lah] those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever [lah] so I'm just like
why
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that <malay>mamat</malay> the his boyfriend
the I remember it's quite insane [lah] like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue [lah]
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome [ah]
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
(err)
#wei xiang# was quite a
like not say an advocate [lah] he was quite a
he was quite against <malay>macam</malay> he liked to look down on a lot of this <malay>macam</malay> people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this <malay>macam</malay>
the <malay>halal</malay> version of jack's restaurant [lah] there was one at
this at this
it's the steak [one] I remember the there's a <malay>halal</malay> [one] made by this chef then he had a
restaurant at this then #wei xiang# didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists (uh) near the library
yes
I believe it is or it's just (err) something like jack's but it's <malay>halal</malay>
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat [meh] with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no [lah] so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was (uh) didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the (uh) boyfriend was studying [ah] architecture or something [ah]
and then the boyfriend he's (err)
he's got money [lah] he's rich I forgot what the father does [ah]
(err) the father quite strict with the money [ah]
like I remember the father once said that
(err) got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten [lah] then the father got so pissed the father said
(err)
since you on the aircon after ten right (err) [ah] your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
(um) divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
then the mother is back there then he is here [lah] then the father remarried then I think like the father <malay>macam</malay>
I think the father
<malay>dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit [lah] like the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings [ah]
I don't know
I don't know [lah]
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so !wah! talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go #jakarta# one
second thing right they always go #jakarta# on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
#jakarta# right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
#dubai# or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
like <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense [lah] and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from #wei xiang# #wei xiang# told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
(mm) go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money #wei xiang# give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them [ah] but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can [lah] one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no [lah] you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be #dee kosh#
don't prey on kids
seriously #dee kosh# is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
(err) okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
lemon yogurt you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak ingat</malay> [eh]
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew [lah] his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me [eh] #raf# want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called [lah] then he was like [oh] my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking #dee kosh# then I'm like !huh! what you #dee kosh# wants you to model for him [ah] he's like no #dee kosh# wants to suck my then I'm like
[eh] wait wait wait wait wait [eh] you don't anyhow [hor]
then he show me the like the text [lah] so I was like
you're this guy is insane [eh] you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
you don't <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam bodoh</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> don't don't <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> your own freaking like
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am #dee kosh# your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like [oh] you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that (um)
like then later on he'll be like [oh] like (err)
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars [lah]
so so <malay>macam</malay> I was telling like him [ah] that
no obviously I don't know #dee kosh# I'm telling my friend that
no so (um) I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal [lah] hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid [lah] there are apps and all these [mah]
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these [lah] cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people [mah] like
no one agreed to this [ah] and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this [ah] so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they they don't want to <malay>macam</malay> speak out against like gay people because like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
like people don't want to <malay>macam</malay> [oh] actually she's a liar and all these ya
it's the same as (uh) you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
[a'ah] the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
a lot [lah] I tell you right all these <malay>macam</malay> people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like #dee kosh# is quite stupid [lah] in my mind <malay>macam</malay>
you're famous <malay>kau</malay> famous <malay>macam</malay> like people know people people know your face then
<malay>kau buat macam gini macam</malay> you want to proposition right don't use your own account [lah]
<malay>pakai macam pakai</malay> fake account [lah] <malay>gini pakai</malay> your own account <malay>macam</malay> you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for <malay>macam</malay> like someone is
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said [ah] is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal [lah] you can't like solicit sex for cash [lah] I believe
that is
wrong [lah] like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong [lah] I don't know how how wrong it is [lah] in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due (err) not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not [lah]
because <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know right is not a good enough (um)
answer to to evict you from like (err)
like
a a sentence [ah] it's like that there was this guy who
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to <malay>macam</malay>
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone (err) he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
(err) with drugs [ah] that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge [lah] he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious [meh] for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough <malay>macam</malay>
it's (err) it's not a good enough (err) like what you call it
defence [ah] the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
so same for #dee kosh# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> just because you you
he the guy never say or whatever right [ah]
doesn't like make it right [lah] you should own self <malay>macam</malay>
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
(err) lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine [lah] like the person cannot say because the person lied [mah]
and the person tricked you into it but #dee kosh# I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that [oh] I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only [mah]
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly [lah] but like people like
influence [ah]
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific [lah] social media influences [ah]
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle [lah]
that's between the followers and them [ah] some people will like [ah] it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and [ah] you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense [ah] like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this [lah] but we don't empower him to do the things he do [mah]
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram [ah] Instagram empowers him [lah] Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things [ah]
nicole #choo#
first of all right there is no <malay>budak zaman sekarang</malay> you and me right are difference by five years only
yes
okay first of all right it's not <malay>budak-budak zaman sekarang</malay> there are people your age right
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is [ah] the world evolves in this way [lah] so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition [lah] everything like happens because something happens [mah]
so like it's just evolution [lah] like something !ee! the previous generation must have done right has created this [lah]
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it [lah] I feel like I created monsters
which is true [lah] I remember she was the first
real socialite [lah] because before kardashian there was her [what]
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich [eh] like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite [ah] she's like those
rothschild
like what
what rothschild what those other like (err) rockefeller and those <malay>macam</malay>
legendary families [ah] like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
(um)
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder <malay>punya</malay> line the lauder family
(uh) can't really think of any other people like right now [lah] but
and all of course all your shakes [ah]
all your shakes <malay>macam</malay>
how do I put it [lah] like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it [lah] it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes [ah] to tell people like what they're doing is wrong [lah] if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it [lah] like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
so ya so <malay>macam</malay>
it's just the content

it was initially ya it stopped I could have done it I could have done it [lah] but then because tonight my wife works night shift so she's gonna go to work at roughly
seven thirty so <malay>kira</malay> since I'm not going to see her tonight you see so just make it one day and then we just spend the whole day together
did my bookings for my staycation pan pac because my friend <malay>dia</malay> celebrating
no because my friend did (err) is doing [ah] his daughter's birthday party <malay>kat situ</malay> like the same one I did for my son ya so like [eh] like he's some relative also like staying over [lah] they actually asked us to I think just they book <malay>dua bilik</malay> back to back because the the room can actually you know you book it together
the rooms actually always separate there's outside door <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>boleh tutup</malay> then you can remove the <malay>bilik macam besar</malay> so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no [lah] then ask us to stay over for <malay>dua malam mesti dia ada</malay> ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in [ah] I've been there before no no the pools were but <malay>dia</malay> limited so you need to book when you're there [lah] so basically [ah] I want to go to the pool do you have any like
no they got time limit so when you book your time right it's one hour when you book then you don't want to go always right waste time but I didn't but that time when I went was okay [lah] but it's a it's a service free
so <malay>ada</malay> kitchenette <malay>ada apa</malay> no no I don't know that's my friend
one room I mean I just bring my wife so we can still hang out with my friend [ah] !yay! do the what first ya
no no no no I still need to send it to let them go and
endorse then present it on saturday <malay>tu</malay> saturday ya cause saturday we got video shoot with #suhaimi yusof#
so like most of us will be there [lah] I think it's #suraya#
could be five I'm not too sure depends on what language they speak on that day I mean I actually grew up with it what my mum
(err) there's a lot of groups [lah] yeah #sheik alauddin# group he sea games ya I mean he's like the he was like he's like the same like #fandi ahmad# he was the first <malay>melayu</malay> who got the spot [ah] so called went on international platform
and stuff but when it comes to #sheik# questionable [ah] there are but not a lot there's not a lot <malay>ajak-ajak ayam</malay> but now my
my guy I got one I think I I got one [ah]
british guy
<malay>bertanding</malay>
he's from fulham fulham
salad singapore I want to do the salad
no [oh] my god he is he is kind of two left feet actually ya but that's the thing I feel like he's like he he okay like two left feet but then I think he plays soccer actually he he plays soccer so [ah] the thing is that they said he started coming like more often ever since circuit breaker I think like his normal amateur soccer games or whatever is like so common nowadays so that's why he every saturday will be there for training
so that's what I'm like telling my guy he said okay
[ah] supposedly there is [lah] but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad [lah] ya
what
!huh!
!hais! can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here
then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like copy paste copy paste <malay>apasal ni tak</malay> copy paste to me it's [oh] ya ya you use Macbook that's why I think I did use Mac computer before last time when I was working for this one company
then
so that's where I learn photoshop [lah] but then like forget how to do photoshop
I used to do photography in schools
ya you will but I think like it's like so far it was like primary school ya forget it anyway I stop doing it when my friend passed away because we used to be partners together then he passed away in secondary school
<malay>lepas tu tak buat lagi</malay>
ya something like no <malay>dia punya urat hati dia putus</malay>
<malay>sedih</malay> [kan]
it's only like what time <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dua belas</malay> [eh] <malay>tiga belas</malay>
and then after that because I I know the whole I know the whole family [lah] yeah because after that I I found out from my mum that actually
his parents used to stay two [ah] levels up from my <malay>rumah lama</malay> in west coast
so in a way I think we we were like we were so called growing up playing together when younger after that we went our own ways then <malay>dah tak</malay> apparently we meet back in the same school so that's why I know the whole family so the brother passed away one year after
yup I forgot why the brother passed away but it's really sad [ah] then I only found out cause after he passed away then he contact no [lah]
only one only one one one of my girlfriends
yeah she was a good friend [lah] we've been friends now I think twenty odd years twenty one years
but now we we talk to each other lesser
I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy [tau] <malay>orang yang macam</malay> they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
[ah] I didn't really have a good reputation in school
yeah it doesn't really matter to me [lah]
I don't I don't I don't really care what people think about me
ya in a way I mean in a way like if you want to talk bad about me so be it [lah] I won't I won't lose sleep over it
<malay>suka hati kau kau dah besar</malay>
ya
even my friends also okay [lah] last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>jumpa gitu</malay> [jer] [lah] like you know

so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
so did you sign up for the starhub plus <malay>ada macam</malay> free so you can watch on your phone
but that [one] starhub [what] I don't know
[oh]
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to [lah] have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy [lah] you have to but this [one] because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
then <malay>susah nak</malay> just imagine like chinese I don't know which part of chinese
very actually laggy [lah] the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this [one] but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software (err) no it's in english
depends [lah] that time I bought it for for my in laws then like <malay>macam tak payah nak bayar</malay> Astro but then (err) they didn't turn on the Astro [lah] of course it was still on contract so I just bought so they can watch other stuff my father in law signed up for
but then after awhile they got home key so like nevermind [lah] then like so difficult for them <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>bayar</malay> Astro <malay>bayar</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>takpe</malay>
of course of course it is still on I mean cable cable in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch per say when is the last time you watch
or cinemax or
that's why my mother in law also watching <malay>dengan ibu</malay> I mean #Suria#
[eh] were you the one who send the message about the [oh] ya no about what <malay>yang</malay> the troops [kan] after the cruise ship [oh] no no what actually what is it about this <malay>tulisan jawi jawi</malay> is not arab <malay>tulisan jawi jawi</malay> is translated to malay ya in another words but I think
okay [lah]

<malay>buta cikgu mati</malay> [seh]
and that ya but the chinese people can can function with their language (uh)
but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
<malay>tak pandai berbual</malay> english at the later age in their life <malay>tapi orang melayu makcik-makcik</malay> still can talk english <malay>lebih kurang</malay> because I think I think it's because <malay>dorang ada apa tu</malay>
it's in
latin form [ah] so
<malay>dorang belajar</malay> latin form alphabets and everything
which one
[oh] ya
they are malaysians !huh! [oh] then and surprisingly because I was attending to the one lady <malay>kat depan tu</malay> no cause october <malay>banyak</malay> because okay actually they have consistent salary loss
[ah] no because in october
<malay>ada orang</malay>
so because the people the colleagues so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so
!siala! no I just I just told her you try december [lah] no she stuck in october so so it's like so now if you want september october november october is the one that stuck so okay [lah] november december
[oh] <malay>nasib</malay> [ah]
I don't know [lah] but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply [lah] said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't [lah] cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see
ya I think they will I don't think they will just I think they will give a buffer cause previously come on [lah] even with our colleagues also some of them also !huh! what's that it's been how many months been around what still don't know what's going on
should I straighten my hair I think I want to try trim trim my hair again just for the fun of it [lah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh]

<malay>dorang takleh</malay> accept <malay>orang</malay> outspoken <malay>macam orang</malay> he only talking his own opinion in what appears on his mind [what] <malay>tapi orang tak boleh</malay> accept
(mm)

<malay>orang yang macam terlalu</malay> clean [kan] <malay>aku</malay> always very despise <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bukan aku</malay> jealous [tau] like how are you really sure <malay>kau macam gini punya bersih</malay> like
(mm)
(mm)
ya
true true true
[oh]
<malay>cam</malay> they feel their feelings express it that's all
thirty three
<malay>lagi</malay> twenty seven minutes
[orh]
it's a cold world
all the lie <malay>tak</malay> [ah]
<malay>asal</malay> [eh]
<malay>tak tahu apa dia nak</malay> [ah]
means
[orh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[sial] [lah]
[a'ah]
<malay>cerita apa cerita apa</malay>
[orh]
normal [ah]
so at the end of the day pun different <malay>orang tengok lain</malay> [pe]
so <malay>macam</malay> upon <malay>macam</malay> texts <malay>pun sama</malay>
<malay>macam kalau aku cakap</malay> [sial] [lah] <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau kau baca</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni maki aku</malay> [pe] [sial]
<malay>tapi kalau aku aku cakap</malay> in a very playful way
it's just perspective [ah] you know
<malay>kalau kau tengok macam kau punya</malay> thoughts <malay>macam gitu</malay> then <malay>kau fikir cara gitu</malay> then
how can can you blame me [sia] <malay>aku</malay> say in a very cannot blame me [ah]
[orh]
[orh]
(mm)
non-stop [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] <malay>dorang ada</malay> record <malay>macam</malay> some <malay>dorangnya</malay>
talk [ah] <malay>sedih</malay> [sia]
<malay>pasal kau boleh dengar dari suara dia</malay> [sia] <malay>kau yang</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku tak tumbuk kau</malay> [sia] I mean like <malay>kau tumbuk aku</malay>
<malay>kau tak cakap abeh</malay> amber <malay>macam aku pukul kau</malay> [jer] [pe]
<malay>kau</malay>
[ah]
<malay>abeh kau campak</malay>
pots and pans <malay>kau campak</malay> vase
like <malay>tak salah ke tu salah</malay> [seh] <malay>kau tahu</malay>
<malay>macam aku ada</malay> listen to few tips <malay>orang kahwin</malay> [ah] <malay>orang dah kahwin cakap</malay>
sometimes the person that you marry is not the same person that you get in the relationship with
then that's why it makes sense <malay>bila dia cakap</malay>
<malay>kan selalu cakap</malay> stephen [kan]
<malay>buat apa kau nak</malay> relationship <malay>lama-lama</malay>
in the end <malay>asal kau nak</malay> a meet up marriage before you get married you know you are creating another problem for yourself
<malay>kadang-kadang fikir balik macam sedih</malay> [sia] <malay>kalau</malay> yet to find out
<malay>macam apa ni</malay> the person that <malay>kau sukakan</malay> and then <malay>bila korang kahwin</malay> is just a different person
but
<malay>abeh korang</malay> stuck [tau] you are stuck there don't know like <malay>kalau aku tinggal</malay>
<malay>ni</malay> thing <malay>aku salah bila aku</malay> let it be it's gonna be a problem for me so how do I even solve this [sia]
like there's
like I really <malay>dia</malay> just stuck [sia]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[oh]
correct
strangers [ah] at the end of the day
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
that's why <malay>aku</malay> always believe this phrase <malay>macam</malay> doesn't mean we can vibe we are compatible
like <malay>tak semestinya kita boleh</malay> vibe <malay>macam</malay> [eh] but we are compatible for each other it doesn't mean that vibe and compatibility is two different thing
like <malay>aku boleh kita</malay> like <malay>boleh macam</malay>
[ah] people always said like !wah! if I can vibe with you okay okay but [sial] [lah] that is just a touch <malay>atau</malay> it's a two different things [seh]
whether you're not <malay>kau boleh tinggal serumah dengan dia</malay> and like accept who she is that's a different thing [sia]
so <malay>untuk aku macam orang selalu macam cakap aku boleh</malay> vibe <malay>dengan kau</malay> it's a
it's not good it's a very
biased one-sided [ah]
it's not <malay>macam</malay> it's not cause you can't true
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
is it cause of the
<malay>dia nya</malay> expectations or
(mm)
that's why <malay>aku takut aku tak</malay> understand about <malay>aku nya</malay> self especially
like sometimes <malay>aku suka orang ni</malay> then <malay>aku akan</malay> go for her
but [kan] <malay>bila dah</malay> at the stage <malay>macam boleh aku</malay> just <malay>cabut diri</malay>
<malay>untuk aku</malay> is like <malay>tak</malay> one thing is commitment [ah] <malay>macam</malay> the commitment of having someone to <malay>jaga</malay> is <malay>untuk aku</malay> really <malay>takut untuk aku</malay>
ya <malay>aku nya</malay> reason why <malay>aku aku</malay> understand this part of me [eh] <malay>aku cakap</malay> reason why <malay>aku takde mata air bukan aku cakap aku takleh dapat aku boleh</malay> but it's just that
<malay>dah</malay> a few times <malay>aku</malay> try and then <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>cabut</malay>
like <malay>aku</malay> just fuck up like I always find the reason to fuck this up [ah] like
just ghost her <malay>atau</malay>
ya so like sometimes <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>macam bingit</malay> [ah] <malay>macam takde</malay> then you know like I want something but <malay>bila dah ada nanti aku</malay> just <malay>cabut</malay>
so I always remind myself <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau aku suka orang aku cakap kalau dia betul-betul</malay> then go for it [ah] if not then for what you waste your time
like in the end of the day <malay>kau akan cabut juga</malay> [pe] at the end of the day <malay>kalau kau tak suka dia</malay>
so ya
that's why that time <malay>kawan kau tanya aku aku terus teringat</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>kawan kau yang yang kerja</malay> nurse [eh] part-time
<malay>siapa</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tanya takde mata air macam tak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam asal entah</malay> [eh] <malay>terus aku terus cam teringat</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> like
<malay>aku kalau ada ada</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's just that at the end of the day <malay>aku cabut</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[eh]
ya <malay>pasal</malay>
(mm)
<malay>untuk aku pun itu</malay> is a different way of (err) <malay>camne nak cakap</malay> [eh]
it's a different way of <malay>macam kita</malay> own body <malay>ada</malay> own mechanics [ah]
the reason why <malay>macam aku dengan kau</malay> is always <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>diam dulu</malay> then <malay>nanti baru gerek</malay> is cause technically we are trying to protect ourselves
like <malay>dia ni boleh ngam ke tak tak</malay> [leh] <malay>ngam</malay> then why not why for what <malay>aku</malay> waste <malay>akunya</malay> time
<malay>kalau dia punya dia punya</malay> mindset is <malay>macam</malay> I got nothing to lose the world is mine
then like just live life to the fullest [lah] that kind of mindset [ah] but for us yes we have that mindset but it's just that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam apa ni</malay> you don't need it unless we really need it come ya
ya how to say
to throw away [ah] to waste [ah] ya
is this a is this a Twitter specifically for
romanticism <malay>atau</malay> all the stuff
[orh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>ya</malay> [lah] I understand
to be cause at the end of the day right
one thing <malay>dorang</malay> been <malay>berbual pasal</malay> gender role <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang sendiri</malay> confused with their own gender role this kind of thing <malay>untuk aku lelaki</malay> shouldn't be the one doing it the most of the time it's it's a feminist trait [lah] I would say
so <malay>macam</malay> all these <malay>macam</malay> sweet stuff
is it it has to be balanced [what] yin and yang
so the guy basically provides and
all the <malay>macam</malay> masculine stuff the girl of course have to be <malay>kalau dua-dua</malay> side <malay>macam</malay> family then how how do we even counter this
there's no balance [ah] then after that's when <malay>nanti dorang dah</malay> complain [oh] <malay>dia ni</malay> annoying [ah] <malay>gini gini gini</malay>
cause they already have too much
like you eat too much sweets <malay>sakit tekak</malay> [pe]
<malay>apa</malay>
based of perspective [one] [ah]
<malay>kalau kau suka laki tu apa-apa dia buat pun</malay> sweet [pe]
<malay>dia tak buat apa-apa pun</malay> sweet <malay>abeh kalau laki tu macam</malay> he's not your type
<malay>asal pula aku kena panggil</malay> creep
<malay>ya</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
that's <malay>untuk aku</malay> there's no such thing [ah]
cause the scariest part [kan] <malay>macam macam mana kau dah kahwin dengan</malay> this someone [kan]
how sure are you that this twenty four hour <malay>otak dia</malay> is <malay>bedek bedek</malay>
<malay>bila kita tengah main</malay> [kan] <malay>aku boleh</malay> imagine someone else <malay>asal kau tak boleh</malay> imagine someone else confirm <malay>kau boleh</malay> imagine someone else [pe] but at the end of the day you have to give and take let her be and let her think let us think
toxic
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that that's why the misconcept of <malay>macam</malay>
there's no connection
cause of that feeling
like [oh] <malay>takde</malay> connect then they <malay>cakap</malay> to make it in a very layman <malay>dengan</malay> very
to see that they are smart <malay>atau</malay> they can feel all these [oh] <malay>takde</malay> connection [ah]
there's no connection between us just cause they don't
feel orgasm [ah] scientifically [lah] like you know
(mm)
(mmhmm)

[ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
as in ya [lah]
<malay>kalau kau hidup aku nak</malay> obviously like
every everything I mean like if a life has a purpose what and <malay>kalau</malay> if <malay>semua benda yang kau nak</malay> then what's the point of living right like (uh) might but basically you were just saying like

so
ya that's that's that's what's up
but ya in terms
in terms of my life
it's been hard [lah] it's hard it's been hard to tolerate life [ah] as it is [ah] obviously [ah] I mean like (uh) saying it for everyone ya <malay>tapi rabak</malay> opinion <malay>kau kau cakap</malay>
<malay>semua benda kau nak dapat takmo rabak</malay> [ah]
like
okay (um)
<malay>tapi untuk kau kalau macam</malay> about like relationship with a girl
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> like
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> (uh)
what <malay>apa kau cari dalam</malay>
(uh) in a girl for you to you know
basically (uh)
<malay>perempuan idaman kau</malay> [ah]
ya so <malay>apa apa perempuan idaman kau</malay> like
<malay>untuk aku</malay> I think like
that's (uh) in general <malay>tu apa semua laki pun nak</malay> [lah]
but like (uh) <malay>kau</malay> try think think harder think deeper like feel like deeper like <malay>apa kau nak apa kau sebenarnya nak</malay>
(uh) <malay>dalam wanita</malay> like because let's be honest [ah] like
in life you weren't like <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat perempuan yang sempurna</malay> like <malay>tak ada orang sempurna</malay> [pe] <malay>dalam hidup ni</malay>
so <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat orang yang sempurna</malay> so like just think deep like <malay>kau rasa apa yang</malay> those some qualities that
like we know you can find but
like obviously the perfect qualities like
what you're you're saying is isn't isn't going to be like totally achievable [lah] like I don't think everyone would
[eh] [ah] like a lot of you can easily find
someone like that [ah] so like
think deeper [ah] just like what's like let's say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>cam aku</malay> okay let <malay>berbual pasal aku</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk aku kalau aku perempuan yang aku nak</malay> is
someone <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak pandang aku macam</malay>
<malay>dia tengok aku macam lebih daripada lebih daripada orang lain</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>aku nak rasa</malay> like I'm like I'm just someone who whose the only one in the world [ah] like you know
you know <malay>kau faham apa aku cakap</malay> like
<malay>lawa ni semua siapa tak nak siapa tak nak lawanya orang siapa pun tak nak orang yang</malay> handsome <malay>semua orang pun nak</malay> but ya or [ah] and one more thing <malay>yang</malay> can
catch my eye is (err) is the girl funny [ah] to me if they're funny
to me if they're funny
it you know it keeps me alive [ah] it keeps me laughing I like to laugh you know [ah] <malay>apa ni ketawa semua orang suka ketawa</malay> [pe]
I mean like (uh)
ya so <malay>untuk aku perempuan kalau boleh buat aku ketawa</malay> that's already
(err) you know <malay>kalau</malay> (uh) in english <malay>dia</malay> called it like what red flag for one side of the team if
if I would say myself this is called green flag [ah] for like if they can make me laugh
if you get what I mean [ah] <malay>kalau faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kau faham tak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay>
ya like <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau boleh buat ketawa</malay> it's already something [ah] it's like a lot [ah] for me
because to me [lah] <malay>perempuan tak perempuan perempuan tak kelakar sangat [ah]</malay> like like maybe
like a lot of the girls [lah]
maybe I I think it's biased a bit
it's quite biased because a lot of the girls
<malay>yang aku jumpa dorang tak kelakar dorang macam</malay> lame [ah] but I mean I find it cute as well but
you know
and ya I've only met like what
maybe one or two girls <malay>yang</malay> I find (uh) very entertaining and <malay>kelakar</malay> [ah]
so ya like and another quality is I would say that's achievable
(um)
<malay>dia tak payah</malay> like <malay>faham aku dia tak payah aku</malay> [ah] <malay>sepenuhnya</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> just expect <malay>aku</malay> just expect <malay>dia</malay> to be there for me get me
(uh) so like okay so let me ask you [ah] <malay>sekali lagi sekali aku tanya kau</malay>

<malay>aku cam aku cam</malay> in denial
and when I was in denial I was like
still (uh)
I wouldn't say want to force [ah] it was just like
maybe in that in a sense I guilt trip her not really guilt trip her [lah] but maybe maybe it was [ah]
I don't know [ah] for someone else to judge for you to judge or [what] [ah] like <malay>aku cakap dengan dia cam</malay> like

<malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>cuba</malay> [ah] <malay>semua benda</malay> [sia] <malay>aku cuba</malay> in that in the first one but
slowly I realised <malay>cam aku tak boleh buat pape</malay> [ah] and at one point [ah] I think I was just pestering her too much that I wasn't even pestering [ah] because actually <malay>tu</malay>
(err) <malay>hari jadi dia</malay>
and then [dah] <malay>gitu aku</malay> wish [ah]

<malay>benda-benda sedih</malay> so <malay>aku cam</malay> (uh) out of the blue <malay>aku cam</malay>
<malay>aku tak nak aku nak</malay>
<malay>kesah aku tak nak tanya</malay> [ah] <malay>apa khabar</malay> like what's wrong you know <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> (uh)
<malay>kongsi pape benda</malay> then <malay>kau kongsi</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> don't mind like <malay>dengar</malay> hear it out
<malay>apa-apa dia dia ada ada dia perlu cakap</malay> [kan]
so <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku tanya dia</malay> [ah] like (uh)
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days [ah] some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone [ah] I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
[ah]
something like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>terus cam</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay>
so <malay>kita berbual berbual</malay> [lah] and then I got interested you know
[oh] [ah]
so <malay>untuk kau</malay> to be honest <malay>aku tak tahu tu</malay> too early <malay>ke tak tapi untuk kau</malay>
(uh) do you think what's what's the time limit <malay>untuk kau untuk kau</malay> move on like when do you think is the right time to move on and like
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
okay when <malay>aku aku</malay> just started out with the girl
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now (err)
I was
still in process [ah] honestly I was still in process [ah] low-key I was still in process
but
(err)
somehow I I
I move on [ah] I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is [ah] and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
(err) I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
<malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> [kan] <malay>pasal aku</malay> feel like it's a crime
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
[ah] I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
what is she up to is she okay is she fine <malay>ke</malay>
(um)
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay [ah] maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening [ah]
but it feels it feels like a crime [ah] sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having [ah] because I really love what we are having already [ah] so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good [ah]
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
<malay>cam</malay> how how it could have been a lot [ah] so I don't know if
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask [lah] like
what what what went wrong
[ah]
okay so it's like
actually <malay>betul</malay> actually <malay>betul</malay> ya ya ya ya <malay>aku faham aku faham</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> continue
<malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] ya ya ya you could say that [ah] but
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride [ah] I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous [ah]
my previous
girl [lah] and
to me it's fine I guess you know (uh) as you said also I think it's fine [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
to care you don't uncare for somebody <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> [pe]
so and it's okay [ah]
(um)
(mm)
but I'm still young [ah] and I I'm still very young so <malay>cam aku tak</malay>
<malay>aku tak fikir-fikir sangat macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku akan kahwin</malay> this third girl <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>tak nak fikir sangat</malay> [ah] so [dah] <malay>tiga perempuan</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku nak kena aku nak kena layan ni semua benda</malay> [kan]
so <malay>cam</malay> from my experience I'm just going out with the flow
but
doing my best as well [ah] so if it goes to where
to where I want it to be to where we both want it to be then (uh) <malay>alhamdulillah</malay>
but if not
<malay>takpe</malay> [ah]
but <malay>untuk kau</malay> in general your <malay>kau punya</malay> love life [kan]
like
(uh)
<malay>kalau kau</malay> explain in general <malay>kau punya</malay> love life how has it been like
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
<malay>faham faham</malay>
okay okay
<malay>aku bilang aku punya juga</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk aku apa salah</malay>
<malay>apa salah apa macam benda yang aku boleh perbaiki</malay> from like past relationships
first thing
<malay>pertamanya</malay> is
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is (uh)
you know I learnt how to accept
(err)
third thing thing is (uh) I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time [ah]
<malay>hidup dengan apa yang</malay> [dah] <malay>ada kat situ</malay> [ah]
so just live [ah] you know <malay>takmo</malay>
<malay>takmo fikir banyak sangat</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal apa akan jadi</malay> in the future
<malay>kau tahu cam</malay> just live [ah] live your life
ya <malay>gitu</malay>
(um)
true ya what you said is true [ah] and
ya and then you know those are the three lessons [ah]

gatherings (mm) large large gathering correct is very hard already hopefully next year good news with the vaccine and all that but (uh) not putting any hopes of next year [lah]
correct correct ya (mm) (mm) (mm) ya
it it was funny because before that before I I I'm in this (uh) industry for about three three plus years
so before that I was actually working for ministry of finance as an accountant for seven years ya (uh) (uh)
I was good at it (uh) it was actually I think my second job ya second full time job [ah] before that I was (uh) with Starhub for about one year plus
[ah] then I got my certification and all that then I went to ministry of finance
so (uh) I was good at it (uh) being an accountant but I hated that job <malay> tak suka sangat
(err) ya I mean I was pretty good at it [ah] I wouldn't say I'm like one the at it I'm pretty good at it I survived there for seven seven years but after around five years
(err) I had a [dah] [dah] boring [dah] so sick and tired of the job so I ask for a for to resign but then my boss <malay> cakap [ah] no no cannot I'm I'm not
letting you resign you stay for one more year okay then I stay for one year so six years already at the end of the six years the the yearly review you know the one to one talk with the bosses then I said okay I'm gonna to resign already no no no you stay for one more year okay [dah] stay I there they manage to stop me
so after seven years when I went into the living room I went in I sit down with my manager and my director before I sat down I told them okay both of you be quiet I'm going to talk
I told them I'm going to resign and there's nothing both of you can say that I that will make me stay okay so that's that I don't want to hear my grade I don't want to hear how much bonus you wanna give me I want to resign
[ah]
(mm)
ya it ya that's a good thing about government job is literally what they call iron rice bowl so I'm very I'm pretty sure that even during now this COVID time I will still be getting my pay eventhough work from home and all that I will not ever be getting retrenched from a government job

<malay>abeh kawan aku tu gi</malay> #geylang# <malay>dengan dia cakap macam</malay>
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed [ah]
rightfully so [ah] to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
not really doesn't have a place <malay>macam</malay> I dare not kind of thing <malay>macam kau</malay> [lah] basically
you have a place to go but you rather not [ah]
that kind of situation [ah]
ya basically [lah] same thing [ah]
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it [ah]
but
now seeing this
<malay>aku</malay> didn't really bitch at him about it [lah] <malay>aku tak macam bising ke apa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak</malay>
you know
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront <malay>aku</malay> I I said
I'm not angry at you <malay>aku</malay> more concerned rather than angry [lah] cause I was not in the receiving end of this [ah] so it's fine [lah]
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend [ah] rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
cause that time <malay>pun</malay> the previous issue <malay>pun</malay> he didn't tell me then I found out <malay>aku pun</malay> pissed [ah] I told you already not to do that anymore
I have
I have
[eh]
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know [oh] but
you know people are driven by greed [what] some people do not know how to control their greed
<malay>macam</malay> it's addictive [what]
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you [what]
(um)
ya he left
(uh) some cash cause I don't know [ah] he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
yes of course it got stolen <malay>abeh lepastu</malay> he was really bummed out about it
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
alright
<malay>aku</malay>
am thinking [lah] what to do now <malay>abeh ada</malay> other [ah] <malay>ada</malay> issues as well
no he borrowed me money <malay>abeh lepastu aku</malay> trying to recoup back the amount that he took
<malay>bab tu</malay> [lah] he's going to pay back I hope [lah] eventually
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap [ah]
okay
so
(mm)
sort of
#fahim# no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know [lah] whether
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us <malay>ke</malay>
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl [lah]
I mean technically there is a plague going on [ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(hmm)
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably [lah] [eh]
(mm)
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does [tau] maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
[ah]
from what <malay>aku</malay> understand [ah] my wife said the same thing you get me
ya ya like it it's inside [lah] and so it's called what you said is right correct [pe]
ya
why you were there [lah] at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
#farid# <malay>cakap</malay> he would just <malay>salam</malay> me and just <malay>cam balik</malay>
I mean okay [lah] it's true [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
be a part of it [lah] cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
[ah] <malay>aku aku</malay> do feel that every time <malay>aku</malay> hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress [ah] now they divorced [kan]
<malay>aku</malay> every time
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> do feel
(um)
in a moral dilemma every time
that
what I shouldn't be there okay [lah] #kim# said it perfectly [ah] <malay>cakap</malay>
you know I don't feel good that she's there
I don't want to validate this relationship <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want to say <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you cannot hang out with us [ah]
it doesn't feel right [what]
<malay>macam</malay> I want to hang out with him
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that [oh] I'm approving this [ah] it feels wrong [ah]
so it puts us in a tough spot [ah]
back then [ah]
but then eventually what I did was <malay>aku</malay> just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical #farid# [lah]
like shadow boy shadow boy
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] good names
I think eight years
twenty twelve I think [ah] <malay>aku</malay> don't really remember exactly
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>anal</malay> [lah] then okay anyways stress [ah] <malay>aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas</malay> think
okay
(mm)
<malay>nanti kalau rosak macam mana</malay>
what the
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>cakap</malay> please <malay>boleh</malay> #astagfirullahaladzim#
okay
(hmm)
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> just the
okay let's say it was just <malay>aku</malay> #fahim# and
#loco# [ah]
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] good names okay whatever [lah] <malay>bukannya</malay> [ah] okay anyway <malay>aku</malay> #fahim# and mistress <malay>lepak</malay> just the three of us the whole time
I wouldn't
<malay>tapi</malay> this [one] whole group
know [what]
she's gonna be there
<malay>tak</malay> usually we will know though
it came to a point where if #riz# there she's there
so we knew what to expect [ah]
I mean initially my wife was worried [lah] <malay>dia cakap</malay>
what if you get tempted to you know <malay>macam</malay> add in to the dark side <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
<malay>aku dah macam</malay>
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
(um) from what I see [eh]
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs [ah] maybe she fulfils both not sure
to be fair [kan] <malay>aku</malay> only met his now ex wife [lah] very very few times I think
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here [ah] [ah] the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him [ah]
<malay>abeh kalau dia punya</malay> bad points <malay>aku rasa</malay>
she is too deep in this mentality where <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before <malay>cakap macam</malay>
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
you know they don't have [eh] [eh] concrete plan to do whatever [lah] cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial <malay>ke</malay> emotionally or both usually both [lah]
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks [ah]
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all [lah] definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
ya ya okay it is controversial <malay>tapi</malay>
but <malay>aku</malay> I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating [ah] this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
not saying that it's super common [lah] no [lah] just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
[ah] recklessness (um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay>
probably lack of ambition
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family <malay>punya</malay> background <malay>dia macam</malay> financial background [ah] more than anything [lah] of course [lah] that plays a huge part
[ah] ya privilege [ah] ya [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] to be fair
usually
usually [lah] generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things [ah]
generally speaking [ah]
so based and on that
(um)
scenario like you always quite common [ah] for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible [lah] I'm not saying that
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not [lah] I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her <malay>aku rasa dia punya</malay> other other point
bad point would be
she <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [eh] #fahim# [ah] probably it is [ah] maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is <malay>macam</malay> he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not <malay>macam</malay> many many many times
ya ya <malay>aku</malay> agree [lah] I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
or fittest [lah] even
not not even the fittest man alive [ah]
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
[oh] did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already [lah]
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist [ah]
<malay>aku macam</malay> how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
it's nonsense
ya
no some <malay>apa</malay> no no surprise [lah] where you came from like which country you came from
[sial] [lah] brunei
<malay>aku rasa</malay> that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
ya
(mm)
[oh] is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
ya ya ya
<malay>aku</malay> believe [kan] the country could do much better if the royal family
okay let's just call them government [eh]
if the government invest in their infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism [ah]
for investment
attack tourism [ah]
yup that that's the thing
invest in infrastructure in country <malay>lagi sikit cakap</malay> company
country
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come <malay>abeh lepastu</malay> boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on [ah]
but they don't so <malay>aku</malay> found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia [lah] but still quite bad [lah]
if you look at the [ah] if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free [lah] it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or I think
[ah] then uni isn't free
ya it should be [lah] or very heavily subsidise [ah]
but it's not okay [ah] let's talk about
[oh] so just now you wanted
to ask about
<malay>siapa</malay>
[oh] #khai# right
ya
anything [lah]
ya
[oh]
more
when it comes to that and
other things [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #wan# [ah]
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her [lah]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> find that to be very thought superficial is one thing [lah] the other [one] is
too trivial [lah] to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
<malay>lama</malay> [sia]
<malay>kau</malay> okay you you talk to the guy before [kan]
you know how we talk [kan]
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> [oh] anyway <malay>dia cerita cerita abeh</malay> then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> please [lah] get on to your next point [lah]
something like that [lah]
[oh] mistress
well he consented to it [lah] so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [eh]
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know [ah]
then she slimmer
ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> find that
<malay>macam</malay>
if you want to do this
<malay>takpe</malay> why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial [lah] [eh] he said this one line [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> palm his face [ah] he said you know initially I thought
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out #wai# was the one who needed help
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me [lah] [sia]
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> please please please don't give me a
so ya
I mean that's why he deal [lah] him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant [lah] rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
<malay>macam</malay> there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married [lah] if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her [lah] personally
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see [lah] for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue <malay>ke tak</malay> if it's what you really want then go for it of course [lah] no one listens to my advice [pe] <malay>aku</malay> [kan] just an <malay>apa</malay>
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
which which she should have done from the start [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu kenapa</malay> she still engaged to follow him around
<malay>aku</malay> just find that very creepy
<malay>korang dah</malay>
<malay>takde</malay> anything anymore together <malay>asal kau</malay> do this also I don't know
ya probably yup
[oh] six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying [oh] my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much <malay>macam</malay> you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her [lah]
fifty percent is fine [what] it's both of your kid anyway
<malay>macam aku</malay> don't agree with the mentality [ah] <malay>ada orang cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua kerja perempuan macam</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>ni ni untuk kau</malay>
<malay>salah tu semua salah ni</malay>
ya
<malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> you know some people would step up [ah] <malay>dorang macam</malay> believe that they are better at it
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it [lah]
yes I do only <malay>aku</malay> only one t-shirt <malay>aku</malay> don't iron
the rest I have to iron
it's good to have one <malay>kau</malay> at least buy a steamer [ah]
<malay>masai</malay> [sia] <malay>tak</malay> iron
yes exactly
[oh] okay [ah]
(um) so <malay>aku</malay>
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
you know lose not losing weight <malay>apa</malay>
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
#safwan# told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
he said he was at her play [ah] their place [ah] her place there there so long if he was their place he and #din# this <malay>mat salleh melayu aku</malay> very confused
his name is #saifuddin#
his balding <malay>tak penting</malay> [ah] but
both of them went over to #fahim# place <malay>abeh</malay> [ah] #ruqayyah# was asleep
then #zafran# I think #zafran# has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her [lah]
so I don't know
<malay>macam aku</malay> gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain [lah] cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared [sia] to the point where <malay>aku</malay> realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it [lah] I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] when life is good
ya [lah] I I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> you can tell [what] there's a huge difference when you look at the photo <malay>macam</malay> from six days ago <malay>ke</malay> ten years ago
then <malay>macam</malay>
[eh]
I really gain like twenty kilo [sia] <malay>macam</malay> you can tell [lah] [pe] the difference
I think for me <malay>aku</malay> at most gain about
ten around ten <malay>aku</malay> actually gain more initially then I <malay>aku</malay> started losing weight
I'm on a
<malay>aku</malay> controlling my food intake these days
<malay>aku</malay> don't really care what I eat more of
the frequency of how how I eat
ya <malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>aku</malay> the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult [ah]
then the second meal let's say if you eat <malay>macam merepek minang</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just had <malay>minang</malay> again yesterday best decision ever
!huh!
<malay>lepastu</malay> end up <malay>kau</malay> confirm <malay>lapar</malay> [pe]

okay fine
<malay>atau</malay> swing <malay>taruk dekat</malay> living room [ah] living room <malay>lagi nampak</malay>
(hmm)
okay so you want to put on the wall
the <malay>yang</malay>
okay okay
[eh] but but
but they provide the
mount <malay>nak kena</malay> pay extra [eh]
mount <malay>cuba kalau</malay> because if we mount <malay>kita tak boleh alih-alih</malay> [kan]
<malay>faham tak</malay>
why do I want to <malay>alih-alih</malay> [kan]
if let's say ya <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>macam kat rumah awak</malay>
[kan] <malay>macam mak</malay>
from this side then <malay>dia nak</malay> change to the other side
[ah] <malay>lepastu ni sekarang dia nak</malay> change to this side <malay>balik</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam dia boleh</malay> change <malay>tapi kalau</malay> [dah] mount
[dah] <malay>tak boleh tukar</malay> [dah] <malay>tak boleh ubah</malay>
the mount is inside the wall
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down <malay>mana nak taruk</malay> <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>boleh memang betul</malay> but then
if we want to mount
<malay>dekat</malay> wall the other side is not
is not a wall it's a
wooden wall <malay>faham tak</malay>
it's not a actual wall it's a wooden wall
(mm)
but if you put it on a console
<malay>dia boleh alih</malay> even with the console <malay>dia boleh alih</malay>
[ah]
like that
<malay>sama juga</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>kalau kita ada</malay> console
we can move it to the window <malay>macam</malay> my house
ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> my house <malay>dia tak</malay> mount [kan] then on on top the console [pe]
[ah] so <malay>dia boleh alih-alih</malay>
so from there <malay>dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat</malay> wall <malay>atau dia boleh dekat</malay> this wall
[ah]
that's what I mean so
so you can you can actually <malay>macam</malay> if let's say this year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay> then next year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay>
[ah] <malay>tukar</malay> mood you know <malay>tukar tukar tempat ke</malay>
it it might you know we don't know which which [one] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kena dengan kita</malay> [pe]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) correct correct
no lights can just <malay>tampal belakang</malay> [jer]
<malay>tampal belakang</malay>
so the light shine <malay>dekat tembok</malay>
it moves with the it moves with the console [mah]
so it it if <malay>kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tak</malay> shine
<malay>dia boleh</malay> shine <malay>boleh boleh</malay> shine <malay>tapi tak nampak sangat</malay> [ah]
not that not that really nice [lah]
but if you put on the wall <malay>kalau</malay> [ah] facing the wall
then the the light will show <malay>apa</malay>
will <malay>memacarkan</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dia punya dia punya cahaya dia memacar</malay>
<malay>cahaya dia boleh memacar</malay>
<malay>dekat</malay> wall
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya true
<malay>memang nanti nanti pun pasal belum</malay>
<malay>belum apa belum tahu nak pasang ke tak</malay>
but it will be cool [lah]
<malay>kalau pasang</malay>
(mm)
of course [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah]

<malay>putih</malay> [eh]
then <malay>sini macam</malay> grey
and then <malay>sini putih sini</malay> grey
so that it will look <malay>macam apa</malay> [tau] how to say [eh]

[ah] okay
never mind
we see how we see how
okay then so you mean that you want the same colour but in a different
tone of the colour

(mmhmm)
okay okay

that chemical

[orh] I'm okay [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> lately <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] because (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> COVID [kan] so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
<malay>atau</malay> just (uh) watch new dramas [lah] basically
ya
what's your favourite
ya ya ya ya
correct correct then the one that I regret the most <malay>sekarang</malay> is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> the one that you invited me to watch [ah] demon slayer
ya
(uh) because the thing is like (uh) when I first saw the trailer
for me personally right [ah] (uh) <malay>aku bukan</malay> a fan of <malay>apa ni macam</malay> cute cute (uh) type of (err) art style for the (err) anime for me I prefer like <malay>macam</malay> semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret <malay>gila</malay> serious because it's like (uh) the storyline <malay>bagus</malay> and then like <malay>dia punya</malay> action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away [ah] so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right (uh) it was
I was quite behind the hype already [lah] in a way
ya
(um)
[orh] okay
ya because (uh)
when I started (uh) I think I don't know how like (err) I was in cause I think (um) a lot of people watch already but [ah] even then when I watch later the hype was still there so (err) the main thing for me it's just I can't wait for season two so (uh) I haven't started yet but I'm going to try watch the #manga# [eh] I I'm gonna read the #manga# sorry not watch ya but it was really good [lah] ya
(mm)
then it ended
[orh] september
[oh] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
[oh] one shot [ah]
rise up [ah] ya
ya
(mm) (mm)
#naruto#
[ah]
(mm)
ya
that's why but (err) but (err) adding on to <malay>yang</malay> the older <malay>punya</malay> #animes# even initial D <malay>pun</malay> [kan] it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then <malay>macam</malay> it got so much hype and like so much (um) (err) attention right it just blows my mind [ah] ya and I really thought it's it's really nice [lah] and
not gonna lie [ah] it's very rare (um) for this kind of (err) shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause [ah] the part <malay>yang</malay>
(err) I think is the one <malay>yang</malay> the second episode <malay>yang dia pergi bunuh</malay> the very big demon then he touch the head
(uh) ya the the the one who killed the <malay>punya kawan</malay>
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was (um) the <malay>apa</malay> moon that got strip of his (uh) power <malay>pasal dia tak</malay> (uh) eat enough humans the one who use the drums [ah]
ya (uh) I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then <malay>tak ada orang</malay> appreciate <malay>dia</malay> so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
(uh) <malay>terkesan</malay> like I was like shocked [lah] when I cried a bit I was like [eh] <malay>tak pernah pernah macam gini</malay> the last time I cried was like (err) what endgame
[ah] (um) avengers endgame [ah]
very rare so I was blown away [ah]
[ah] no [lah] ya ya
(mm) (mm)
<malay>kompang</malay> <malay>kompang</malay> <malay>gitu</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi tapi</malay> stress [ah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya</malay> battle <malay>tu</malay> the other one that (err) was more stressful was the <malay>punya</malay> the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
ya lumen six ya but
ya he's so strong he got so pissed off when (uh) #nezuko# and #tanjiro# killed him but he attach his neck using the spider web but for me like what the heck seriously he just cut off [what] it's such a coward move but #gui# is just
<malay>sekali</malay> a one time slash then <malay>mati</malay>
that's why <malay>tak</malay> fair <malay>gila</malay> serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct
ya
(mm)
blow me away it's okay
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya even the intro <malay>dia punya</malay> what they call it opening I don't know opening [ah] the opening was also quite <malay>macam</malay> blood pumping [ah] for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally [eh] for you is the music [kan] for me is the [ah] story line itself
ya and the part when he everytime when he kill the demon right he always like
(um) (uh) give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect <malay>macam dia tak</malay> just <malay>bunuh</malay> cause [oh] you're a demon cause (err) he take the time to like understand them look back [ah] look through their memories and then like say like [eh] you used to be human [lah] so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
(uh) I think that's the main [ah] unique point of [ah] demon slayer it's not just about killing demons it's about having a heart
(mm)
correct correct
(mm)
correct correct yes
ya ya ya
(mm)
correct
ya correct
ya that's why but the thing the thing that (uh) (um)
I I kind of (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> regret a bit right apart from (um) not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that (err) to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> I look <malay>macam</malay> [ah] sometimes look at the art style <malay>macam</malay> very cutesy cutesy <malay>dia macam takda</malay> substance to it [ah] but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some #animes# are good it's not everytime <malay>macam</malay> those like (uh) act cute <malay>atau macam</malay> very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the #animes# are really damn good so <malay>aku macam</malay> semi regret so for me personally [ah] for demon slayer right I started on #naruto#
(um) [ah] I know it's one of the best #animes# but draggy <malay>gila</malay> it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch [ah] but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also [ah] the day before <malay>pasal</malay> one piece so that [one] will try so I start #naruto# first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer #naruto# or one piece [ah] actually
one piece [eh] (uh) because (uh) #naruto# the one I saw on Netflix is like
nine season
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes [lah] so it's not too not too <malay>macam</malay> mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya <malay>tapi</malay> are these sorry is this the format for (err) anime like each episode got twenty minutes <malay>atau</malay>
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> movie is it
[orh] short film
(mm)
ya
[ah]
[pe]
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm <malay>hilang</malay> ya
(mm)
ya
ya
correct correct
standard ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
(uh) bachelor of arts
in game design not bachelor of science [one] science is programing [ah] ya
ya I see your math <malay>semalam</malay> [jer] <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> that's why I I don't take math
ya
(mm)
(mm)
that's why
correct correct <malay>yang semalam</malay> you show me the <malay>pasal apa tu</malay> row operation that [one] obviously I try [ah] but I really I really don't understand [lah] but the first few question I understand [lah] ya
ya [ah] the the velocity part I think
[ah] something like that ya ya but sorry my math <malay>tak bagus sangat</malay>
[ah]
correct
ya ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) famous [ah] ya ya ya
true like cannot generalise
(mm)
(mm)
correct
(mmhmm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
ya
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you [ah] force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself <malay>tak faham</malay> then you have to like (uh) you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt <malay>juga</malay>
when I started
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
correct correct
ya ya
yeah I guess <malay>macam</malay> (uh) if like you if you like <malay>tanya</malay> then like you didn't try then think <malay>macam</malay> people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really <malay>kalau macam</malay> we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about (uh) your course is that (uh) at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally <malay>rabak gila</malay> [ah] [ah] I take english but then like (err) if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment <malay>juga</malay>
ya ya cause <malay>mak kau cikgu</malay> ya ya ya that's why it's it's true [ah] like I I always thought I had the mindset like <malay>boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri</malay> just <malay>belajar</malay> [jer] just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you [ah] they call it (um) crystallisation of your thinking like make your (uh) [ah] word flow much more (uh) smoother [ah] in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya [eh] <malay>tak tak</malay> I I saw in my study guide <malay>apa</malay> crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation (uh) like (um) basically they encourage <malay>macam</malay> (um) making study groups and all that cause for me like (uh) like you (err) yourself [ah] <malay>aku pun</malay> introvert that time (um) when I want to try ask <malay>macam malu-malu</malay> cause I feel #paiseh# [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
people think like you don't do your (err) revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is [ah] sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
(mm)
ya
[oh] this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe [ah]
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
ya
(uh) ya ya ya ya ya
in a way [ah] in the same time at the same time from what you explain <malay>macam</malay> is to juggle the <malay>perasaan</malay> of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
(um) some (um) I think it's very rare [lah] that there are people who are very <malay>macam</malay> clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to <malay>jaga hati</malay> and try to be more mindful what they say
but it depends on the person itself [lah] but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice [ah] ya when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
as very (um) ruthless or very blunt [lah] <malay>macam</malay> later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel <malay>macam</malay> very (um)
[ah] that's why that's why <malay>rasa kecil hati kirakan</malay> ya
ya
ya
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] then when they continue doing that then they don't learn [kan] they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise <malay>asal semua orang</malay> keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me <malay>masa dulu</malay> I was very sensitive so now I try to <malay>macam</malay> balance out [lah]
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best [lah] cause over time like you have to
(um) adapt [ah] I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
(uh)
ya can I share one story ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> I'm guilty of this so (err) so (err) (err) (err) the the one thing that (err) you mentioned about time management there is it for me [kan] honestly speaking [ah]
(err) for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest [ah] this one I haven't share with you before (uh) so (um)
I kind of (err) didn't sit for my paper
ya so (err) this news right I'm just telling you this (um) okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that (um) if you don't sit for your paper
and then (uh) if you have (err) I think the requirement for the assignments is like (err) forty percent and above that means your over [ah] there are two components (uh) assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without (err) redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod [ah] so
for me
okay [lah] for me since I'm new to it [lah] like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
balance and all that so I admit [ah] sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so (um) before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I (uh) consulted (err) my partner and my mother then they said that is fine [lah] then I think about it <malay>macam tak</malay> affect my grade cause there was a time before [what] I failed my exam then my (uh) drop <malay>rabak gila</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like (um) if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just (err) restudy [lah] and the good thing [ah] about my school now is that since COVID right (uh) they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right (uh) you have to pay the fee [tau] it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free [lah] cause of COVID so like I'll just do it [lah] but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty <malay>macam</malay> I feel so bad <malay>macam kirakan</malay> I can clear the mod [one] then <malay>macam</malay> I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again (uh) cause (uh) the last time I checked if I fail again [kan]
<malay>aku boleh tendang sekolah</malay> [lah] like fully [ah] I (err) I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is (err) academic termination then you have to it's as if (err) after you <malay>kena</malay> terminated it's as if you have to (err) re-enrolled [lah] to the school so that's the downside [lah] so I'm like [ah] I don't wanna take the risk [ah] I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh]
like like
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away <malay>kena</malay> that kind of
[oh] range [oh] okay okay okay
[ah] [ah] that's what I <malay>kena</malay> ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos [ah] if I'm being honest so like I think about it [ah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] just resit [ah]
I don't want to risk it ya <malay>sakit</malay> [sia] <malay>hati</malay> that time ya
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot entirely relate and I don't have the right to [lah] cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right [oh] for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different [ah] assignments and projects ya so because your school is (uh) assignment and project based my [one] is [ah] exam so that's the thing you all also have (err)
intermittent exams right
math [oh] my goodness
don't have (err)
(uh) not exactly math but I think (err) since your mum is a english teacher she should know also (err) there's this thing called (err) phonetics and (um) what is it under [ah] it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like (um) if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
(um) put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a (um) sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part [lah]
(uh)
there is one ya ya there is (uh) the (uh) what mod I took I think they taught us about (err) there are some similarities (uh) between (err) varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
(uh) are there but how there are different so that (um) when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english [eh] I'm if I'm speaking english and <malay>kau cakap macam</malay> [ah] there are structures to it that make it different [ah] I think it's [ah] sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages [ah]
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya something like that [lah] like they have a (uh) a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences [ah] ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages [ah] if like you use (uh) malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like <malay>susah</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
(um) ya [lah] because essentially
it's a translation but then like (err) one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like (err) the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part [ah] ya I think there was once I I look (err) the one that my prof taught me was (err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
professor ya sorry (err) professor [ah] [eh] [ah] so casual <malay>panggil</malay> prof (uh) she talk about english in (uh) do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya <malay>allah</malay> [eh] sorry sorry (err) so basically (um)
(err) they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office [sia]
<malay>pejabat</malay> office right
[ah] <malay>pejabat pos</malay> so it's like it's reverse [ah] so that's the different thing
[oh] ya but okay [lah] (uh) that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about (err)
language and society like how people use language and all that that [one] is more to (um)
I would say (uh) you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how [ah] different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
[ah] dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's (uh) in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of (err) analytical type of a more research based type ya
these two is okay the one that really
headache now [eh] I wish I I don't have to take is (uh) literature
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it [ah] so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so <malay>panjang</malay> right so like [ah] [tau] <malay>boleh takpe</malay> [lah] just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly (uh) change it like that like (um) they just make it english language and literature like (um) why they don't have the presets cause last time (uh) when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that (um)
but they rebrand it so like no choice [ah] I just stayed [ah] cause I have to defer for (err) one semester

<malay>apa ni</malay> putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you

correct (uh) there's one prime example (uh) I think is everyone's favourite
unfortunately he died already [ah] it's iron man games of thrones <malay>tak</malay> game of thrones <malay>tak</malay> that (uh) one prime (uh) character in the Marvel (uh)
wait is he is not right [ah] Marvel cinematic universe [ah] iron man [ah] he don't have any powers but like he he's (uh) drive to make the world a better place and too (um) I think in age of ultron he said he want to like (uh) have a iron barrier around earth (uh) to like sort of protect [lah] but (um) even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like (uh) protect what's what matters to him the most [ah] so like (um)
(uh) adding to your part <malay>macam</malay> (uh) when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
get the power from your own (uh)
belief and then like [ah] actually (um) it's not technically a superpower [lah] but it's more of like it's (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err)
his ability to (uh) be a genius
and like (uh) construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it [lah] like people always look at the (uh) powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
(uh) thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right [ah] and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes [ah] and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing [eh] cause I just realised this now I'm having this (uh) [eh] epiphany <malay>macam</malay> if you notice [eh] in endgame
(uh) black widow and iron man <malay>tak ada</malay> power [tau] but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then (uh) iron man <malay>dia</malay> (uh) take the <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) gauntlet from (err) thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really [ah] all the efforts for nothing but then like (err) he managed to get all the infinity stones on his (uh) hand then he just snap [ah] so it takes a lot of (um) courage to do that you know so like it was is is really (um) mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
I think she was like (err) (um)
(uh) assassin or some sort then she got (um) (err) close combat (err) training and iron man is just (err) a man with a suit [lah] but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite (err) touching [ah] if you think about it no power [tau]
(mm)
ya
correct
yes
(mm)

it's very tough it's not it's not that easy to reach out to people [ah]
(mm)
yes
<malay>dan</malay> cause also (um)
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice (um)
in the traineeship or the united jobs right cause like since I only part time now [ah] [eh] I'm working part time [lah] ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry [ah] but my job got suspended because of COVID so like (err) I cannot work for the meantime so (um) I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy [ah] but it's you're on the right track [ah] so it is relevant [lah] it's a good thing
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes

so so so so technically they are like you but they they because of the (err) pre-judgement that they might get they just keep quiet and they don't want to approach anyone
like it's even more (um) [ah] amplified [lah] I guess <malay>lagi lagi malu</malay> [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
ya
ya
yes

it's very useful

ya
ya
but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like (err) I I heard there's zero the zero gravity why am I stuttering (uh) the zero gravity there is quite (uh)
quite intense [ah] so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve (uh) being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something [ah]
ya cause if he want to be married [eh] buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)

that's why

it's another planet

<malay>atau</malay> Grab express (uh) deliver parcel
ya but how many light years away is mars [ah]
I never thought about it [eh]
ya
[oh] it's not light years
years
[oh] but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough [eh]
I don't know how they do it [sia] seriously
ya ya ya correct
young [ah] !wah! that's a good thing [eh] like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya ya [orh] then (err) it'll be relatable to (uh) demon slayer when (uh) in the movie (uh) what's his name [eh] [ah] correct me if I'm wrong [ah] #asaka# <malay>ke</malay> #akaza# #akaza# he wanted to offer (uh) #rengoku# to be a a demon [what] ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die [ah] so
(um) if you remain at technically if you get to live forever <malay>atau</malay> you (um) remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it (uh) like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive [ah] then you wouldn't die [ah]
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm) (mm)
that's right
ya ya ya
<malay>takyah mandi</malay>
ya
correct correct ya ya ya
ya
because you don't have to drive to progress [ah] then like you just stay stagnant [ah] like (uh) because it's not affecting you [what] and that's the thing about humans [lah] like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
but probably why [ah] sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable [ah] (err) probably why the <malay>apa</malay> six demon didn't (uh)
change [ah] the [ah] sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change [ah] but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the #manga# or the watch the (uh) talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of (um)
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph [ah]
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
that's the sad thing right people only recognise people when they die unfortunately
that's a sad thing
ya
(mm)
ya
ya and they look to you as a way to (err)
is #bangkok# the correct word like a way to (um) set the bar like I I (err) do as an inspiration [ah] in a way
ya
so that's the good thing

I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb [eh] I guess [ah] when people pass on they look at the good things [ah] and they try to overlook the (uh) bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
(um) his negative aspects (um) (err)
even though they were quite drastic but (uh) the achievements overshadow that [ah] but in the end when everyone passes on right is (um)
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them [ah] recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper (um)
what's the word [eh] passing [eh] no (um) [ah] final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status (err) for awhile then like (um) at least you (um) go in peace [ah] like ya you don't feel like [oh] (um)
there's anything left
[ah] ya ya ya you you feel like (err) a burden off your shoulder [ah] in a way
what's why
(mm)
making one of the best anime
[oh] my goodness
ya
(mm)
that's why it's amazing how this (um) shows like Marvel anime and all these right like they teach us more
than what we are taught in school it's really interesting right
ya
okay
(uh)

okay so after that the third year <malay>engkau</malay> move out because with your aunty and then
(uh huh)
[ah]
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
ya but is it your own your own <malay>punya</malay> feeling or <malay>memang</malay> they are the one who gave you hints
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents [ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> when you go back that time (uh) like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
(mm)
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
ya ya but you and her now <malay>dah</malay> okay [lah]
like become such a cool mum [ah]
having disputes [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree [lah] you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life [lah] mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy [lah] you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my <malay>nakal</malay> my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school [lah] they get into they they start to steal from shop [lah] that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument [ah] so <malay>aku suka jawab</malay> [jer] you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum [lah] you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course [lah] you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you [lah] you know you ended up becoming a fight often [ah] but for our case is not religious matters [lah] for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche [lah] because she was a single mother for awhile
[ah] so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] ya ya so I can understand her stress [ah] she was the old school hard knocks kind [lah] you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind [lah] if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness [lah] so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and (um) I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
[ah] when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two (err) I stayed at (uh) you know those government rental house ya I I stayed (uh) using (uh) someone's name [lah] ya because that person had was sick so she (uh) the <malay>nenek</malay> like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus [lah] ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely [lah] I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area (uh) my my house was at outram there the old school #jalan kukoh# [lah] you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better [ah]
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot [lah] and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay (uh) when when I was in my early twenties <malay>kita</malay> actually <malay>nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah</malay> so by right we already moved to #yishun# way back already [tau] but then (err) this (err) it's a it's a chinese family [lah] so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house [ah] so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room [lah] my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us [lah] but you can feel [lah] after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like <malay>rimas</malay> if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate [lah] then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you [lah] the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight [lah] like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve [tau] but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her !alah! she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like <malay>kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke</malay> you know
yes
passionate [ah] <malay>kira</malay> defensive [ah]
grow up
ya
tense up [ah] [ah]
ya ya
fight [ah] ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing [ah] ya
ya ya
ya
[a'ah]
[ah]
probably probably ya
(mm)
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear [lah] [ah] if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why [ah] what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside [leh] you look soft outside and inside you are [eh] fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it [ah]
adamant [ah]
[oh] okay okay okay
ya
(mm)
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] you know what dude actually what right (uh) one thing you should actually I recommend [lah] you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book [ah] dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that [eh] no no some people actually (uh) you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique [lah] then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a !wah! dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what [lah] but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good [lah]
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook [ah] and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F [ah]
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example [lah] (uh) you know like how sometimes people (um) okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very #nya# one the #nya# one [ah] actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before [ah] !wah! sometimes when people in the level of managerial position [ah] are sometimes very #guai lan# you know bro <malay>dia orang</malay>
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel (um) wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the #mats# can walk like that or the #bengs# they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
ya [lah] but no [lah] I truly mean it empathise [lah] <malay>kau jangan ketawa</malay> now you make me feel bad for laughing
like !whoa! so big like they as if they got like big triceps [ah] that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also [lah] ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
[oh] really [ah]
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time [lah] [ah]
opening [ah] ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
[a'ah] then then then
I I think so [ah] why [ah] recall recall recall help me recall
[oh] ya okay okay then then then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
!oi! my memory very bad [lah] bro very bad bro (mm)
(mm)
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
[ah]
ya
ya
okay
something new [ah]
(oo)
[eh] but dude I thought all this while <malay>memang</malay> you were actually very motivated to be a pilot [what] no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
okay [ah]
ya ya you can like transfer [ah] ya

ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky [ah] that person should never have been a pilot [sia] but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be

okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
[eh] no [lah] because new house you say you use [mah] you don't have to cash contribute [what] <malay>ada</malay> how much
!oi! okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room [ah]
but you're
ya
[ah] who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
[eh] that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know [ah] it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no [ah]
just a cross [ah] [oh] okay
no you know why because I don't know [lah] it depends on my future [lah] because for now there's a lot of changes [ah] okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
#dubai# right #dubai# airline is it
[oh]
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience [ah]
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that [lah]
[ah]
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit [lah] ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry [lah] the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts [ah]
(mm)
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal [ah]
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
(mm)
!wah! how many airplanes [sia] bro like that
!wah! I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue [lah] like from steward to be flying [lah] okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is (uh) my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
[oh] you went through the three months [ah] [oh] it was supposed to be that stage already [lah] [oh]
!wah! dude that time if you fly [ah] your inter pretty stable and nice [ah] bro four to six K easily [sia]
[eh] but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know <malay>nasib kentang</malay> [eh] like like first okay [lah] the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID <malay>pula</malay> happen like !wow!
your <malay>nasib</malay> is so <malay>kentang</malay> [lah] dude
<malay>nasib kau sangat kentang</malay> bro I don't know why I say <malay>kentang</malay> [ah] but I feel like it sounds right <malay>nasib kau kentang</malay>
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike [ah]
ya ya
!walao! I don't think that's anywhere close [sia]
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there [sia] on the drone
okay
that's relatable [lah]
[ah] okay okay so it's just a matter of time [lah]
another <malay>ujian</malay>
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to #salihin# <malay>ni</malay> edwin <malay>jadi nyanyuk</malay> ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there <malay>orang yang dalam</malay> asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you [siol] [lah] funny [sia]
[siol] [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of #mumammad salihin#
ya then eventually when people see the peak [ah] [lah] it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession [eh] but okay [lah] but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story [lah] I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist [ah] so she's like a old lady [lah] you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage [lah] like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just <malay>macam</malay> smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya like for you you are like [oh] crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum [lah] so ya but but but no [lah] I I wish you all the best [ah] brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it [lah] it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field [oh]
(mm)
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him [ah] ya like before him right you see bush !wah! everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him [ah] the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman [lah]
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics [ah] in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no [lah] bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back [eh] okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that [lah] but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead [mah] like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks [what] the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people [lah] the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have #genghis khan# you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them [lah] you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that (um) people just have space to voice out things
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing [what] you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you <malay>kena</malay> arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you <malay>kena</malay> arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing [lah] as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see [lah]
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person [lah] how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now [lah] because if I go there I will die of boredom [sia]
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand [mah] so <malay>aku</malay> anytime can just like you know [eh]
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something [lah] but I'm not in touch with him that much [lah]
he's a new zealander but <malay>sekarang</malay> he stay in australia
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old [lah] I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains [ah] then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom [lah] there's nothing to do [sia] there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know [lah] okay
no it's not about <malay>mahal</malay> bro even if it's not <malay>mahal</malay> you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand <malay>macam mana</malay> if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example [lah] like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and (um) I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how [sia]
a plan [ah]
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business [lah] [oh] I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no [lah] basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay [lah] I will just give you a brief verbal presentation [ah] people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example [oh] bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why [oh] why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
[ah]
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much [mah]
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say [oh] my house will <malay>kena tarik</malay> they will say [oh] I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
the only reason how they can <malay>tarik</malay> your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
they will just cut your utility [lor]
ya
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house <malay>kena tarik</malay> not true okay number two (uh) you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy (uh) I give you one one scenario [lah] one of one of this person [oh] like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount [lah] so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay [lah] you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
because your will still cut [mah] <malay>bulan-bulan</malay> for the house [ah] okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you [ah] bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people [lah] okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole [lah] which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor [lah] okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk [mah] you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan [lah] okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets [lah] you know you buy Rolex [lah] you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there [mah]
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions [lah] your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong [lah] but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example [ah] they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government (uh) supreme court order you to pay [lah] like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone [lah] that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years [lah] depending on the amount that you have to pay (err) so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that [one] right they are the people like [ah] fuck it [lah] I don't want to pay <malay>aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat</malay> [ah] so if they never pay then they cannot travel
they have to stay in singapore [ah]
cannot [ah]
their their their passport is blocked [what] they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead [lah] you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go [lah] you know
ya
but it's not like so long in advance <malay>pun</malay> you know it's just like a day probably you know [ah] but the thing is people thought [oh] cannot that kind of thing
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you (uh) they cannot [lah] they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay [lah] they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy [ah] so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna (uh) work in production houses if the company feel like [eh] there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you [lor] private entity [what]
[ah] so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
[ah] like this kind of job [ah] the one that is got profile [one] [ah] they normally will not hire you [one]
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system [lah] ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests [ah]
ya [lah] for example okay I give you a scenario [ah] let's say you owe ten thousand [lah] the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred [lah]
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month [lah] okay
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will <malay>tambah balik</malay> one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario [lah] so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay [lah] let's say you you a newly married couple [lah] okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans [mah]
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial (uh) the debt trap [ah] okay so the second way is to pay a minimum [eh]
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay <malay>habis</malay> [kan] another thing [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the second way let's say <malay>macam</malay> the minimum [eh] some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the <malay>susu</malay> pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come [lah] lawyer letter come [lah]
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic [ah] this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see [lah] they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country [lah] [ah] so [ah] normally they have their debt consolidation plan [lah] that debt management program [lah] all these thing [lah] this is by the by the banks [lah] of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria [lah] you know you are [eh] <malay>aku rasa dah habis</malay> [ah] bro okay [lah] five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done [ah] okay

hi I'm okay
!alamak! <malay>minta tolong apa</malay>

I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops <malay>tak</malay> okay I'm like really like come on [lah] like give chance a bit [lah] like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously [lah] that is true <malay>tapi macam kelakar</malay> because at the beginning <malay>bila</malay> this started <malay>semua orang macam</malay> !alamak! #kanchiong# #kanchiong# spider you know <malay>macam</malay> !alamak!
okay how [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how to check in how know contact tracing [lah] this and that and then after that after awhile
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
(hmm)
I think right the best <malay>kalau ada duit beli</malay> online <malay>sudah</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>betul memang memang</malay> my mum also experience that before <malay>dia beli apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kelakar</malay> it's not just <malay>baju</malay> [eh] it's like <malay>barang-barang rumah sekali</malay> after that <malay>dia punya</malay> colour <malay>lain</malay> and then <malay>dia punya</malay> size <malay>pun lain</malay>
<malay>ada boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> all those order <malay>macam</malay> order from china all that how to how to return back [seh]

and then <malay>sekali datang</malay> like that time okay it's funny that time [eh] I'm sure you <malay>mesti</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> story <malay>pasal</malay> like failed grab delivery <malay>punya apa tu</malay>
(err)
<malay>punya</malay> orders my god my my time <malay>bila</malay> I mean my experience so far is like [oh] my god
like it's really crazy like okay example [leh] that time I <malay>beli ayam penyet</malay> and then you know what happen <malay>nasi tak datang boleh gitu</malay> order <malay>ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi nasi</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> and then <malay>bila bila</malay> complain <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> firstly <malay>dia orang tak angkat</malay> phone <malay>abeh dah dah gitu</malay> and then <malay>nak tanya</malay> [lah]
<malay>mana mana nasi</malay> [kan] <malay>nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang</malay> order <malay>nasi lemak tak ada nasi</malay> order <malay>nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar</malay>
and then <malay>dah lapar</malay> and then after that <malay>dia orang boleh cakap</malay> [oh] I think the <malay>nasi dia orang</malay> either <malay>dia orang lupa atau</malay> driver <malay>makan</malay> !huh! <malay>tak</malay> I don't know <malay>nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa</malay>
you imagine if it's you <malay>kalau</malay> if it's your if you are in my shoes <malay>tak marah</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> <malay>nak tunggukan nasi</malay> and then <malay>takkan</malay> so the the <malay>kelakar</malay> part is the <malay>kelakar</malay> part of the story is what know
<malay>bila</malay> I call them to go and say that <malay>the nasi tak ada</malay> and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
and then they they said (err) depends [ah] ma'am depends I said !huh!
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say [ah] <malay>tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke</malay> and then
<malay>kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia cakap</malay> ma'am because right the restaurant (err) a lot of order [ah] ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait [ah] maybe one or two hours <malay>untuk satu nasi</malay> I'm like [ah]
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] in the end my mum <malay>masak nasi sendiri</malay> [ah] so thanks [lah] so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
<malay>satu jam</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>mesti dah</malay>
<malay>dah membara</malay> you know like <malay>dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> still <malay>nak tunggu satu jam</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli</malay> mcdonald's <malay>sudah</malay>
circuit breaker ya [orh]
ya [lah] <malay>masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak</malay> clean up <malay>tu nak bersihkan</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
[ah] !wah! <malay>mesti</malay> crowded <malay>gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>abeh</malay> !huh! cancel
<malay>abeh</malay>
(mm) on that day itself [ah] [orh] okay okay
[eh] [eh] <malay>jahatnya sedih</malay>
(mm) (mm)
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing [seh] it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job [lah] basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like (uh) mcdonald's then okay ya (err) like customer number one two three four and then they just say [ah] ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
(mm)
so I think also <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the restaurant <malay>nak</malay> blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end <malay>siapa yang</malay> suffer [seh]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dia punya gaji bukannya berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kesian</malay> (mm) (mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] I mean I <malay>selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan</malay> motor [lah] <malay>dengan kereta</malay> [lah] and then
<malay>selalu macam</malay> you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so <malay>macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam susah</malay> you know <malay>macam kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya</malay>
<malay>apa tu dia orang punya</malay> job [lah] like <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer [lah]
(mm)
[eh] [eh] <malay>baiknya</malay> [lah] [eh] [eh] <malay>siapa</malay> [seh] <malay>tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu</malay> as in tip in cash or !huh! [oh] my god
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua</malay> still <malay>ada</malay> comment [lah] singaporeans standard [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>bukan</malay> singaporean <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay> order <malay>macam</malay> like that time <malay>baru</malay> my friend order <malay>apa</malay> [eh] I think <malay>dia</malay> order
<malay>susah kalau</malay> I mean that time my friend <malay>pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang</malay> [eh] that time my friend order during <malay>bulan puasa</malay> [ah] during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk [lah] because <malay>dia orang ada macam</malay>
<malay>apa macam</malay> (err) open house [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> open house <malay>macam</malay>
(err) family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be [lah] you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is <malay>dia hantar banyak rumah</malay> so they order <malay>macam</malay> maybe like four packet like <malay>empat</malay> packet <malay>satu rumah</malay>
so altogether maybe about <malay>empat puluh</malay> packet they just put you know [lah]
malay family <malay>banyak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia baik hati</malay> [lah] because like one of the days <malay>dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan</malay> so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the <malay>makanan basi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi</malay> and then <malay>macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan</malay>
so <malay>dia punya</malay> order <malay>datang pukul empat</malay>
and then <malay>dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas</malay> and then after that <malay>makanan dia basi</malay> so <malay>satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih</malay>
[ah] <malay>abeh yang kelakar punya yang</malay> the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that (err) food stall <malay>dia boleh cakap apa</malay> [tau] [oh] (err) sorry [ah] to customer who got the food that is <malay>basi</malay>
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business !huh!
<malay>tak</malay>
[ah] [ah] so also <malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] because okay [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you <malay>macam</malay> a bit of refund or what [lah] but because they are
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like !huh!
correct and then <malay>nasi</malay> I mean okay <malay>nasi padang</malay> [eh] maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month [eh] plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus [tau] then imagine half of the <malay>nasi basi macam mana gitu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tak ada tak ada tak ada</malay> refund <malay>tak ada dia boleh cakap</malay> [oh] we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian</malay> and then it's like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pergi mana</malay> cycling <malay>kat mana</malay> [seh]
<malay>boleh juga</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tapi esok</malay> sunday [seh] confirm <malay>banyak orang</malay>
[oh] <malay>masih</malay>
[ah] [ah] <malay>sama</malay> mountain bike [ah] <malay>sama tak tak tak tukar</malay>
[oh] my god really

<malay>mana</malay> best <malay>nasi lemak semua</malay> best [ah] depends [ah] <malay>yang mana</malay> depends on <malay>apa</malay> like you <malay>suka tapi</malay> more or less <malay>sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah</malay> [kan] <malay>apa apa yang beza dia</malay>
[kan] unless it's <malay>sama apa kalau nasi lemak</malay> I mean okay [lah] the good thing is that <malay>dia punya</malay> price there is like <malay>macam dua</malay> I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya

[ah] [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] it's like and then <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] because nowadays <malay>bila panas</malay> very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time <malay>dekat dekat</malay> singapore I think <malay>kat mana entah</malay> #changi# <malay>ke</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>ke</malay> #bedok# the rain <malay>sampai</malay> flooding <malay>sampai banjir</malay> and then the <malay>banjir</malay> is so bad that
at the bus stop <malay>dia punya orang</malay> is standing on the seat [eh]
and the <malay>air naik</malay> all the way [tau]
<malay>macam bukan kat</malay> singapore [seh]
!huh!
[a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> [a'ah] <malay>betul betul</malay>
ya and then I saw [seh] <malay>banyak orang macam</malay> video

or phase one or something then the <malay>dia punya</malay> it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus [leh] and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
<malay>basah kuyup</malay> [seh] <malay>habis</malay> [ah]
<malay>kesian</malay> (uh) (uh) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] that's why it's like really not like singapore [seh]
(mm) (mm)
and then means weather forecast <malay>semua salah</malay> [lah]
thanks [eh]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain <malay>dia cakap</malay> actually suppose <malay>hujan sampai</malay> tuesday [ah] next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>panas mana tak</malay> dengue <malay>kat</malay> singapore
[ah] maybe [lah] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
weird [leh] no but talking about dengue [oh] my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day <malay>pasal</malay> the dengue case and then one of my colleague <malay>boleh kena</malay> dengue [seh] (uh) (uh) and the <malay>kelakar</malay> part <malay>dia mat salleh</malay>
so #ang moh# [lah] you know and then
<malay>dia dia asyik</malay> I think <malay>dia asyik keluar petang</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>ke apa entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap</malay> [oh] I I was out sick for one week so I said [lah] how are you so I thought maybe (um) like he fever <malay>ke</malay> cause you know [lah] nowadays <malay>kalau sakit</malay> it's like either you <malay>kena</malay> COVID nineteen or you <malay>kena</malay>
dengue and then the funny part is <malay>dia cakap dia kena</malay> dengue
(uh) (uh) confirm and then <malay>dia dah takut</malay> because they <malay>dia ingatkan</malay> that <malay>kena masuk</malay> hospital [lah] so actually <malay>tak payah</malay> because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
ya but it's quite serious [lah] because I don't know
I I I don't know how he got it I think <malay>dia cakap</malay> that maybe because <malay>dia selalu keluar petang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia keluar petang</malay> to go jogging around <malay>dia punya</malay> area and <malay>dia</malay> standard [lah] <malay>dia tinggal dia tinggal kat</malay> robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area [ah] then after that
(err) don't know how he <malay>balik</malay> and then <malay>dia macam dia pening</malay> [lah] <malay>abeh dia batuk-batuk</malay> [lah] and then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia rasa macam</malay> something is wrong [lah] so <malay>dia cakap</malay> actually <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor first time then doctor say [oh] maybe you're just tired because <malay>dia sekarang</malay> [kan] everybody work from home [ah] then after that <malay>dia ingatkan</malay>
okay [lah] maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end <malay>dia pergi</malay> to another doctor the doctor <malay>cakap</malay> dengue then <malay>dia dah</malay> panic [lah]
so <malay>dia macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana ni macam mana</malay> [seh] so <malay>dia dia takut</malay> that <malay>dia kena</malay> hospitalize [lah] because <malay>kalau</malay> hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
[ah]
p[a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] and then nowadays you know [lah] <malay>kalau ambil</malay> is not like those days [lah] [ah] like <malay>dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi</malay> I mean <malay>ambil</malay> <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] one two days stay at home <malay>sekarang</malay> is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss <malay>semua tahu habis</malay> [seh]
(mm) [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
is it <malay>tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak</malay>
[orh]
<malay>abeh macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>dia orang nak</malay> check <malay>macam</malay> I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay [lah] I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like (err) <malay>kat apa tu</malay> at the west side I think #yishun# or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day <malay>ada</malay> fogging [ah]
and then fogging you know [lah] the smell [oh] my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in #yishun# and woodlands they say every other day <malay>ada</malay> fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell <malay>macam nak muntah</malay> [seh] and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
[oh]
(mm) (mm) okay okay
(mm) [orh]
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
my mum even funnier <malay>bila dia dengar pasal</malay> these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my #ang moh# colleague the the guy then his then (err) he said he doesn't know [lah] that because they #ang moh# <malay>apa</malay> he from sweden [ah] <malay>dia tak dia tak dia tak baca</malay> local news <malay>sangat</malay> [lah] <malay>baca pasal</malay> COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world [lah] then but then he never read about the dengue then he said [oh] I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases <malay>sekali</malay> I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases [eh] it's crazy my god
[oh] my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
(mm) aedes correct ya
(mm)
<malay>tapi macam mana</malay> [seh]
<malay>macam mana nak tengok kalau</malay> even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight <malay>macam mana nak tengok</malay>
by the time they want to <malay>gigit</malay> you they just <malay>gigit</malay>
most likely it is [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
so <malay>leceh</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang kalau kalau sakit</malay> then <malay>susah</malay> [tau] <malay>nak kena pergi</malay> doctor [lah] <malay>nak kena</malay> self self isolate [lah] then <malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam-macam</malay> test [seh] <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena ambil</malay> is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know [lah] is hard to predict right ya so <malay>kalau dah</malay>
I don't know [lah] just keep healthy [lah] [ah] just keep on exercising <malay>makan betul-betul jangan makan</malay> all the
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat [lah] once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
he just drink water a lot everyday because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary [ah]
(mm) correct correct
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] nowadays
every other day sure got some story [one]
in the news both (mm) (mm) local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting [sia] I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like [oh] my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day <malay>mesti ada</malay> something you know and it's only what august [oh] my god
crazy (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
!huh! [oh] my god
so scary
[oh] my god
ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>betul susah</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm) fifty five
ya [lor] that's why how [seh] they check everyday like that <malay>tak penat ke macam</malay>
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya [lah] that's true [lah] (mm) (mm) it's a bit more controlled [lah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see [lah] the weather like <malay>panas</malay> [lah] <malay>hujan</malay> [lah] then all the <malay>air bertakung</malay> like that then <malay>mana tak</malay> dengue [seh] ya then there's nobody like
because my house area <malay>ada banyak</malay> new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks <malay>macam seram</malay> [seh] like so quiet (mm) so I guess [lah] because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
more and more ya (mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] correct
[ah] [ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian</malay> [eh]
natural garden [ah]
ya definitely definitely
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>makan</malay> maggi [jer] [lah] <malay>hari-hari</malay> they are also heroes [ah] (mm) (mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like (err) quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that [oh] my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know [lah] I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like

I can't imagine how the businesses can survive man really like every other day don't you realise like a restaurant is going to close a business is closing down blah blah blah like !walao! like
I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about (um) you know using this reserves for
for all the I mean all these schemes [lah] like you said so
<malay>sama</malay> [ah]
(mm) (mm) ya [lor] that's why funny [ah]
(mm) (mm) almost half a year [lah]
(mm) (mm) <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
correct and then <malay>kalau</malay> you know [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> lunch time <malay>situ</malay> not only crowded like raffles and area I mean most times you are like spending so much on your lunch like you know you know lunch you know the lunches are like what
ten to fifteen dollars on average and then and that's like every other day <malay>kalau makan luar</malay> [jer] <malay>dah mahal</malay> imagine like five times a day five times a week you have to do that !walao! like it's a lot of money you know
(mm) (mm)
ya that's on transport food ya
correct like all the small small things [ah] like I think you spend less [lah] when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy <malay>nak pergi</malay> shopping <malay>nak beli apa</malay> [seh]
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah] correct
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
electricity bill [lah] bill <malay>air</malay> bill <malay>api</malay>
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays [ah] I mean you <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
whatever [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> you are
you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
(mm) (mm)
<malay>kelakar</malay> right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees [eh] completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal [lah] you know what I mean
<malay>kalau tidak susah macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay> like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
something that I don't know like
every every singaporean loves you know (mm) (mm) like that day <malay>apa tu baru</malay> national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul nak</malay> fourteen fourteen days <malay>leceh</malay> [lah] <malay>nak pakai</malay> mask [lah] <malay>pakai ni</malay> [lah] and then I don't know like the amount of money that you're spending is not worth it [lah]
ya [lah]
correct correct correct or just do virtual [lor] everything nowadays virtual virtual event
virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I <malay>baru nampak</malay> virtual makeup session then like
but everything [lah] everything is now virtual [lah] like but it's quite actually interesting [lah] like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day <malay>baru</malay> I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
ya that's true (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] netflix [eh] netflix <malay>hari-hari</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
endless [seh] like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also
shows so like imagine like recently they had like growing up you know money no enough
homerun even like malay shows I think what <malay>bunga tanjung</malay> or something like that that they have so it's quite interesting and it's like they have diverse range [lah] like malay english they even have like tamil shows and all that it's quite interesting like I mean I guess
like you say [lah] they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
I think <malay>dah buka</malay> [lah] but like I mean you have to take precaution right
!wah!
funny ya
ya [lah] sometimes no choice is the best choice [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) physical is no longer really needed [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say [lah] just go out for awhile then <malay>balik cepat-cepat</malay> you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
normal I guess you know
(mm) (mm) ya
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks [seh] [oh] my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that [oh] the fireworks you have to do at #padang# because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year [oh] my god so many different places <malay>kat</malay> #tampines# <malay>ada kat</malay> #jurong# I think is it
[ah] !wow! amazing (mm) (mm)
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya [lah] (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) cancelled [kan] [oh] postpone [ah] okay okay
once every four years right (mm) (mm) millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the <malay>duit</malay>
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know [lah] I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
[oh] ya I think I saw that
(mm) (mm)
nature is healing [ah] mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) ya ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) less is more
(mm) (mm)
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving [what] you know
(mm) (mm)
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it [lah] you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell [lah] [oh] okay (mm) (mm) hobby [eh]
<malay>boleh nyanyi</malay> (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya that's true
ya [lah] must be positive [lah] because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you <malay>rasa</malay> like <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa marah</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa sedih</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa ni</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam</malay>
<malay>macam-macam perasaan tapi</malay> at the end of the day <malay>mesti</malay> positive [lah] you know <malay>kalau tak</malay> positive <malay>susah</malay> [seh] I mean <malay>hari-hari takkan</malay> I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive [lah] of course some days <malay>kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke</malay> just feel all your emotions and then
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done [lah] of course but can be done it can be done ya
<malay>tak penat ke</malay> [eh] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay> no [lah] and also you complain
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> (mm) (mm)
true
standard [ah]
[ah] <malay>ni kalau ni</malay> singaporean <malay>kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>bukan</malay> singaporean [kan]
(mm) (mm)
I mean it's complaining is part of life [lah] you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
(mm) (mm) true very true
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> I mean there's good and bad [lah] I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely [kan] (uh) (uh)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask [lah] right I mean ya I mean singapore <malay>nak semua orang kena pakai</malay> mask
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see [eh]
<malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask
so like <malay>macam suka-suka</malay> [jer] then I like
[eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory [lah] for all but then I guess
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like (mm)
<malay>jaga diri baik-baik</malay> [lah] you know <malay>kalau pakai nak pakai</malay> up to you [lah] you know
(mm) (mm)
<malay>semua nak jadi</malay> famous [ah] <malay>semua tak ada kerja nak jadi</malay> famous [ah] so okay [lah] so <malay>dia orang tak nak pakai</malay> mask then like I guess
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>bukannya mahal ke</malay> the mask <malay>ada</malay> I think what less than one dollar you can get already
(uh) <malay>tu</malay> [lah]

what's the point to you
no I'm just looking at all these coming up and just setting reminders
you know right if you set reminder then they will (err) notify you on your phone or your whatsapp do you have that
[oh] then this is my account so that's why it's tied to my (err) phone
ya saying that okay so if when I put reminder right then they will just tell you like okay this is already up

<malay>dua hari</malay> [ah] so one day then <malay>lagi satu hari</malay> the actual shoot [ah]
ya but I don't know why they ask me okay (err) thursday you come for then friday come for the shoot then like
why not just one shot
because I remember right like
is very fast also
it's not like takes a long time
[oh]
maybe [ah]
[orh]
I mean that would make sense [lah] is earlier
[ah]
been awhile since I go there also [sia]
[eh] no [lah] last time I went was for
!wah! that [one] #shaggy#
ya
ya
no now is cause of COVID right so now they make the
they make it (err) you so (um) one week
push-up all that right the person is
(err) standing away
from you
like maybe
ya then they count [lor]
but then (err) cause of this right there's no contact thing right then
(err)
there's no gauge for you when to
(uh) push-up until
so they say just make sure your
elbow ninety
and something else I forget already
ya then so is easier [lah] but then
ya [sia] true
you got try at #maju# [ah]
[ah] #maju# the
#maju# is very the the machine
damn cock like <malay>susah untuk</malay>
use [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the what [ah] the
the track is actually shorter
like I don't know why but that day that day I like
screw up the the run [eh] the
the
(uh) statics because is all automatic
then I <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> [kan] so
<malay>macam</malay> new experience [ah] then
(err) when I use then I !wah!
why so hard then it always never detect
then like I needed like a ten ten to
ten ten to get silver minimum
then like !wah! I never run this fast before [sia]
even like our our trainee time right I think I run like ten ten thirty
ten thirty was my best
and that was like the most fit we ever been [sia]
then suddenly I run run run right like I didn't really care like tired or what then I run then suddenly ten O three then I like !wow!
ya I think adrian the one that told me the track is like very short
so like you won't you won't feel
it doesn't look like it [lah] but actually is
shorter I
think cause one thing is indoor
ya
so ya if you wanna like
if your statistics like not bad and then it's just your running right
then
you can consider #maju# [lah]
cause anyway very near like
you take one bus
[ah]
[ah] ya ya same same like #maju# [lah]
I mean
okay [lor]
sick wait with incentives is hundred right
I think with incentive is like <malay>seratus</malay> [eh]
<malay>seratus</malay> or <malay>dua ratus</malay> then
then silver is three hundred then the max is
the max is five hundred [lah] the gold

no action also #sian#
like at least you all get to experience stuff like you got to experience stuff

there was one [lah] but it's damn lame it's not like it's not like your kind of standard like go go deployed for anything is like
is this is the police day parade is it
(uh) I think then it was at
marina stadium there [ah] then what they did was what I had to do was (err)
I just accompany them on the boat

I was deployed as a medic but then there was
nothing to do

what's what's the then what's this like demons layer thing about [sia]
is it like is it like like attack on titan
ya ya ya
right
is like at the start right all the it really caught me cause
is like
super dynamic the way they
put the like animation style then I was like !wow! this is quite
but then now the story like I don't know what's going on already
but then they say the final season coming out soon
ya ya
why
how is this
but I haven't like
but like read any #manga# before [sia]

no as in as in what what what what what was it
now this
year still got what movie that's
marvel when you went there ya
I watch the new mutants not not that good [sia]
but that's
black panther [eh]
[ah] ya black widow I think
end of the year [ah]

the
the whole marvel scene
<malay>dari</malay> start <malay>sampai habis</malay>
so you <malay>tengok</malay> the infinity wars <malay>semua tu</malay>
who fuck [sia]
wait why did this even happen like
how did this even happen
[orh]
no
[orh]
but now what he doing [sia]
is it
[oh] ya
<malay>ayam penyet</malay> [oh] the one at science block [ah]
after
I see serious
[orh]
I mean maybe it's just like the institutions [lah]
that's what he don't have
ya [sia] that [one] !wah! that [one] #shiok# [eh]
but
coney island [ah]
is literally coney island group
okay [lah] then we got one more year you want you want
[eh] no no no touch wood touch wood
go up
three to four hours right
!huh! no [ah]
I mean
I that day try to keep up with you all also I want to <malay>pengsan</malay> already bro
you don't need to stand just
sit down and pedal
[oh] ya ya ya that's true I think one of my friends like
he he does this like
me and #hasif# got the gazelles team
the #hasif#
ya then we got the gazelles team then one of them now is like a fitness trainer then I think he does spin
class quite cool [eh] and
but sad [lah] like the club like
gone already like we stopped
stopped playing
but then I asked #imran# [lah] like if after
like all these phase whether like once
eleven eleven a side then maybe my team can
play against his team think would be quite fun [lah]
I miss playing football [sia]
why [sia]
[orh]
is the clutch game [ah]
well cause like approaching the end right I think
it was hard to find numbers [lah] then
then I think #hasif# just ask him
to fill in the numbers but then ya [lah] quite inconsiderate also seeing that like he come all the way down just for
five minutes but
maybe first second or third season second season we got like some good players but then
they all like very selfish with the ball so then <malay>tak</malay> pass
and it's just play amongst themselves and me [lah] so is like
unfair to others [lah] so I think they decided to leave
but that one #safi# #jio#
so then they stayed for long they were good [lah] but then ya just selfish [lor]
is that the start of this year ya ya the start of this year april march there
ya but I wanted to play [sia]
I sign up for captain ball
then I got the sport
because like I really wanted to play captain ball then (uh) I wanted to play the first year but then
it's either captain ball or
but then captain ball
I think there was too a lot of people then
not enough for football so I had to drop one then since
football not enough then I just join football
ya I was the keeper
clean sheet twice
first game concede second game clean sheet third game clean sheet
fourth game clean sheet
then final game
(err) think final game I think concede one
but the goal was damn stupid like
like the guy kick not even hard
but then it bounce bounce bounce right then I dived then it bounced over my hand
then go in then !wah! I tilted
I have no clue I think I think the way he hit the
ball not a clean strike
but then it was like
so it hit the ground then it bounce then it bounce then
I misjudged [lor]
but by then they all would have played at right
!wah! #shiok# [sia] !wah! #shiok#
that's why I was like hope really hoping like
hopefully the COVID won't get in the way
then at least
we get to play one more time [lah] before before like
before
year two okay [lah] year two was fun [lah]
you have to travel with caleb they all
actually I was quite lucky [lah] they get to travel that [one]
ya not bad [ah]
(err) <malay>bulan</malay>
<malay>bulan tujuh</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas</malay>
exam so <malay>kita kat sana untuk</malay>
ya ya
so <malay>kat sana untuk</malay>
<malay>satu minggu</malay> [ah] ya so I mean school [lah] so
#bo# #pian# [lah] so it's just like
you just go there then you learn about their healthcare system
<malay>pastu pergi mana</malay>
(err) some of the hospital [lah] <malay>kat sana</malay>
get to know like they are how their
how the hospital works actually they all I was surprised [sia] like their
they quite
not say backwards [lah] but not as up to date as like singapore's kind of
like technology like their technologies still
quite old [lah]
ya maybe ya cause that [one] was up a mountain [leh]
but it was quite cool [lah] then
try #soba# then the
(err) we learn about
their stroke management actually their stroke patients like I think it's a japanese thing to be like super positive even though you are like phase three
those kind of adversity
ya so it was quite an eye opening experience
then like this year this year never go #dublin# right
so actually going that japan thing was quite good [lah] so at least some of the mods cleared
you all also supposed to have trips right
taiwan [ah]
korea
korea
but is just one week though
ya ya ya [ah]
cause like
I see the price right then like
for one week is it really worth it like I feel you can go
can go on a holiday for one week
at that same place with like lesser expenditure [oh] ya that is true
ya [sia] ya [sia]
how you got learn [ah]
what you learn
no no as in as in what you what recipe you ya
macarons
isn't that like super sweet or something
the capsule [ah]
[orh]
!wah! sounds tough [sia]
I do (err) during the circuit breaker at what they are
I mainly bake cake also #pandan# cake
(err) what other cake
(err) was it
butter
honey pound [ah] ya but then like
and all my like asked me like [eh] why you suddenly like start baking then like I got bored [ah]
but all the baking was just like just to relieve stress [lor] cause I think that period was also like exam period
then like !wah! I just want to take my mind off it [lah] so <malay>buat kek</malay> [ah]
ya then
ya [lor] that was like circuit breaker in a in a nutshell [lah]
it was just like at home doing nothing
actually it was quite therapeutic [lah] having that like time to myself also
[oh] ya that's true [lah] that's why a lot of people like
they did all the exercise stuff and all that then put on
story ya ya that was like the hype [leh]
you me no you did
[oh] ya ya chloe kept on trying [lah] I think #dekai# also kept on trying
[oh] ya [lah]
neighbours
actually mac and cheese I don't know why [sia]
because there was that time when (err)
my parents were overseas in new zealand right then like I had to
I had to cook myself [lah] for that one whole week
then I go cook mac and cheese thinking like it's gonna be damn easy then I
I don't know how I screw it up [sia] then I eat right I can still the taste the flour [eh]
ya maybe [ah] probably probably
!wah! but that one whole week was quite
#shiok# [ah] having the whole house to myself
which was the best
what was the best recipe like
whether is solid
actually is like the recipe and the ingredients like all so simple but then when you actually get down to it right !wah! is actually
ya
but the
[ah] ya you use what
(mmhmm)
mean
I think I use parmesan parmesan cheese
I think it was not bad
but I also use it to make this pasta recently
I think I made with #fifi#
then like he teach me how to like
make make what's this thing called
make (err) the mushroom more meaty [ah]
so like he when he cook the mushroom like he grill not grill [ah]
he pan fry the mushroom but he put like he put like (err)
butter on the pan first
then after that he put the mushroom
then he let it sizzle for awhile then he put salt
because the salt will like take out the
(err) take the moisture out
draw the moisture out cause when it's frozen right a lot of it is trapped inside [mah]
then after that he will
he will take
[oh] what he do after that [ah] [oh] ya then he will take
(err) like this
thing to <malay>kemek-kemek</malay> [kan] [ah] like press press

okay I hope [sial] I hope it's alright
ya it's like that [lah]
(um)
okay then
why what did she say
is it really a is it really even even a break up
ya [lah] because honestly he like how to say say (uh) he says like back then like [oh] we're not together you know like we're just friends
but they act like they are together but the whole point of a relationship is the act [lah] not the just the label so basically he he was together actually because he like spend all the time with her
like they eat together then hang out together it's basically like dating [lah] even though he doesn't want to say that it's dating but the fact that it actually is what it is isn't even if he denies the the label and doesn't want to put the name on it
it is what it is you know
to what
when when was this
they will just they will just we'll we'll you and me will be third and fourth wheels [eh] no the thing is right they say they say they are not dating but they totally act like they are dating remember they do all those cringey things in front of us
!haiya! you know I don't know [lah]
like you know when when friends in like when two people in your friend group go date each other then they break up that just sucks [lah] it's like
it's just annoying I think it's just like why you all got to date each other can you just find somebody else outside your friend group
but that's what I want I think like if I want to find I'll just find someone out of my friend group cause like it's so annoying right like there's some some like friend groups will fracture because of a break up of relationship inside their friend group
shut up [lah] to shut up okay
shut up [lah]

(uh) you know
what do you mean
no adela wants to meet us because she just broke up
she has but I (uh) I don't know I think she wants a guy guy's opinion I don't know
what is against her
cause she's cause she's being stupid that's why
it's not it's not the fact no I feel like it's just it's not her it's not just like girls it's it's her okay
it's like
she does okay she has a lot of problems
!wow!
the [ah] I already told you [what] that time feel a bit lazy to say
no like she has such a
she has such she's such a bad unhealthy view on relationships
like she so she's so disgusting how she treats she expects a guy her boyfriend to treat her like she she like keep saying like [oh] I I want a boyfriend so that he can buy me free food
[eh] you know all these all these movement by girls like all men are trash all men are trash kill all men you know what girls are actually trash also
no [ah] you're not [lah]
that's why I don't say all girls are trash [ah] like the the the the the phrase
but you know girls are equally trash also like I when I hear adela talk about how what her what her ideal guy is like damn disgusting [sial]
like she keep saying about
(um) she keep telling telling us like [oh] I want a boyfriend so he can buy me free food like so she can buy he can buy for me (err) clothes and I can take his clothes
it's like it's so materialistic and it's so like you know like she's like using the guy to spend on her
I think she's (um)
teachers and I think she's a middle class like okay
as a student in singapore you're basically poor that's what you are but she lives in a maisonette
and her father drives audi A five I think
ya but
I but you know that's the thing like okay your parents may be rich but you are not rich you know what I mean
unless like your they constantly give you money and like
ya that's still their parents money like once you're
like once you're how to say you want to marry or something or you move out the house
like are they really going to keep giving you money
she's stable [lah]
because she has that's exactly that's what I'm saying we keep saying men are trash girls are also trash okay
exactly and then that's what girls always say no [lah] (uh) when the girl's the exception they say (uh) no [lah] she's just the exception exception like
like [eh] enough
black lives matter
no she's not
no she too dense to think about it
sometimes no [lah] she doesn't
shut up
okay she's not attitude problem but she's just very bimbo to associates
and and then it's okay when back in secondary school when you're still a very young girl
but now that you are twenty two or twenty one is become has become very
like
just grow up you know what I mean like
you're supposed to be like matured already and
think about other people and like not have this kind of views but she's the same old adela from secondary school
(uh) it's just I think it's just
mostly down to herself
because if you you can't blame your your your your ex for
behaving a certain way also [what] like the only reason why you don't develop because you don't want to
mature yourself and like grow up you know I mean
how I know tinder instagram I don't know

when there are free like if you tell me a date like you know how how like if I if I suggest something then let's say like
everybody say okay then the one person who didn't reply suddenly say [oh] I cannot on this day then why you never tell me in the first place
you don't tell me <malay>apa-apa</malay> you know don't tell me that you go and tell me what date you can what date you cannot

whatever it is I'll just try
[oh] I might not you know I'll just like
basically what I'm saying right now is also just to fill up the
right whatever I'm saying right now is just to fill up the conversation so so sometimes I'll just say bullshit but you know it's not actually
just trying to fill up the the one hour
why does it feel why does it feel so much harder to like talk about
ya
or we can sing another thing we can sing okay [lah] sing [oh] no it's not singlish [what] if we sing
we are
okay then
are you kidding me

[oh] my god dude I will go with #faz# and you
and #afiq# okay forget about #amar# okay if #amar# don't want to go
why
what
but he's been working so much
this is just one time and it's not even that expensive dude
no but the the thing is if he wants to rent that that tricycle thing it's way more expensive than renting a bike you know so it makes no sense
a double bike is way more expensive than a single bike okay it's not even like because it's double bike it's two times it's not
okay you can just ride on your own so I don't think that's the case
and and also and also
also he

so what it just doesn't add up
are they all adult size
where is her bike where she live
how we supposed to bring #jurong# #jurong# west bikes all five of them to

I don't know member of parliament general election
was it I don't know I anyhow only
I don't know what's that
ya I'm not sure I'm in a group yet
mine mine when I message the person she said
(uh) I'll be added to the group
on
monday
I think
I'm not sure
maybe
but I already got my location
ya
[oh] I got my dates on eighth and and eighth of july and eleventh
ya you got what
you got nine and ten [ah]
wait isn't voting day just one day
I don't know actually
pioneer some people will vote on the ninth and tenth
so what do they do I if I setup on the eighth who's going to setup what on ninth
that's election officials that's that's not us we are doing setting up only
by because I know because my sister is
(err) election my sister-in-law is a election official
that means she'll be probably be there manning the polling booths [lah] the voting booths
ya she told me cause she she she also does the
does the she does the safety distancing ambassador thing like she goes around
like hawker centres making sure people practise safe social distancing
[eh] hello
of course [lah]
(err) no
I don't know got
if you go hawker centres they have as in like in groups of five cannot mix with another group of five okay for example
because got no safety distancing ambassadors there and everybody's an idiot
ya exactly they say groups of five go out then after that they go more than group of five groups of five they get corona then
serves them right
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] no [lah] okay [lah] no I just kidding [ah] but then like they already say [what] groups of five maximum but then they want to go break those rules
is it
I think ya the last five minutes right we try to speak malay
cause I scared got not enough malay
it's now forty nine thirty three for me what's yours
forty nine forty now
okay same
[eh] I feel really good about liverpool [ah] about man city beating liverpool
cause liverpool suck [ah]
they won already they won already
but man city beat them yesterday
no it's just a
no it's they won the the match
you understand but they didn't win the league
no okay a league how you win the league how you win the league
is that
you will
there's like thirty plus teams in the league right
so
you have your home and away matches
so basically (uh) you will fight every team at home so means your stadium and then you will go to their stadium and fight them again
so a win means three points
you your team earns three points
a draw means one point
and a lost is zero points
so basically
you have like sixty plus matches
in the league right
because it's just thirty times two [what]
so
you try to
collect the most points
(err) then the most points win [lah] win the league
so it reaches a point where hello
okay so they it liverpool reached the point in the
in the season where they
where they mathematically (uh) mathematically no other team can beat them on points
so that means they reached high enough far enough that
even if the second place team wins all the the rest of their remaining matches their points their point tally cannot go above
liverpool's
(err) point tally
so that's why they won the league
ya so they they want to win the league early [lah] so so to speak
it's it's fair [lah] as in like they were good that means they won it already that means they were they were good [lah]
ya it's fair
no how is that not fair how is that not fair
it's fair
ya
but so so liverpool already won the league
and then
(err) but you still have the remaining matches [what]
to be played
to be played
you cannot cut the league short because
even though first place has been decided second third fourth fifth sixth all the way to thirty has not been decided
[eh] wait I'm not sure how many teams there are I think is twenty four [oh] my god not thirty [ah] forget [ah] forget how many matches there are but you get what I mean
so [oh] my god wait it's not even thirty I think it's like sixteen or eighteen
can't be that many teams in a league
okay wait I think it's like
nineteen teams [ah] or some or forty or twenty teams [ah] twenty plus teams [lah] not thirty plus
so is twenty plus teams okay so
it was like so like you cannot stop the league at when the first place when the first place has been decided [what]
cause you need to find out who can come second third fourth fifth all the way to twenty plus all the way to the last right
and then the the three last teams will get relegated
they go down a league
they go to a lower division league
it means you don't compete in the premier league anymore
and then
the one in the lower division league their top
three
if I'm not wrong top three their top top three teams will go up to premier league
ya
so
that's how a season works
how's it so hard to understand
okay (uh) right now it's like fifty four

and this is #wafaidil#
pretty good you know and it's (uh) it's been an eventful weekend I've been spending a lot of family bonding time with my family (uh) spending I just spend today at the beach in #sentosa# and
and cause we had a lot of free time and considering it's gonna be another stressful week of work or study (err) this coming week
we just wanted to spend this last day of the weekend you know just playing around the sand throwing each other into the sea spending quality family time
what about you #hady# what have you done for this weekend
(um) personally I wouldn't say that it's insignificant [lah] I'm just gonna say that
there's a little room to improve cause as of now
unless innovation is kicked in and newer ways are produced
we can't really get any better cause it's already it already seemed flawless [ah]
and now it's just depends on like what are the different types of features being added to the newer phones and how important are these features and how frequent are they being used in our daily lives how does it improve the quality of life I would say that is one criteria that big brands such as apple should instill [lah] looking for newer features that can improve the daily quality of their customers
(um) one question I would like to ask you would be
do you think a phone should cost around
a thousand cause the new iphones I've seen when walking past those apple stores
were actually around a thousand [ah] for the iphone eleven max pro what do you think of the price tag and do you think it's worth it
(um) in terms of the mask in this hot weather we can't really do anything to
minimise its effect on us [ah] cause we always have to ensure that we have our mask on on public transport in our offices when we conversing with our perhaps colleagues and friends and
there's no way around it [ah] it's always (err) prioritizing our own safety over such comforts like [ah] fighting off against the heat [ah] and but what I would suggest
for you to keep up with this heat is to always drink a lot of water
<malay>minumlah banyak air</malay>
so <malay>bila kita dah peluh</malay>
[ah] more water is put in ourselves and we will <malay>kita akan rasa</malay> hydrated [lah]
okay my
(um) me personally I've been living with having to wear spectacles ever since I was a kid [lah] and
me as being someone very (err)
very (err)
I would say
fair on what I spend my money on
I feel that spectacles should be free [ah] cause I didn't ask to be born with (err) bad eyesight and
this is some this is a necessity to ask to contribute to the workforce so I think that it should be free for us to
you know see properly do better jobs at what we do
and yeah
that is something I could agree on [ah] for you know countries like switzerland providing [eh] countries like sweden sorry
countries like sweden providing free healthcare for their (um) their people and hopefully one day countries like singapore can also (err) adopt that (err) value of (err) taking care of their people's health [lah]
and providing certain free services for like I would say certain be better cause
(err) we do not we don't want to put our country in debt cause of the supplies needed for this medical you know and
I would like to ask you another question #hady# (um)
it may be seem out of context but (um) if you could have one superpower what would it be
(mm) after much consideration of like
[ah] me personally being someone who cares about my self image and what other think about me
I think I'd go with mind reading you know cause
is like you know whenever you go through your festive seasons you do your house visiting I just want to read the minds of the aunties inside the household and just like
think [ah] do they have a good image of me do they secretly have a secret hatred towards me cause I eat too much at their house
ya then you know it's a certain sentimental reasons just to
I just want I just want to read how people think about me and like
what they go through in life
how much better of a person I can cheat I can be towards them
to stop treating them badly understand their situation deeper detail cause I'll be reading their mind [lah] through through their eyes [lah] basically seeing their lives through their eyes
and you know that mind reading ability might come to might be useful for me during like exams cause sometimes you know you run run you run into hard [eh] hard questions which
you kind of overlooked when you were studying and you didn't know how to do so
why not mind read the smartest student who is just a few chairs away from you right
and get that higher mark [ah] and hopefully and through that
enter good uni you know
(err) back to you #hady#
[ah] and you can also read the minds of all the <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> what they are talking about between each other
you can just listen from afar right
(hmm)
ya yes of course you know (err)
throughout the our daily life you always think about a bit sometimes weird stuff that just passes by our mind and we don't want to (err) give off a wrong image to the person reading our mind [lah] cause
we show what we want to show to people we don't want to show them what we don't want to show
cause we know it's not right but it's still being processed in our brain so ya [lah]
<malay>nanti tak baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau orang tengok kita macam</malay> (err) <malay>orang jahat tapi padahal kita biasa-biasa</malay> [jer]
[ah]
(hmm) <malay>kalau aku</malay> I feel that
I <malay>aku akan belajar</malay> (err) what what's that photo photo memory
where you see something once
<malay>abeh terus boleh ingat</malay>
(um) this is useful cause when you're studying and you have to flip through so many pages from your textbook
and having this photo memory you can instantly pick it up
so as you as you're when you're doing your exam
this image will straightaway just pop up in your brain and you can copy word for word giving them the model answer
the second skill I would have to say would be (hmm) I've always been a big fan of gordon ramsay so probably cooking [ah] cause
(err) food is like such a wonder to this work there's so much unique taste there so much unique
(err) ingredients to be explored
ya unique fusions so me myself being able to learn how to cook really like
drives me [lah] to try out different things different you know different cuisines and learn them cook them in my [ah]
at at my convenience with my own mix ya
as for the third skill I would say right
is
being able to
make friends with anyone
(err) I feel that being social is quite important in my life cause like
(err)
I'm (err) I always have to interact with people in school in work
in in my own household (err) and (um)
somewhat lacking in the social department [lah] cause
(err) it always seem like I just don't mix well with people and
(err)
we just (uh) interested in different things [lah]
so that's just me and my (err) life relations [lah]
(err) <malay>masing-masing ada masalah sendiri</malay> [kan]
you know
for as for you #hady# <malay>kalau kau boleh</malay> master <malay>tiga benda</malay>
master <malay>apa</malay>
(hmm) me being a mobile phone kind of person whenever I do turn on the to watch
it would have to be either action
or stuff that is animated [lah] cause the movies like with actions or animations
are deeper appreciated if you view them on the bigger screen cause you view details that you would miss out on a small frame of a phone so with this big frame you notice every single detail every single [ah] intricate detail of like
explosions (um) (err) hidden features like like
somewhat of sudden appearance
(um) if
my favourite action movie would have to be the expendables [ah] cause
(err)
nearly all my favourite actors [ah] actors and actresses are in there my idol
<malay>abang sado</malay> arnold schwarzenegger
(err) there's also
(err) people like
(err) rocky [ah]
(um) not really him but (err) the actor for rocky [ah] <malay>yang dia naik tangga tinggi itu</malay>
[ah] he's always I've I recalled seeing him when whenever I was a child my parents would play his movie [ah]
ya I totally agree with you on your last point but I also
I would like to disagree with you about the romance [ah]
for me personally I feel that romance plots are always the same it's always the hero save the damsel
and then they just fall in love and get a happy ending
which is always being overplayed overplayed overplayed cause people want that idealistic ending and I feel like movie movie director should make a more
(um) diverse type of ending for example one of the lovers dies coming to the ending or like
[ah] the lover finds another lover you know to create different emotions [lah] of
in a love [lah]
(hmm) <malay>kalau aku</malay> [eh] <malay>nak jadi</malay> actor
honestly I would always go for my celebrity crush [ah]
mister johnny depp he has a very (err) mysterious unpredictable vibe towards him with his smoldering looks
you know he he just a hottie [ah] I would say
(err) but recently I've been hearing that he's been abused
by his (err) former wife [eh] [ah] by amber heard
it's kind of sad [lah] I just wish him the best [ah]
you
(hmm) so you're telling me you would rather be ryan gosling over johnny depp
who in the past has know been known for
you know dating a lot of beautiful girls over
this newcomer ryan gosling
or perhaps (oo) because of sentimental reasons you say cause he relates to you
similar [ah] I relate to (um) my johnny depp cause you know
well
<malay>kita dua-dua</malay> handsome you know and can relate
on that note
I can agree with you cause I've always been scared of ants and as you know ants always come in pax
and that has always been one of my fears growing up or being bitten by multiple ants so
when you say a hundred otter sized horses
an otter is not that small but that would be scary cause I would be overwhelmed whereas if I had to fight an
horse sized otter
I mean a horse is pretty big but
it's not an like an elephant big
so
ya I think I can I could somewhat stand a chance more more
to the
compared to the small otters [ah] [eh] small horses [ah]
knowing me right
I think that
if I were to put stuff inside time capsule
it would be
green tea [ah]
cause I've been drinking that ever since primary school [ah]
and then such a you know a singaporean drink
every single day auntie
one green tea [ah] and it's always so cheap you know it's like one one twenty one ten
ya and [ah] another item I would say is probably
(hmm)
probably a note to myself from the past (err) you know [lah]
when you're in the future you're in the past
you always want to know [lah] like what's your future self
would I be more <malay>gemuk</malay>
would I be <malay>lagi tinggi</malay> would I be (err) <malay>lagi kaya</malay>
(err) you you always want to ask yourself how you're doing [ah] basically a reality check from the past [ah]
and the third item I would put in there would be something that could last long
or gain in value like perhaps
my young self could persuade <malay>bapa</malay>
for his rolex you know
put it in a time capsule you know so for fifteen years for example
it has not been touched that rolex has been inside that box
who knows what the value could be by then you know it might be more it might be less but hopefully it would be more [lah] cause
<malay>lagi kaya</malay> [lah]
[ah] as for you #hady# what would you put inside
you could say we have
you could say we have pretty similar taste [ah] putting a note together
take [ah]
you want me [ah] one what do you have another question you would like to ask me
if if I had three wishes [ah]
honestly
me being me
I probably wish for a hundred billion dollars [ah] people say money can't buy happiness
but not for me [ah]
I could sponsor my parents trips to their <malay>haji</malay> every single year
how does that not make you happy
and I could also own
(um) like big houses by the ocean
and give them one to each of my siblings
for their families
so
I don't see why money can't buy happiness you know
these sentimental reasons are like
these big purchases can like improve our quality of life so
deeper appreciation for each other you know
as for the second wish right
[ah] I would honestly
wish for an air conditioned shirt
so that when cause singapore's weather is so hot nowadays
literally the moment you step out
you start sweating
so an air conditioned shirt
would be so useful in our day and time [ah]
of course (err)
you just keep your whole body cold you'll be more energetic
(err) ya you can just run about your day without having to be drenched in sweat having to worry about smelling bad
you know
quite a useful item to wish for to be honest
and as for my third wish I would
probably ask for
for me to hold my own concert [lah]
(um) me being me I've heard myself sing in the toilet a few times and
you could say I can hit them notes [ah] and
(uh) I've always idolized this K pop stars ever since I was young so I inspired to have my own concert with
people rushing over to see me perform
so ya those are pretty much
the three things [ah] that
I would wish for [ah]
okay
that's me with me that's me with the questions done how about you #hady#
what would you wish for
(um) those are very good wishes [ah] your first wish makes me (err) seems like a very stingy person and selfish [ah] cause
you'd wish for people to gain an access to an unlimited amount of money right
and whereas I prioritize myself [ah]
and as for your second wish I
really hope you could amend that [ah] cause who would want to be the owner of such a
buy in team and with no history
so no point supporting and being an owner of a team that has no backbone [ah] so if you could
I would suggest you (err) be the owner of liverpool instead [ah]
fair enough [ah]
[oh] that is very easy
that is very easy
for me
personally
I will eat #nasi lemak#
cause
(uh) actually no I will take back my I will take back my answer
actually <malay>kalau aku boleh makan satu satu benda untuk</malay>
the remainder of my life [ah]
probably #nasi ayam penyet# [ah]
it literally has all components I need [ah]
it has vegetables you know sometimes they put cabbage under the
fried chicken
they always give like slices of potatoes
[ah] there's always cucumber which is good
(err) of course [lah] the primary part [ah]
of course [lah] the
(um) primary part
of the dish of #nasi ayam penyet# which is the fried chicken
which is a great source of protein you know
and
and always a small kick of spice with the <malay>sambal belacan</malay> that is always given so ya I would say that's a pretty
pretty balanced meal for me to continue being happy and with my body [ah]
ya
so
if I could eat one dish
so #hady# if you could eat one dish what will you eat
(hmm)
quite quite a good reason sentimental I've went for the well balanced route you've went to
your mum's cooking which is
what what we eat daily
day to day like right now but
okay I would like to ask you one question
if you could
what is your ideal job
that you wish you be doing in the future
ya you can choose any job you want
(um) <malay>kalau aku</malay> [kan]
I would want to be a
(err) I would want to run my own radio like (um)
have you heard of the malay podcast called
okay let's go
yes that's something that I have
really been look look up to [lah] cause these three guys are
literally talking about the issues in singapore
without restrictions
they literally just
talk without boundaries cause
they have no limitations they speak on real problems
highlighting what
highlighting ya highlighting the problems
what could be done to (um)
(err) prevent such things from happening again
and they just a wonderful bunch [ah] they very humorous
and
considering they are three <malay>abang melayu</malay>
that [ah] that just quit their nine to five jobs and just
[ah] started a podcast which became singapore number one podcast is just
!wow!
if only I could do that with two other people
with someone budgeting us
<malay>aku</malay> guarantee you we would be a number one radio
(um) another job that I would be
probably the law law sector [ah]
<malay>daripada kecil</malay> I've
<malay>aku nak jadi macam</malay> lawyer <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> you know <malay>tolong orang</malay> [ah]
(err)
giving people that deserve judgement
the fair judgment [ah]
for example <malay>kalau orang dia jahat</malay>
that give him the proper (um)
punishment
I don't want I don't want to be a lawyer <malay>macam</malay>
they can be bought off [ah]
(err) you know there's always speculations that
judges are very biased nowadays for like
the cases
you know
just cause they have a four point O
they get excused from molestation
record people showering like
does that even makes sense [ah]
just cause they have a potential bright future
they can do all these nonsense I don't think so
<malay>gini semua merepek</malay> [ah]
then
ya I would try to be I would try to prioritize [lah]
justice [ah] over anything
and for my third job [ah]
honestly I would want something social [lah]
so perhaps
(err)
a singaporean tour guide
I've always been you know
pretty excited on meeting new walks of life in singapore
and you know just conversing
knowing what they like about singapore what they don't like
we have to know [lah] cause we we be pretty egoistic if we don't
want to know what they don't like us
maybe we can improve from there
and you know we can learn what unique about singapore
and in
meeting new people has always been a
(err) (err) a hobby of mine which I like [ah] cause you know
you have more friends
you learn more cause you're you've open up to more people
and different people act differently [ah] so
you would probably learn you know how
how people act
and adjust yourself accordingly [lah] if the people #macam#
<malay>kalau orang itu perangai jahat</malay>
you can learn
how to deal
<malay>dengan orang yang perangai tak baik</malay> in the future
<malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
back to you #hady#
<malay>kalau aku</malay> [kan]
(hmm)
for me personally
from what I've seen [ah]
I feel like <malay>badan sapau</malay>
<malay>lagi penting daripada kelihatan</malay>
[eh]
sorry sorry sorry I would like to take that back
I would like to say that good looks are more important than a fit body [ah] cause
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls cause I malay
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls fall for guys simply for their looks
they could be as skinny as a board
and they would get
<malay>semua perempuan melayu</malay>
you know
(um)
(um)
good looks over that one [ah]
cause they also keep in mind that they want
<malay>dia orang nak</malay> baby <malay>yang macam</malay> you know <malay>yang</malay> cute cute
they want to have like a good face so that
you don't get bored of them [ah] easily
apart from their good personality
there's also the complimentary of a good face
[ah] <malay>itulah yang</malay>
from what I ask my female friends [lah] female <malay>melayu</malay> friends
that's what they say [ah] how about you #hady# what you think
<malay>setuju</malay> [ah] <malay>setuju</malay>
there there's no point if you have good looks
<malay>tapi perangai macam</malay>
<malay>tak bagus</malay> [ah] simply said [ah] for what for what he looks good
but <malay>dia kurang ajar dengan kau dia tak jaga hati kau</malay> what's the point of all these if cannot that's why ya ya personally
out of the two options I would if only I could slot in the choice of personality (oo) then that's what I would choose [lah] primarily ya stick to good looks [lah]
okay (err) passing back to me I would like to ask you a question
why do you think the number one leading death cause for young people in singapore is suicide
why do you think so
(um) personally <malay>aku setuju dengan</malay> your opinion that <malay>hidup kita semua</malay> (err) is moving in a very fast pace [ah] and you all happening
it's all happening very fast and sometimes we don't have the time to like to comprehend and adjust to it [ah] so ya all these build up pressure would be
kind [ah] (um) kind [ah] does a heavy toll on us [ah]
ya and it's it's sad to say that personally I feel that in asian household
(err) mental health <malay>ini memang</malay> overlooked at [ah]
they just avoided [ah] like what you said it's like a taboo in our household
it is it is rarely talk about cause ya when our parents were growing up
they never really consider themselves they always thought of the consequences for example so what if their jobs were stressful
is better than being jobless
ya that's what they always thought but [ah] in this newer generation is good <malay>yang</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita semakin</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (err) making it more of a
(err) raising awareness [lah] I would say (err) to this type of issue [ah] back to you #hady#
[oh]
(hmm) ya I agree with your statement
this that that change must be must happen we have to strive for more supportive family it's about supportive background you know
ya (err) okay time to turn (err) time to turn to happier pastures [ah] from this depressing (err) fix (err)
what would like to ask you right
about some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
ya
(um)
as a singaporean something that I can be proud of and appreciative is
our public transport [lah]
I would say we have the best public transport cause
our buses nowadays are very clean very fast and
with the introduction of (err) electrical buses
very green [ah]
I would say we've been making an effort to reduce carbon monoxide (err) you know
to play our part in keeping singapore green country
and ya something that I'm proud of being singaporean is I think an effective and also green public transport
yes of course #hady# we talked about certain questions and
getting our opinions on certain issues I feel like this talk was very good [ah] productive <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
<malay>terima kasih</malay> bye bye

so hello I'm I'm went from the toilet [ah] sorry [ah] for the wait
so like

okay [lah] ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy <malay>macam</malay> chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap [sia]
so one is for one dollar
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like <malay>macam</malay> you go to #jinjja# chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or [ah] it's that one [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like <malay>macam</malay> got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone [lah] got a lot of different flavour [ah] like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
we never go at there maybe we can go there [lor] check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces !wah! #shiok# [sia]
actually we can two person share one [what] one person six piece six dollars okay [sia] right
ya so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather #sedap# mania [ah] #sedap# mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right <malay>kalau</malay> colour <malay>hijau</malay> then this price <malay>kalau</malay>

<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>mata tutup</malay> [ah] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> B B nine
(err) <malay>bukan bukan bukan</malay>
ya <malay>bukan</malay>
so okay <malay>kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni</malay> [eh] <malay>mari kita</malay>
[ah] <malay>nak cakap pasal orang tak</malay>
<malay>nak cakap tentang apa</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh gitu</malay> [eh]
<malay>orang kasih</malay> assignment <malay>kita mengumpat</malay>
okay okay ya alright <malay>kita jadi</malay> serious (um) <malay>apa kita nak berbual</malay> [eh] (um)
<malay>kita boleh cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita punya keluarga</malay> or okay no [lah] no [lah] [ah] shares [lah] stock market [lah] [eh]
so (um) you <malay>ada</malay> any investment you you <malay>dah buat ke</malay> or anything you <malay>nak</malay> recommend
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
me ya
I I also don't know [lah] I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
but I <malay>tak tahu</malay> because <malay>sekarang nak beli</malay> tesla <malay>mahal tak mampu</malay> though
so
I think <malay>kalau</malay> I I will <malay>beli</malay> the stock (uh) for what I have now [lah] my capital <malay>yang ada</malay> I would probably invest in cheaper stocks [lah] singapore based stocks like
(uh) old #chang kee# for example (err) <malay>murah</malay> [jer] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> old #chang kee# <malay>dia punya</malay> share price is (err) <malay>enam puluh satu sen saje</malay> [tau] [ah] serious [a'ah] <malay>betul tu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada macam seratus ke dua ratus</malay> dollar then you <malay>akan</malay>
hold a lot of shares [tau] so I think
<malay>berbaloi</malay> [lah] then I I I mean [ah] I was looking at their annual report then old #chang kee# [kan]
<malay>dia orang akan</malay> open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like <malay>macam</malay> the demand for asian foods are rising <malay>tapi</malay> supply <malay>tak banyak</malay>
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region [kan] then <malay>agaknya</malay> I would think [lah] it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like (um) they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend [lah] so I mean that's my thing [lah] cause <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't think I I <malay>boleh mampu</malay> [lah] tesla <malay>mahal saje</malay>
ya <malay>tapi itu</malay> my thing [lah] on stocks
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> some some stocks <malay>dia orang tak</malay> how to say <malay>dia orang tak syariah</malay> on client [tau] so <malay>nanti dia orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh ambil dia punya</malay> (um) benefits [lah] from that stocks so ya I don't know [lah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua</malay> islamic financial [ah] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it [lah] that time I went for this (uh) website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get <malay>syariah pampasan</malay> or not
so it's very interesting because <malay>macam</malay> they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's (uh) allowed or not <malay>haram</malay> or halal [lah] in that sense <malay>tapi</malay> the problem with that website [ah] they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you <malay>kena bayar</malay>
then I'm like !alamak! then you muslim <malay>pun nak buat duit</malay>
<malay>nak tengok</malay> stocks halal <malay>ke tak</malay>
but I would say it's good [lah] like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very <malay>macam</malay> you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay [lah] that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
ya I think <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>kita sekarang</malay> (err) I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive [lah]
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
so ya <malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay>
ya (um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
good <malay>tak</malay> stocks
(mm)
I see I see
ya anyway (err) <malay>betul tu</malay> ya but I heard [kan] <malay>itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak pakai wahed</malay> invest then
<malay>ada</malay> some fees involved right like <malay>apa tu</malay>
but how much [ah] the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
(mm)
ya ya
(um) okay <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nak bilang</malay> you [oh] ya anyway I I found out there is days
new (um) way
technically grow your money but with very low return [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you <malay>tak nak letak</malay> it in the bank [lah]
because firstly <malay>kalau</malay> you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the <malay>hibah tak banyak</malay>
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new <malay>saham</malay> returns <malay>tapi tak banyak</malay> the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> it's like a savings account with a little bit more (uh)
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
so
wasted [lah] I think like a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal
so
ya [lah] wasted <malay>kalau dia orang tak</malay> invest in bonds then <malay>kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam</malay> [seh] if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
right [kan]
can [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> I call <malay>dia orang</malay>
ya [lah] I call [lah] I call [lah] I <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay> right
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity [lah] because like you know (um)
[eh] not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward [lah] for
for the idea of islamic finance because technically (um) you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also <malay>macam</malay> in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
that's why I think (err)
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore <malay>macam</malay> not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
ya possibly because (um) even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
interest yielding accounts and maybe <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> [lah] it's <malay>haram</malay> because you would need to kind of know [mah] <malay>yang kita tak boleh yang</malay> interest and all bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya <malay>kita terus</malay> deep [eh] <malay>berbual</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> I was looking at (um) the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting [lah] because (uh) one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are (err) they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
(um) maybe there's one thing we can consider [lah]
so ya
SOCOE will be a good <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>pun macam tak faham sangat</malay> [lah] how how the SOCOE (um) investment works but halal [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] so <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [eh]
ya so
ya
[oh] <malay>kita punya</malay> trip [eh] [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I I <malay>punya adik kejap</malay> [eh] I call my <malay>adik</malay> hello
<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>baru kentut adik</malay> I <malay>kentut adik</malay> I <malay>lepas ni nak kena</malay>
<malay>bau dia kuat</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu dia punya ada</malay> like a mix of a and I don't know <malay>dia makan apa tapi bau dia</malay> like one kind you know toxic toxic
<malay>kentut</malay> [ah] I think maybe yes [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> eating [lah] agaknya rasa gitu</malay> [ah]
so (um)
ya ya <malay>itu</malay> I I I <malay>tu tak</malay> okay [ha] [ha] so anyway (um)
<malay>nak pergi makan</malay> I <malay>pun lapar sekarang belum makan</malay> so I <malay>pun nak pergi makan</malay> actually [kan] is #hafizah# going or not to #sedap# mania like what what do you think the chances are

!aiyo! unless <malay>kita</malay> just go somewhere to like <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
then after that we just <malay>lepak</malay> then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
I would think maybe #seletar# cafe will be good <malay>tapi sana makanan dia</malay> <malay>tak</malay> halal so <malay>mana kita boleh makan</malay> [oh] maybe we can eat at #seletar# airport the mister <malay>teh tarik</malay> express <malay>dia tu mahal ke</malay>
okay (um)
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> what are good things for us to <malay>makan</malay> [eh] (err)

<malay>nak</malay> find ideas [lah] want to like the social mission
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> so in singapore <malay>apa</malay> social mission you can solve
<malay>mana</malay> #boon keng# is it
at this block block block <malay>sebelas</malay> [eh]
<malay>ada yang sebelah</malay> main road <malay>tu yang</malay> you pass by <malay>satu</malay> block <malay>macam</malay> horizontal
[ah] block block <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak</malay> [eh] block <malay>tu ada dadah semua</malay> I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
I don't know [lah]
[oh] [oh] your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
[oh] distant [eh] <malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
[oh] okay okay
[oh]
<malay>nama dia</malay> Q
ya so <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>tahu ni</malay> Q <malay>tinggal kat</malay> #boon keng#
[oh]
<malay>takde bapa</malay>
I see I see ya I mean is is it because <malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> #boon keng# <malay>takde bapa ke tinggal</malay> #boon keng# <malay>pasal takde bapa</malay>
I I curious [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
[oh]
[oh] <malay>dengan datuk dia</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba letak datuk</malay>
<malay>contohnya apa khabar</malay> [eh] are you close with the <malay>datuk</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> doctor <malay>apa</malay> though
like !wah! so I mean not bad [eh] <malay>walaupun dia tinggal</malay> at risk block <malay>mak dia</malay> doctor
<malay>kencang</malay> [seh] then <malay>kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak</malay> take her out you know
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine [ah]
I I'm wondering (uh) honestly curious
[oh] interesting [eh] psychology
[ah] psychology you <malay>pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak</malay> I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
!wah!
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify [kan]
<malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay> very good
I actually now you speaking of which [ah] I think I met someone like this you know <malay>tak tahu orang sama ke</malay> this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the #boon keng# area then there was this doctor <malay>dan dia punya kucing</malay>
so I was like <malay>tapi dia tengah pakai</malay> white coat [lah] [eh] doctor <malay>dengan kucing</malay>
ya so maybe [lah] it's the it's the same person [lah] loves animal right
[ah] [a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> vet I mean we don't know [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> career <malay>banyak</malay>
a lot of careers ya
but I mean okay [lah] so <malay>maknya</malay> consider good [lah] doctor
good [lah] <malay>tapi anaknya</malay>
(um) I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I heard <malay>anak dia</malay>
[ah] I don't know how I heard [lah] where I heard [lah] <malay>agaknya kat</malay> mothership <malay>anak dia macam</malay>
<malay>apa seorang</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay> or rather act a bit <malay>pelik</malay> you know
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
maybe <malay>dia punya anak</malay> needs treatment [lah] like like do you think so
[oh] mother's gossip
[a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] however <malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul tu</malay> maybe what we can do is we can actually find this (um) Q your distant relative we can <malay>ajak</malay> her [lah] go <malay>makan</malay> [oh] maybe #sedap# mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
<malay>banyak banyak banyak banyak</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> so
<malay>lagi</malay> more reason [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
(uh) maybe we should help [lah] we should help please tell
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true [lah] if someone is put in that environment they kind of <malay>macam</malay> angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you <malay>takde</malay> you know outlet <malay>boleh keluarkan</malay> the <malay>perasaan</malay>
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally [lah] [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay> her [eh] I [tau] eat him or her up like internally
so (um) it's important [lah] to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized [lah] in
(mm) [ah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay>
[ah] ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday [lah]
[ah] #sentosa# is it
that's how [ah] we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
(um) #sentosa# I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump <malay>itu</malay> I <malay>tak berani</malay>
so (um) #sentosa# maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar [ah]
you know we can just hang around at #sentosa# #sentosa# I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts [lor]
[ah] yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort #serapong# can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
tramp <malay>punya</malay> trail then we just <malay>macam</malay>
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say [lah] they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
you cannot claim compensation [lah] because it's at your own risk [mah] you <malay>masuk tempat gitu</malay> so
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good [lah] cause <malay>kalau kalau tak</malay> then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
[oh] ya ya how much is it [ah]
I'm not too sure I really don't
[oh] ya we can do that also (uh) I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
(err) (um) can [lah] I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
can also then luge <malay>macam laju</malay> [lah] a bit too fast don't you think so
ya as in [eh] as in the the timing also [lah]
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
morning will be best <malay>tapi</malay>
we can go <malay>malam</malay> [lah] or we can go like in the evening <malay>macam</malay> cold [kan] <malay>begitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> sunset
<malay>dia tak panas sangat</malay> and ya
not <malay>pergi maghrib</malay> I mean
can also [lah] because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
(mm) okay okay then then good [lah] I would think of saturday <malay>banyak orang</malay> but it should be fine [lah] should be fine [lah]

stephen stephen #chow#
<malay>abeh</malay>
[ah]
[a'ah]
ya
it's true [ah]
it makes sense [ah] cause like I mean like
it's not written anywhere [tau]
like which not written anywhere where <malay>kau ada cakap</malay> what I mean but it's an agreement between two people
but the same time if the two people have the agreement like <malay>macam kat</malay> france they have they have open relationship like I can sleep around whoever I want but at the end of the day I with you that kind of thing [kan]
but that's the funny thing like a lot of people say french people are more romantic [kan] but at the same time french people are much more open
like <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>aku tak boleh tidur</malay> [ah] like
<malay>aku tengok</malay> Twitter and like romanticism [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> !wah! annoying <malay>gila</malay> [sia]
like <malay>macam kau</malay> expect <malay>benda-benda merepek</malay> [tau] everything
like <malay>macam benda-benda macam merepek</malay> (oo) sweet <malay>nya</malay> sweet <malay>nya terus macam apa yang kau</malay> sweet <malay>sangat</malay> #siak#
like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] handphone <malay>tengah</malay> record <malay>kalau tak aku dah buka</malay> Twitter <malay>aku dah tunjuk</malay> all the things that
(uh huh)
[oh] that <malay>ada</malay> this girl [ah] there's this girl who <malay>ni mata air aku bilang</malay> there's this girl <malay>dia pakai tudung abeh dia nya</malay> boyfriend <malay>ada</malay> #angkong# <malay>semua</malay>
like <malay>macam tu</malay> so sweet <malay>macam</malay> she accepted him <malay>macam</malay> okay then after that like <malay>macam orang dia kata orang kat</malay> Twitter <malay>cakap gitu</malay>
<malay>terus macam</malay> (err) okay
ya
ya then after that like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
then the boyfriend keep on kissing <malay>dia punya</malay> cheeks kind of thing then <malay>macam</malay> (err) then recently [ah] the boyfriend go and message her the way he message her saying that
(um) singaporean <malay>bi</malay> I don't need sex [ah] I can wait I can live without sex
<malay>terus aku nak kata</malay> [lah] if he's not fucking you he's fucking with someone else [lah]
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa yang macam merepek</malay> [ah] like that's the thing [tau] <malay>macam bila aku dapat tahu pasal</malay> romanticism [kan]
and how we are actually romanticised by all these things that humans
<malay>ikut perasaan</malay> [tau] <malay>perangai macam lembik perangai macam kental ikut</malay> just to like <malay>macam</malay>
we believe it's such negative which actually weakens us [tau]
like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] I don't know how to explain [ah] <malay>nak kena tengok</malay> Twitter [ah] then after that <malay>aku</malay> can
really [ah] <malay>aku tunjuk aku</malay> can actually come to senses [ah] like <malay>tunjuk kau macam aku ambil</malay>
<malay>kita punya kedai</malay> handphone <malay>ada</malay> Twitter
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
<malay>takde</malay> Twitter [ah]
okay [lah]
<malay>camne</malay> [eh] <malay>nak</malay> explain
(oo) best [ah] <malay>kau kena tengok</malay> [ah] eileen the burton
eileen the burton [ah] [eh] for example [ah] the things <malay>yang dia</malay> highlight
[a'ah]
<malay>yang benda yang dia</malay> highlight is like especially <malay>macam perempuan</malay> do this <malay>padahal kita pun buat laki pun buat</malay> like <malay>macam kita padahal kita buat</malay> not only with <malay>kita</malay> partners <malay>dengan</malay> members <malay>pun sama</malay> [tau] like <malay>macam kau tak tahu</malay> [pe] <malay>aku satu minggu penat macam</malay> for example #dan# it can be as simple as #dan#
this week <malay>aku penat gila</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tak boleh turun boleh</malay> that kind of thing [tau] but we expect him to understand that [eh] <malay>kau dah bodoh</malay> [pe]
<malay>aku hari-hari kerja kau masih nak lepak sini</malay> [ah] that kind of thing [ah] it's like it's as easy as bro (uh) this week I quite full [lah] cannot come to the shop or not that kind of thing
but for us we assume he know and second thing we assume that he will get offended
[ah] this kind of thing [ah] so <malay>dia kata</malay> if it's a true love or if it's true friendship if you understand each other without saying which doesn't makes sense [ah]
<malay>abeh dia kata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> we expect to do that we expect
we expect that from an adult but when it comes to baby [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>dia cerita</malay> [kan] [ah] from a real life <malay>punya</malay> experiences <malay>dia balik</malay>
one week of work
<malay>dia balik</malay> then after that (err) <malay>anak dia anak dia</malay> baby <malay>dia</malay> give <malay>anak dia</malay> some food <malay>anak dia tepis</malay> toddler [ah] <malay>nangis terus</malay>
<malay>kalau bini dia dah sepak</malay> [ah] I mean <malay>dia kata aku dah bingit gila</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan bini aku</malay> but he's my son [lah] but what I did was I try to understand him
like <malay>macam</malay> why did he why did he behave this way <malay>dia nak berak ke</malay> pampers <malay>dia ini ke dia gigi nak</malay> grow <malay>ke gini gini</malay> [ah] that's why then after that that was thinking [ah] <malay>dia kata dia macam</malay> why can't I behave
like that towards my wife as well that kind of thing [lah] cause
[ah] like <malay>macam senang cakap bila kalau</malay>
<malay>benda gini</malay> we always talk about girls [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] what's wrong nothing that kind of thing like you can just tell me
but that's the thing [ah] like but at the end of the day also most guys also <malay>dorang tak tahu</malay> how to talk about
emotions <malay>macam suami</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if they feel something <malay>diam</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> #dan# <malay>pun diam</malay> unless <malay>kita</malay> brought it up really force him to talk about it then he will talk about it
this kind of thing [ah]
ya
[ah] yes yes yes
ya
[ah]
ya
(mm)
[a'ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak ada orang ajar</malay> I mean like they
in a way <malay>lelaki</malay> [kan]
there's no
they are left on their own [ah]
that's why <malay>dorang macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tak kesah pasal</malay> for example <malay>kalau laki laki</malay> [ah] <malay>siapa-siapa nak keluar</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita punya anak sedara ke siapa</malay> [pe] <malay>bapa pun macam nak pergi mana keluar</malay> take care [eh] <malay>jangan</malay> naughty naughty [eh] <malay>perempuan nak keluar kita kongkong</malay> that kind of thing [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>laki</malay> we are just left to be everybody understand everybody have a way of thinking that guys are they can make it out there [ah] quite expected to know everything or like <malay>kau</malay> should know find for the answers
but
<malay>kita</malay> is still need a manual [pe] in some ways <malay>cuma</malay> that differentiate people [lah] like how they actually view things [ah] like some people they will <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> continue to be lost lost lost lost lost lost <malay>sampai ke mampus anak bini semua masih</malay> lost <malay>ada kalau</malay> people have gone through a lot of shit [kan] then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] things cannot happen like this [ah] I want to find something better <malay>baru dorang</malay> improve

<malay>sekarang apa-apa</malay> #dan# <malay>buat nanti</malay> #syahmi# will find a reason to hate on it
just simple as that [ah]
<malay>pada aku ni macam</malay> a little bit romanticism in a way
[ah] this is also one [ah] shopping for a guy is so hard what do you guys like beside other girls' pictures
I mean like <malay>macam</malay>
to to a certain extent okay [lah] there are some guys who just like openly like <malay>ni semua macam</malay> that's the thing like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku tahu</malay> [sia] <malay>macam</malay> from experience I know girls
who secretly wants some guys [sial] [lah] living okay <malay>tak payah pergi jauh</malay> #adam# <malay>sendiri</malay> #siak# <malay>berapa banyak</malay> attached women go to him
talk to him and want something from him
<malay>dia macam</malay>
the fuck is that <malay>abeh kau nak</malay> come to <malay>aku</malay> like <malay>macam kau nak</malay> pure <malay>gila nak mampus</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> no I only think of you <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau jangan bedek</malay> [ah] <malay>kita manusia</malay> [ah] [sial]
[a'ah]
that's the thing okay about romanticism [kan] okay there's
<malay>dia kata</malay> one of the things that
is quite
toxic [ah] is when you
sex and marriage sex and love intertwine so <malay>dia kata apa</malay> [tau]
when you <malay>kira</malay>
that's why there's this research [ah] woman fall in love when they hit orgasm
most most likely they fall in love when they hit orgasm
and then (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (err)
so they intertwine sex <malay>dengan</malay> love so if someone can treat you like good
<malay>bagus gila nak mampus</malay> [tau]
sweet <malay>tapi dia tak boleh</malay> fuck you well [ah]
<malay>kau terus</malay> down
<malay>kau macam</malay> [oh] this is not true love
or in a way [ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> how I see it [ah] like most girls [kan] <malay>bila dia dah</malay> give themselves too easy to a guy
they want to make it happen cause they don't want to make it seem that they are hoe
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
<malay>yang apa nama dia ini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>aku macam</malay> try to understand [tau]
<malay>kadang mata air aku ada sikit</malay> annoying [ah] which is <malay>aku</malay> understand <malay>pada aku</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> believe in romanticism [ah]
before <malay>dia</malay> know <malay>aku</malay> [pe] so like (err)
when you place yourself like okay you're my true love
I can only have sex with you
I mean like it's a like confirm confirm <malay>tak boleh</malay> [tau]
and like <malay>macam kalau kau buat maknanya dah</malay> end of the story that kind of thing
it's not that <malay>aku nak main orang lain</malay> or what [ah]
but it's just that when you place that [kan] so slowly <malay>kau</malay> subconsciously
<malay>kau punya</malay> mind will go lower and lower in a sense that
(err) <malay>kalau apa nama dia</malay> that mind <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>kalau kau</malay> like <malay>orang lain</malay> [kan] sexually <malay>dah kira salah kalau kau</malay> have fun <malay>kalau</malay> that time <malay>dia ada</malay> issue with <malay>aku keluar kawan aku perempuan aku dah kenal dari dulu dah lama gila</malay>
<malay>terus dia tengok</malay> story <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you look you seem more happier with her <malay>tu aku dah kenal dia berapa lama macam aku aku</malay> happy <malay>pun salah ke</malay>
that kind of thing like <malay>macam</malay> so they will like if someone can replace can if someone can give him happiness
more than me
<malay>maknanya</malay> that person is for him then <malay>macam</malay> happiness comes in different form
what she gives me
he may not give me but what you give me
is something that she cannot
give me and what you give me is something that I want [ah]
so <malay>kau jangan</malay> think it the way just cause <malay>gini abeh kau</malay> down
<malay>abeh</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia dah tak suka aku</malay> like this
overthinking [ah] [ah] but at the end of the day there there's a lot of factors that contribute to this [ah]
one she's alone overseas
<malay>takleh keluar tak ada kawan tu semua</malay> that's what overthinking is a more commonly (err)
ya happen in that situation [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> all these toxic <malay>punya</malay>
toxic <malay>punya pemikiran</malay> [ah]
and like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pada aku</malay> most of the time <malay>kita tak gaduh</malay> it's just that disagreement [jer] [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> we talk about something disagree <malay>macam</malay> #dan# <malay>dengan ni</malay>
[ah] #dan# <malay>dengan</malay> #mel#
<malay>tapi tak sampai kita merajuk</malay> it's just that <malay>aku</malay> disagree <malay>atau</malay> certain things like <malay>macam dia kata</malay> I cannot sleep [ah] <malay>terus macam asal</malay> [oh] I
don't overthink <malay>kau bilang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>asal</malay> let me talk to you [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
ease your mind <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>apa aku boleh buat dia cakap tak nak nanti menyusahkan kau</malay>
<malay>abeh terus nanti kalau dah bilang</malay> then after that <malay>dia</malay> come to conclusion that <malay>dia</malay> overthinking <malay>abeh dia ingat macam</malay>
[oh] <malay>aku selalu buat orang susah</malay> [lah] <malay>aku selalu macam kita kena gaduh pada aku ni tak gaduh</malay>
<malay>ini bukan gaduh</malay> it's just us communicating [jer]
can you stop <malay>pasal</malay> that's the thing
<malay>macam</malay> all these romanticism [kan] <malay>benda-benda gini fikir gaduh</malay>
romanticism
<malay>pada dia</malay> [kan] love is love hundred per cent all the time having fun

and you are offended
I don't know what else to talk about
<malay>tadi korang cakap berbual pasal</malay> happiness <malay>pun macam</malay>

a random question you know what is like you know what is really out of this world [ah] these questions like literally out of this world
if you
could be
an animal what would you be and why have we
I don't know I'm still thinking of my answer now
<malay>kambing</malay>
a giraffe
that is so unlike your current scale
yes
but <malay>cita-cita kena tinggi</malay> always
reaching yes
yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they're like very different than other animals but also elephants are quite different
have you elephants much or more loving detail
whenever I think about elephants I think about [ah] mister <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>yang dari</malay> sesame street <malay>tu</malay>
yes cute <malay>gila</malay> please <malay>bulu mata</malay> [jer] you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> (oo)
ya that what I was thinking
[eh]
[a'ah] <malay>dah habis haus sangat tapi macam nak kencing sekarang</malay> [eh]
just over there
(mm)
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
[ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay>
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also [lah]
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I guess it's the same feeling as like taking a play but you can see everything I <malay>apa</malay> [ah] just like I cannot
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
[ah] how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
[ah] about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time [oh] !wow! yet
amazing [ah]
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
<malay>itu</malay> front stab
want to stab yes

I can be anything I want
I want to break free

like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
(mm)
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this
okay what do you want to be

(mm)
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya

and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be

a lot of my friends are like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know
how to do it and like or
like you know like
what are the right ways to do it [lah] basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow
ya
I mean I do have like
investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me

and then just damn <malay>pelik</malay> [ah] [sia] and he host around with anything that moves
<malay>aku pun tak tahu aku</malay> just don't know [lah]

they been friends for damn long [ah] but
#zul# <malay>pun</malay> petty <malay>nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap</malay> like I don't want to talk to #rumi# cause he never wish me happy birthday
<malay>macam apa kau merepek</malay> [eh]

girl <malay>kalau aku lupa nak</malay> wish <malay>kau macam mana</malay> [eh] how [ah] and was like I probably won't talk to you [ah]
I <malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak faham</malay> I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday <malay>dia macam</malay> like <malay>dia cakap</malay> birthday is important [what] it's once a year what so hard
what's so hard about (um) wishing some happy birthday
then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like if you're not
in good terms with that person why you expecting that person to wish
it doesn't make sense wouldn't you be more boiled up then
than happy
[ah] <malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah]
but #zul# know I know #zul# (um) <malay>tak</malay> comfortable cause of <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa tu namanya</malay>
(um) #rumi# I think #rumi# <malay>macam menggatal dengan dia</malay> also

unfortunately for his case [lah] but I think that time #zul# was with dylan <malay>dengan mata air dia</malay> [ah]
ya and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> like #rumi# [eh] #rumi# uncomfortable and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I know we are all closed <malay>kita</malay> very touchy also cause we hug a lot <malay>ni semua</malay> then
<malay>dia cakap</malay> #rumi# #rumi# does that [ah] but #rumi# <malay>macam</malay>
kind of
give the weird weird vibe
(mm)
you know when it's not touchy cause you are naturally touchy but
it's <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>nak menggatal</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [ah]
but #rumi# I've always seen as that way cause first time <malay>aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu</malay>
but first night is cool cause
<malay>kita semua minum</malay> [pe] together at sticky fingers
(ugh)
yes boss

<malay>kat tempat</malay> the weirdest place
ya and <malay>dia ada</malay> motor I think
I think <malay>dia ada</malay> motor #vespa#
#vespa# <malay>dia macam ada</malay> shield <malay>macam</malay> that big ass shield <malay>kat depan</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> very <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> indie <malay>macam dia nak</malay> stand out from the rest
<malay>dia macam dia</malay> kind of mainstream but <malay>dia tak nak</malay> show <malay>yang dia</malay> mainstream so he gets something that is
a little mainstream but not so mainstream
<malay>macam kawan kau ni</malay> [ah] also <malay>macam</malay> motor <malay>tak banyak</malay> but actually people want that kind of bike
if it's a lot of people but
ya <malay>dia macam gitu</malay> [jer]

good for what for iraq
we'll see [lah] we'll see <malay>kalau kau masuk</malay> army <malay>ke tak</malay> okay
petition for <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
of course [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> standardise <malay>dia nya</malay> family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum <malay>kat tempat</malay> the car wash <malay>kat</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> like
[oh] #baba lele# is then <malay>macam aku</malay> and then pop is police then <malay>aku macam</malay> like okay [what] <malay>kalau adik masuk</malay> at least <malay>dia belajar</malay> real life skills <malay>kalau tak masuk</malay> paramedic <malay>pun</malay> at least <malay>ada</malay> firefighter cause <malay>ada dua</malay> [jer] [pe] <malay>yang</malay>

ya so there are a lot of relatable things just that
<malay>aku rasa</malay> mama <malay>kau</malay> die die <malay>tak nak kau masuk</malay> police [lah] or just cause <malay>dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya</malay> son go through the

technically <malay>budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada</malay> choice [pe] <malay>apa benda</malay> before enlistment you can <malay>apa tu</malay> fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause <malay>dorang cakap banyak orang</malay> depression <malay>cakap yang dorang kena campak</malay> to different organisation and then <malay>dorang</malay> suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill <malay>punya</malay> shit
(mm) ya
especially <malay>banyak orang</malay> complain [sia] <malay>aku tak faham aku</malay> that day <malay>pergi balik</malay> to my academy <malay>aku tengok</malay>

[oh] right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no [lah]
you still hype <malay>dia masih ada</malay> serious serious because right now (um) the movie just came out <malay>abeh macam</malay>
all all of us (uh) <malay>kita pergi tengok</malay> movie <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
there are some of our friends also <malay>dorang masih belum tengok</malay>
but they still do watch the anime [ah]
and also <malay>tak salah aku</malay> the season two <malay>pun belum keluar kalau kau belum</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau baru nak</malay> start the hype you still [ah] don't have to wait so long for the season two
but
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out <malay>sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu</malay> season two possibly <malay>dorang akan keluar</malay> like
(err) cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
(uh) september twenty nineteen
ya Netflix it came out [ah] slow but it came out came out right april <malay>tak salah</malay> april twenty twenty that's when the hype <malay>betul-betul naik</malay> [ah] [sia] and <malay>apa</malay> everytime
like (uh) there's some <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that [ah] the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also (err) <malay>dia nya</malay> #manga# because normally #mangas# like <malay>macam</malay> for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach (uh) #naruto#
<malay>dorang punya</malay> like the amount of copies that they [kan]
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>tak salah aku</malay> one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay [lah] this is just a rough gauge all of them [ah] took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
<malay>untuk</malay> demon slayer for the #manga# <malay>aje</malay> [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> !wah! it's only four years [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> hundred and twenty million <malay>dah</malay>
[orh] ya
exactly
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[ah] at the sorry [ah] at the mountain right
[oh] ya
!wah!
so
does that mean [ah] in the future will be a demand also
with drums [ah] [ah] <malay>tapi pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] japanese [kan] <malay>kita melayu kita kita kompang</malay>
<malay>masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya</malay> [eh] <malay>asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar</malay> [eh]
[oh] ya
[orh] ya that [one] is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six [eh] !wah! he's really strong
ya
such coward
!wah!
man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
ya the like what they say [ah] <malay>apa</malay> actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how <malay>apa</malay> #gui# is [ah] as a person
but but
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dia nya</malay> other than the anime
(um) <malay>apa</malay> soundtrack <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
it really blews me away [ah] blows me away sorry
because one thing about (uh) anything in general [ah] <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a show or something [kan]
it is more emotional <malay>kalau dia nya</malay> soundtrack is a very <malay>macam</malay> it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer <malay>sekarang</malay> the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa <malay>yang</malay> the opening
[ah] opening [ah]
(mm)
(mm) ya
ya
it's like (err) one thing good about anime is like there's no
[ah] pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of certain events in their life
and <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
that it becomes like everyday object everyday [ah] actions are <malay>sampai</malay> they don't know [ah] they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but !wah! it's
mind blowing [ah] legit
ya
ya
ya
(um)
(mm) ya
(uh) one piece
ya
[oh] ya
not too much
it's it's (uh) it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
[orh] ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
for all the #animes# [ah] I watch <malay>semua ikut yang</malay> this <malay>dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang</malay>
<malay>macam aku rasa</malay> like one shot there's this thing called one shot #animes# <malay>dorang</malay> usually <malay>macam</malay> forty plus minutes <malay>abeh dah tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia macam</malay> a short a short film [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> but it the sometimes like
<malay>orang fikir</malay> like [oh] the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters [ah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> even like those thirty or ten minute films [kan] it leaves a very
(uh) everlasting mark in your in your memory <malay>macam tak boleh lupakan</malay> it's that good [ah] like the story storytelling even (uh) the soundtrack cause come on man [ah] without soundtrack anything will be boring [lah]
exactly cause that's why I I always [ah]
I always envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for [ah] films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
[ah] ya
[ah] ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
[oh] ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take [oh] wait no other than that got physics [lah] but that's all [lah] physics should be simpler because this [one]
its pre-calculus [sia] what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
[oh] is it the
the position vector [eh]
!wow!
it's okay man it's okay <malay>aku nya</malay> A math <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bila entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> there's this kind of stigma [ah] whenever you go to school or like university [ah] in that case
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that <malay>macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh</malay>
[ah] I I shared this with my one of my friends [ah] <malay>dia pun tengah ambil</malay> university but I think is like I think ya so ya [ah] bro that [one] is just that's just one person [lah] don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
ya so (err) ya that's why exactly but okay [lah] the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you (err) encounter like many problem solving [ah] methods or like
especially <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> coding <malay>atau</malay> math [kan] there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where <malay>macam</malay> [oh] wait what's going on I don't understand [sia] and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly <malay>atau atau</malay> secondary school [tau]
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me [ah] because one thing (um)
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with (um) other people or like
(uh) actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to [ah] do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like (mm) I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
(mm)
ya
<malay>sebab mak aku</malay> english teacher
(uh) ya ya
(mm)
that sounds
crystallisation thinking [eh]
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
ya and also <malay>macam</malay> being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called (err) from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
(uh) soft skills that they're born with
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is !huh!
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill [lah] but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
(uh) your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood [lah] in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own (uh) thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you [ah] in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
(uh) you you just you don't want to bring up the (uh) negative (uh) vibe when you speak up
so this the intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts [lah] so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
[ah] ya
(mm) ya
<malay>macam apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia ni</malay> like <malay>asal asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kecil hati</malay> exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like [eh] don't don't be so abrupt don't be so <malay>macam</malay> rude [ah] <malay>kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini</malay> [kan] the person who speak all those abrupt words or <malay>macam kasar</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] normal [lah] <malay>takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe]</malay> so I'll just continue with what I'm doing [ah]
(mm)
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
ya and and in okay [ah] in university especially
adapting and also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what's that word again (uh) you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
okay
cannot
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
drop
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh] !wow!
!wow!
it's (uh) it's the same thing for my my school also cause (err) if I'm not wrong [ah] is (err) when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university [lah] if you never meet their requirement after like every semester or something
but (uh) if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time (um) if you are if you have a academic warning already
<malay>abeh kalau</malay> your
<malay>dah macam</malay>
lesser than two point eight
then <malay>kau akan dapat</malay> suspension
suspension meaning
<malay>satu tahun kau</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau</malay> [ah] [eh] sorry
after one year then <malay>kau kena</malay> re-enroll
ya
(um) when you are in a academic warning <malay>punya ni</malay> [ah] ya
if you haven't get academic warning then <malay>asalkan</malay> your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save [lah]
[ah] ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that to increase by a bit
ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam [ah]
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
[oh] [eh]
!wah!
[orh] okay I
<malay>ada</malay> is that <malay>macam kau nya</malay> topic <malay>bukan</malay> topic <malay>apa</malay> module module is that module <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kau nak kena belajar pasal</malay> another language
like <malay>macam</malay> malay <malay>atau</malay> mandarin
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[orh] is it the same as <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau nak berbual melayu</malay>
<malay>ada benda kita nak kena</malay> reverse the structure of a of a word
!huh!
[oh]
ya
<malay>macam nak cakap</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> english post office <malay>abeh melayu pejabat</malay> post <malay>dia dia dia macam</malay> reverse [ah] it's in that that way [ah] like <malay>buat orang macam</malay> confusing
but is it mean the same thing
prof [oh] professor
french
[orh] is it
<malay>pejabat</malay> post
[oh] like <malay>apa</malay> dialects [ah] slang slang
(mm)
[oh] I
[ah]
(mm)
(um) is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in (uh) game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is (uh) user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience [ah] since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>baru-baru punya</malay> module <malay>yang apa nak nak kena ajar</malay> like <malay>aku rasa</malay> for example like
(uh) in the market I guess one thing <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam banyak-banyak tukar</malay> is the job finding
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say (err) user experience [kan]
normally <malay>macam tak banyak kerja pasal</malay> user experience [mah] because it's not that known to be (uh) to be like a proper job <malay>orang fikir macam</malay> !alah! <malay>ni orang lain buat boleh buat</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> it's another job
on top of the job that <malay>orang tengah buat</malay> but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object <malay>macam kau pegang cawan</malay>
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right <malay>abeh kau imagine kalau</malay> they handle <malay>ada duri</malay> <malay>tak</malay> comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics (err) the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though <malay>macam</malay> it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
<malay>macam kau tengah</malay> bad mood <malay>abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa</malay>
[ah] [kan] so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this (uh) tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say (um) enjoyed the little happiness in life
because if you [ah] if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
like (err) happiness like for example <malay>kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja</malay>
<malay>dekat tempat kerja ni yang gaji dia bagi tujuh ribu abeh kau sekarang tengah kerja kat tempat kerja ni yang bagi kau seribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] how am I gonna get to that level so <malay>kau kau</malay> (uh) <malay>bertungkus-lumus kau</malay> (uh) <malay>cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak</malay> and that process <malay>buat kau</malay> bad mood
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
[ah]
ya
[ah]
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
some people <malay>dorang dah</malay> so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money <malay>walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih</malay>
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset <malay>macam</malay> [oh] since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it (uh)
they imagine them like [eh] with this
I I'll look good [ah] like [ah] with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
(mm)
ya
exactly
but I guess (um)
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
(um) elon musk [eh] he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can [ah] achieve
like <malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] like he said in two years [eh]
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
[ah] if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was (err) I okay [lah] when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy [lah] of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
[ah] their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
[oh] [ah] sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely all the
<malay>cam rezeki akan di diberikan</malay> like don't focus always on the <malay>rezeki</malay> focus on like
what make things work in in the last time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> retrospect [ah] but for now it's more like
(uh) we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
which is why I appreciate like all those people <malay>yang</malay> even though it's just [ah] comic books or like anime [kan] it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to [lah]
[ah] [ah] ya roller coaster
(mm) ya you have to take a break [ah]
that's why I feel
[ah] for this anime <malay>macam</malay> all these [one]
(uh)
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
that's why like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] ya <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience [lah] the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
which is why I also like how (um) okay [lah] not demon slayer something much more large scale which is Marvel
!wow!
Marvel is (uh) huge scale of
all the things that you [ah]
you imagine it to happen
it's happening in in that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] alternate universe [lah] in a way [ah] ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is <malay>dorang</malay> they <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam</malay> the movie <malay>walaupun</malay> that movie <malay>ada banyak orang macam</malay> superpower [kan] <malay>tapi dorang buatkan</malay> character <malay>tu macam</malay> he goes through everyday life as per normal but (uh) they somehow <malay>macam</malay> in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though <malay>ada orang dorang tak ada</malay> [ah] superpower <malay>tapi</malay> a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something <malay>yang buatkan kau macam</malay> strongly
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero [ah] but with no actual superpower
(uh huh) game of thrones [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
[orh] ya
cool
[orh]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
the black widow and iron man started
(mm)
[oh] ya
gauntlet
ya
(um) assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
tell you about it like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam orang gemuk</malay> like they want to achieve being slim like have that [ah] that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like [eh] <malay>dah kurus</malay> [eh] [sia] <malay>baik [pe]</malay> but actually <malay>kau kau tak tahu</malay> like the process itself <malay>buatkan kau nak</malay> slim <malay>kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau dah kurus</malay> [kan]
you'll feel good [lah]
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal (uh) weight your optimal image <malay>tapi</malay> the
the thought of people <malay>macam dorang perasan</malay> like <malay>kau tengah berubah</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> you looking more slim or looking more [ah] toned your body looks so toned then <malay>kau</malay> you'll feel better and it helps to
make your drive even
(uh)
higher
<malay>tapi</malay> it's it's I guess this little happiness <malay>macam kalau nak</malay> go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness <malay>buat kau macam</malay> maintain your course cause <malay>ada orang</malay> let's say <malay>pasal yang</malay> language [one] <malay>aku pun tengah</malay> another language is called C sharp programming language
so that [one] (err) I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
(uh) good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements [ah] but in that case also like if you were to think about it [ah]
for this different generations like <malay>sejak</malay> okay [ah] this past few hundred years [ah] there has been certain developments in (uh) certain parts of (uh) humanity like last time there's (uh) agriculture industrial evolution [kan] then there's (uh)
now [eh] ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some knowledge so I thought okay [lah] maybe
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if <malay>aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam</malay>
<malay>aku nak</malay> keep up to date to certain things <malay>jadi macam</malay> I'm not
(uh) losing in the race for finding jobs <malay>atau</malay> (uh) skill sets so
<malay>aku</malay> push myself [ah] I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes <malay>kalau kau buat benda sorang</malay> like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make [ah] it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
(uh) it's it's hard [ah] is the most hardest thing for me
[orh]
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of there are more people that are saying like [ah] if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be [ah] okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
[ah] [ah] too introvert that they they don't want to show their weaknesses [lah] there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
(mm) can say [lah]
ya ya
especially if you okay [lah] probably <malay>yang buatkan kau malu</malay> is <malay>kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku</malay> assume that <malay>walaupun susah</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> I can just Google <malay>apa</malay> Google is there for me to help <malay>boleh</malay> search <malay>senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri</malay>
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
(uh) the the amid the Google search <malay>yang kau buat</malay>
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work <malay>kalau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau ikut</malay> [jer] it will definitely not work
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay [lah] before
uni [ah] you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like (uh) you learn programming all this and that it's useful because [ah] we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
(uh) how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
(uh) good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
[ah] exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
(uh) biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience <malay>macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam</malay> five <malay>dorang main ke</malay> I mean
for educational purpose
ya like okay <malay>kalau aku</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> aim for
<malay>apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar</malay> like <malay>tiga tahun empat tahun</malay> [ah] not not not not <malay>tak tahu belajar</malay> I mean <malay>tak tahu tak tahu buat</malay> math like <malay>aku bagi dorang</malay> game <malay>pasal</malay> math <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nya macam</malay> quizzes <malay>aku bagi</malay> chemistry
<malay>lari</malay> [kan] that's why (err) that target audience is the most important thing when <malay>kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam untuk kau</malay> [eh] best [sia] game <malay>ni ada</malay> chemistry <malay>tapi kau tak tahu</malay> actually your audience is <malay>yang orang yang nak belajar pasal</malay> math
[oh] but okay [lah] cone
like iron man okay <malay>ni ni ni betul-betul</malay> (uh) off track
[ah] ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart [lah] like he might be one of the inspiration where <malay>aku</malay> will continue programming because
in in a way like the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
scenario <malay>kalau orang betul-betul</malay> don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so <malay>aku rasa</malay> like programming is a
it's a good it's a
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
ya ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
[ah] ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth [sia]
that's why <malay>aku</malay> really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years [lah] give or take
in
[oh]
ya
strap [eh]
[orh] [oh] ya
probably they
I mean they will have a controlled environment <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia nya apa tu</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam</malay> this sphere <malay>abeh kalau ada ikut macam</malay> earth <malay>punya udara</malay> inside that sphere <malay>aku rasa</malay> everything should be fine <malay>kalau orang kena tanam ke apa</malay> there might be a proper grave for them <malay>cuma</malay>
it's weird [lah] it it's weird [ah] cause <malay>tak pernah dengar orang</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>mana kubur kau bukan kau</malay> [ah] <malay>mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa</malay> [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> mars [ah] <malay>aku nak merawat</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> spaceship but that is a possible future also like <malay>kalau</malay> let's say when elon musk <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you have your own spaceship <malay>macam kereta sekarang</malay> but <malay>kau nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [ah] moon <malay>jap kau nak makan</malay> [ah] moon burger [eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita gi makan sekarang</malay> K <malay>jap aku ambil</malay> spaceship <malay>aku</malay>
ya <malay>abeh kau</malay> [ah] fly [ah] okay [ah] <malay>ni</malay> set [ah] to moon then <malay>dia nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau cakap</malay> okay (uh) ten minutes ride okay
<malay>abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang</malay> Grab [pe] so <malay>kau</malay> call (uh) space Grab
[eh] [eh] best [sia]
[oh] man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive [ah] to experience it
unless <malay>bila</malay> mars <malay>dah ada</malay> a way to like
persevere humanity to maintain young
[orh]
[ah] ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
[oh]
[a'ah] #akaza#
a demon
[orh]
[oh] ya
maybe the thought of that like <malay>macam aku tahu aku tak mati</malay> so <malay>buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua</malay> you become complacent
then <malay>kau</malay> complacent then then there's no progress in life [lah] <malay>macam semua dah</malay> convenient <malay>untuk kau [pe]</malay> or <malay>aku boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>aku boleh tengok</malay> anime <malay>hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati</malay> [pe] so <malay>takyah belajar</malay> [ah] <malay>takyah belajar apa takyah mandi</malay> cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
I will still stay young [what] I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
makes humanity not to deserve to have a (um) <malay>apa</malay> eternal life
[ah]
[ah] upper moon
ya
same
(mm)
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live [ah] eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said (um)
the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
but not the things like <malay>macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni bagus</malay> [sia] okay <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> for example <malay>kalau</malay> michael jackson
<malay>dia buat buat lagu semua macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia tak mati</malay> it's still there [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] a legend it has it is a legend because
(err) people who die I don't know [ah] this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die [lah] normally
ya
that's humans [lah] in a way [ah] that it's a beauty [ah] like when you die you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know [lah] but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
[ah] set the bar
ya
so imagine if like [ah] the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] wrestling or any any person in interest [lah] like [oh]
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already [lah] even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any (uh)
impact yet
the same goes for <malay>ni</malay> [ah] the the the football legend
ya #maradona#
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few (uh) weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
[ah]
passing
[ah] ya ya
it's like it heightens your
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ada buat aku susah</malay> but

I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he (uh) that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film [eh] or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
<malay>anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik</malay>
ya
be a good children
then
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
(mm) ya
(uh) ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
(uh) then we find it
(err)
<malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa</malay> canteen <malay>itu murah</malay> [lah]
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
<malay>tak boleh jual macam ayam goreng</malay>
(uh)
<malay>ikan goreng yang goreng-goreng itu tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kita kena kurangkan minyak</malay>
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tapi masalah dia</malay>
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals [lah] to work there
ya so
(err) <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang yang nak</malay>
<malay>bagi kita itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau saya ambil alih</malay>
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
<malay>macam mana nak masak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>boleh masak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
(um)
mostly is malay food like #mee soto# #mee rebus#
#nasi lemak#
and those kind of things [lah] <malay>macam nasi putih nasi</malay>
<malay>lauk-lauk</malay>
so
(err) <malay>jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>baru saya boleh buka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sebab</malay> because at schools they have (err)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
so <malay>kita kena jual benda yang sama</malay>
ya
so (uh)
<malay>orang yang nak jual itu</malay>
canteen they they <malay>cakap</malay> they <malay>ada</malay>
business <malay>lain</malay> so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ</malay> [lah] because
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them [lah]
ya
so <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> now we are
searching for the suitable space [lah] first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
(err) good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya (mm)
because
I
<malay>saya tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa itu kalau tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada kesihatan itu</malay>
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
<malay>duit itu kita boleh cari tapi kalau kesihatan tak ada</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
ya (mm) <malay>maksud saya yang</malay> my first wish <malay>yang anak-anak jadi baik itu</malay>
<malay>bukan baik</malay> I mean it's <malay>baik</malay> overall [lah] it's good
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>awak ada apa-apa awak boleh cakap dengan saya kalau saya boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
ya so it's best either you share everything [lah]
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
[ah]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)

(mm) but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
(err)
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish

if if you are considering higher education <malay>mana awak nak belajar</malay> singapore <malay>ke</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] they have and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
[eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini</malay> then go
<malay>ajar budak</malay> primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya nak</malay> like I said
<malay>nak buka</malay> business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
<malay>kalau tak</malay> another option would be like <malay>macam</malay> work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay>
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
<malay>dekat sini</malay>
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
<malay>bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang</malay>
normal <malay>macam demam macam</malay> the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
<malay>tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you know unexpected
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
<malay>mahal sangat</malay>
so let's
(err) <malay>bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit</malay>
then <malay>memang orang itu dah</malay> stress because of the illness
ya so <malay>kalau dia tak ada duit</malay>
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
I wish [lah] if <malay>orang yang macam</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa tak ada tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat</malay>
so they get I think government <malay>ada juga</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi</malay> I wish they
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
ya <malay>itu</malay> maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
<malay>tapi yang macam</malay> chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
<malay>lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>nanti kena</malay>
master
[oh] okay
<malay>itu satu</malay> (err) swimming <malay>sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar</malay> swimming
<malay>berenang</malay>
(err) is with is with a private coach
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat itu</malay>
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya <malay>sebab</malay> (err) coach <malay>itu boleh datang</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ</malay>
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on [lah]
I mean (uh) last time <malay>saya pernah ada juga pergi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dua tahun selepas</malay>
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
<malay>tapi</malay> coach <malay>itu walaupun</malay> <malay>dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh</malay> lessons
<malay>tapi</malay> the coach is like (uh) not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven <malay>tapi</malay> each lesson <malay>itu</malay>
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
<malay>ada dia punya itu</malay> [lah] result
so (um) <malay>berenang itu</malay>
(uh) so I I I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
<malay>lagi satu itu saya</malay>
because <malay>sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima</malay>
so <malay>sekarang</malay>
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture

correct your alignment something like that ya
active
<malay>ada</malay> pilates

it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
ya like I said <malay>dulu punya</malay> coach <malay>itu</malay>

(mmhmm)
ya
one dish
(mm)
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast [lah]
I don't mind
but (err) only the downside is that
(err) because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
no bread toast is just I like [lah] but not (mm) not I eat something that I eat rest of my life <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay>
(um)
I would rather go for something with proteins
like <malay>macam</malay>
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
<malay>kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>saya tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>awak</malay>
ya
maggi <malay>mee</malay>

ya
fried rice
[oh] #mee hoon# #tom yum#
okay
[ah]
okay
so how was the rice today (uh) the #mandi# rice
the <malay>nasi</malay> arab <malay>itu</malay>
ya smoke <malay>sebab</malay> smoke <malay>itu tak kuat</malay> smoke
the smoke is just like only on the surface
then it will you know <malay>dia akan hilang cepat</malay>
ya
<malay>itu bukan keras</malay> [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>bawah itu yang dah rangup</malay>
<malay>nasi yang dah</malay>
curry
(hmm)
ya <malay>tak tak tapi</malay>
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best (um) #mandi# rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
(mm)
okay
(mm)
pizza <malay>dekat mana</malay>
pizza hut
!hey! which pizza you ate [ah]
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(err) tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of <malay>minyak sapi</malay>
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all <malay>minyak sapi</malay> or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
you <malay>boleh</malay> you <malay>boleh letak rempah-rempah dia</malay> like <malay>kayu manis buah pelaga</malay> is
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
<malay>bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak</malay> [lah] because it's only one cup of rice
so just one one will do one small piece of
<malay>kayu manis</malay>
<malay>buah pelaga satu cukup</malay>
then <malay>cengkih</malay> is clove
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
<malay>macam daun salam</malay> is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) you <malay>letak garam</malay>
(err) according to your taste [lah]
<malay>garam</malay> then when it when the
water starts to boil you <malay>letak itu beras</malay>
then you cook [lah] rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version [lah] there's many kind of
(err) <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you are talking about <malay>nasi minyak</malay> right
(uh) <malay>nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
<malay>ada letak</malay>
instead of (uh) instead of
all water they will mix with half half like <malay>susu cair</malay>
half <malay>susu cair</malay> half water
so what's that one and a half cup right
no <malay>nasi lemak kita letak santan</malay>
this is <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
ya <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit [lah]
(mm) then you <malay>boleh letak daun pandan daun serai</malay>
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>boleh letak</malay> tomato
(uh)
you (uh) <malay>boleh letak</malay> chilli <malay>hijau semua</malay> [lah] then you put half half [lah] <malay>separuh</malay>
<malay>separuh susu cair</malay>
<malay>jadi tiga suku tiga suku</malay>
(uh) then the same method you put the (uh) <malay>garam</malay>
then you put the rice
the other one the taste will be <malay>macam kenduri punya nasi lemak</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya
ya that one is more like (uh) is (uh) more with it goes well with like <malay>macam ayam masak merah rendang semua</malay>
ya <malay>ini nasi minyak</malay> simple <malay>punya</malay> so it goes well with (uh) curry chicken
ya curry chicken [lah] the best with potatoes
(mm)
can
no [oh] it's it's
it's easy to make

<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>dia kawan aku</malay>

okay so (um) about #fahim# thing
(err)
the other day

I'm going to say something about
brother herme
[kan]
<malay>tapi kau</malay>
<malay>kau jangan</malay> get rile up [ah]
okay so the other day <malay>aku jumpa dia</malay>
right
#ayip#
pick me up after work
I you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
<malay>kita gi makan</malay>
and all that
then on the way back (err) I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
[oh] down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
[oh] it's one of those kind I like like like (um) on the video <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
they would [ah] play <malay>macam</malay>
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things [ah]
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
[ah] then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired [ah]
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
[ah] us ya
so (um) then he was saying how (um)
how did they go into it I
okay so <malay>dia cakap macam</malay>
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
(err)
<malay>kalau aku</malay> #hilmi#
[kan]
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think #hilmi# actually supports [ah] no of course not
then [ah] he #wafan# was saying ya but you know the act of <malay>macam</malay> more or less you're saying
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do [lah]
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up [ah]
then he was saying how (um)
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
I was wondering <malay>kalau</malay>
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that [ah]
so now what now is just
<malay>matair</malay> [jer]
!huh! !huh!
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know I understand where he's coming from <malay>sebab</malay>
it's
it doesn't feel
great [ah]
help help that's a fucking understatement [kan] ya but <malay>macam</malay>
I was telling him [ah] like they are gonna
in a in a very tough spot <malay>aku macam</malay> put it in a more personal light [ah] I'm saying that I totally not okay
[ah] when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him [eh] I but mine wasn't cause of cheating [ah] of course
so
like if I was the cheater
like would you still hang out with me <malay>tak</malay>
in that sense
and then <malay>macam cakap</malay>
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit [tau]
ya
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then <malay>dia macam maki sekejap</malay> [ah]
like normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
[eh]
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea I was just saying okay
!hey! brother
you should remind me to bring an cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
<malay>asal kau nak gini</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak tak tak</malay>
it it
singapore is very small
<malay>kau nak main lagu apa</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> he said that he said that ultimate like <malay>pakcik</malay> thing to say that [ah] that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this [one] <malay>pakcik</malay> thing but he said the other part <malay>pakcik</malay> thing
<malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>nanti aku tak boleh</malay> focus
[oh] !wow!
!wow! that's that's going into the wrong direction [ah]
so anyways right
ya so (um) about that I think then he was
telling me that
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you <malay>aku masih boleh</malay>
<malay>lepak dengan kau</malay> [ah] kind of thing
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
<malay>aku macam</malay> okay
fair enough [ah]
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch [ah]
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
let's say <malay>kau nak main macam</malay> devil's advocate kind of thing
like how do you defend
[ah] his his actions from a moral standpoint [ah]
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am [lah] [kan]
so what do you feel about the difference <malay>macam</malay> in terms of
(uh) being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
okay but what do you think of her <malay>macam dia punya</malay> character and such
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given [ah]
(mm)
I don't know that's a very controversial statement [ah]
so by those dates
you you describe it as (um)
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from [ah] <malay>macam aku faham</malay> but I don't think it's matter of gender [tau]
to me that [one] it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender [lah] like that's true
right
okay
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
#fahim# isn't exactly mister olympia material himself [pe]
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the (err)
how do I put this
okay
rounder side of life [ah]
at !wah! that's
brother why you got to use the F word
what it post
!wah! I cannot
[sial] [ah]
<malay>bodoh gila</malay> [pe]
brunei
[eh] no no no no no
I've been to brunei
okay so
[ah] people in brunei
no I'm not talking about like the
workers are like the they have a lot of like foreign workers
<malay>sama sama</malay> situation as us [ah]
no but they are middle
income people there
right
half of them are
bulgy chonkers <malay>juga</malay> [tau]
ya
so like (uh) I was asking bell [lah] that time it's like why [ah]
like
when we do say you know
a couple of
chonkers due here in
singapore
[ha] [ha]
but
do you see more that there
then she was saying [oh] then she was expecting okay (um) one thing is
<malay>dia punya</malay> their food
[kan] <malay>dorang punya makanan</malay>
[ah] it's
the portion [kan] <malay>besar gila</malay>
that's A
B
(err) a public transport is a fucking nightmare
everyone drives
<malay>tapi</malay> there's no incentive too you know
<malay>buat apa</malay>
but there's no tourism to speak of
but that [one] also doesn't paint like (err) <malay>macam</malay> compete picture <malay>juga</malay> cause a lot of the citizens <malay>dorang punya</malay> baseline is met
free education free healthcare
right
I mean
okay (uh) as a brown guy here <malay>aku pun</malay> free education [ah] up to a point
but healthcare is not free [what]
ya
[oh] ya
we get sidetrack <malay>macam anjing</malay>
so basically I was
I was talking about [ah] about #ruqayyah# and then we talking about ya okay so
your your whole day your
I think what you're trying to say in summary is that
<malay>dia macam</malay>
a bit spoilt
like
and she doesn't have that drive in her to
do more
like
(uh huh)
wait so there are
other factors <malay>juga</malay>
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
(err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
no no no no no
[ah]
so what is it about the home wrecker <malay>yang</malay>
you know
[eh]
!wow!
why does it sound (mm)
(mmhmm)
like it just physical
[oh] man
<malay>tak aku</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> urge to choke slam <malay>dia</malay> is like rising [ah] it's
!wow!
but
I don't
the thing is right
I don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
like the underlying issue is still there <malay>apa</malay> like he's basically not happy
<malay>tapi dia tahu tak</malay>
<malay>kenapa dia tak happy</malay>
how else you gonna get and loot
you know
I don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a <malay>dengki</malay> thing [ah]
it's a revenge thing [ah]
maybe
very complicated stuff
you know like I know we've known the guy for like forever
I never thought
(mmhmm)
now is what
fourteen years
no I never
don't want to say that but you said but you said it
ya I never thought you with #tino# until but then again all of us
ya but somehow in in in your mind you always thinking you know okay (uh) marriage is like the big leveller [ah]
it would down
calm down his raging lions that kind of thing
do you even iron clothes
[oh] I haven't seen an iron board in years [ah] dude
what for
but if you see me tons of time <malay>aku mana</malay> iron anything
ya
(mm)
so anyways
I don't remember that
[ha] [ha]
!wow!
no but it's one of those things that it just <malay>macam</malay> it creeps up on you
like like no one just wakes up one day twenty kilo heavier [pe]
don't care what you eat but the [oh] how many times you eat [lah] in that sense
wait
what's
what's your weight now [ah]
!wow!
[eh] is it
I I don't
is it
is it normal for your height I I don't actually know
right so if you
it's like you're on the the yellow zone kind of thing [ah] is it
[oh] no there's a difference you know you you you you cannot use the [ah] #ang moh# ones
ya ya ya result
<malay>sebab</malay> [ah] asian <malay>dengan</malay>
white guys different [ah]
in terms of what lean body mass
ya
I mean we just evolved from different monkeys [lah] I guess
[ah] I don't think there's a big difference between malay and chinese
you know
[ah] wait wait wait wait
[eh] wait wait
what were they talking about [ah]
that [one]
okay okay
wait wait [ah] <malay>kau</malay> sixty one right
okay how how how tall are you
one six seven let me
[eh] brother you are at low risk good job
[ah] ya your is twenty one point nine
[orh] without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the [one] doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference [ah]
according to this my is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but I used to but I think (um) I think a couple of months ago I was
I was I was a bit of a
in a chonky
kind of situation <malay>aku macam</malay> I was eighty six kilo [sia]
I think my my highest
my my my my peak [ah]
peak
no
my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos [jer]
right
I
I think I know which [one] you're talking about like the picture
sugar a is an addiction
<malay>aku</malay> used to have an issue about eating [ah] I don't why like I I was constantly <malay>lapar</malay> like hungry
<malay>macam lapar gila</malay>
but you eat you wake up in the morning <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
ravenous <malay>nak mampus</malay>
!huh! !huh! !huh!
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
(mm)
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it [ah]
ya
alright
in law no not yet so [ah] cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
[ah] german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course [ah] and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so (um) it's like things to do if the if (uh) for you know respiratory things [ah]
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing (uh) this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time [ah] he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit #siao# also
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I think they were doing like is
[ah] quarterly report or something [lah]
<malay>pasal dorang punya</malay>
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message [ah]
saying that you know
(um) good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email [ah]
then then at then a while ago were like complaining [ah] how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
[ah] then
he will he told me he told me that first [ah] that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay [ah] this old man might might have been repeating his story again
<malay>macam</malay> no no no
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two [ah]
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like [oh] why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else [lah] right
then said no
he got COVID
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> yo
what the fuck
is it <malay>dah macam</malay> you know like
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
(um) the initial thing was
they wanted to get married [ah] this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents [lah] of course
no it's not so much #muz# [ah] #muz# <malay>macam</malay>
it's usually like a like a mother thing [lah] like
ya this kind of
ya so (um) and then what you call it [ah] then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that (uh) he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
so he was first I said okay but it was that kind of okay <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>suka hati</malay> [ah] you know that kind of thing
[ah] kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues <malay>pasal</malay>
islam [ah]
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it !woo! you can go on for like this [ah] but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it [lah] then I'm like
<malay>aku pun nak</malay> join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've (um) contemplated about [lah] some of them <malay>macam</malay> not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is <malay>zakat</malay>
<malay>dia macam cakap</malay> [oh] it doesn't feel transparent
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also [lah] I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
[eh] you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy [what]
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
<malay>betul</malay> [ah] that's what #fahim# adhere
so
ya so anyway then (um)
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
#wuhan# flu and all that
[ah] chinese cough as they say
and then (err)
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and (um)
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow [ah] from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved [ah] which is fair
ya [lah] of course [lah] you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay [ah] mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up [ah]
then (uh)
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
[ah] and they were kind of
having some progress [ah] but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause (uh) [kan] they both work from home
like
(uh) my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
(um)
ya then [ah] he goes over to his place a lot cause (uh) K so my my parents live in #bedok# south right which is
basically near #tanah merah# right
then he lives at the condo at #tanah merah#
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once [pe]
ya
so she goes over there like every other day [ah] to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
[ah] okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya [sia] ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it [lah]
one of those guys
ya
and then [ah] she's there like every other day then (um) that day I kind of went to meet my mum
no not my family dinner at <malay>simpang</malay> [kan]
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of [eh] why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about (uh) that issue like my sister
(um) being over there [lah] what
and saying how [oh]
<malay>sebagai orang islam</malay>
[ah] <malay>aku dah</malay>
my mum
then
<malay>aku dengar tu aku dah macam</malay> (oo)
<malay>bulu</malay>
<malay>roma dah</malay> stand at attention
so I <malay>kau jangan cakap gini</malay> [ah]
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do [ah]
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
<malay>macam</malay> you cannot expect a marriage now [what] doesn't make sense right
so the best thing to do
ya [lah] exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
just the show <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time [ah] he talked to me and (uh) he brought me out for beers
[oh] he <malay>ajak</malay> me again like today's friday but <malay>aku macam</malay>
[ah] I've got things to do [ah]
ya so I didn't
what
[oh] no no <malay>aku</malay> have
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course [lah] so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones [lah] it's just to like you know
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit <malay>kau tahu</malay>
[ah] ya
so anyway (um) what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
[ah] at first if his parents have some reservations [ah] about him
going out with a malay asian girl [ah]
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no [ah] [ah] !whoa! this just !whoa! !whoa! that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like [ah] muslim countries [lah] right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
this makes sense <malay>aku aku faham</malay>
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way [tau]
was it (mm)
australia [eh] <malay>tak</malay>
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first [lah]

K
<malay>nak cakap pasal</malay>
<malay>azam baru dengan</malay> veganism
(mm) (mm)
(mm) <malay>mungkin dalam</malay>
<malay>dalam masa</malay>
<malay>tiga bulan</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> depend <malay>juga</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> have <malay>ada</malay> deteriorate <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>atau</malay>
(mm)
<malay>atau ada apa-apa yang mengubah persepsi dalam</malay> morality
depends [lah] you <malay>rasa macam mana</malay>
<malay>tapi macam ada</malay> standpoint morality
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay>
opinion
[oh] <malay>sebab tu rasa</malay> selfish [ah]
(mm) <malay>itu dia panggil</malay> cognitive dissonance (err) basically
<malay>bila</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat</malay> certain <malay>negara</malay>
some of them
<malay>ada yang makan anjing</malay>
you <malay>boleh tengok dekat</malay> YouTube
<malay>ada yang</malay>
<malay>yang buat video dia tengah makan anjing macam yang video orang korea selalu buat dia</malay> [kan] <malay>makan makanan</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi kat situ kelakar</malay> [tau] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kita boleh nampak</malay> dislike <malay>pada video orang yang makan anjing tu banyak tapi bila dia makan</malay> steak <malay>biasa</malay>
beef
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] like <malay>lepas tu korang</malay> comments <malay>semua yang elok-elok</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap sedap</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi bila yang anjing tu ramai yang</malay> dislike then <malay>bagi</malay> comment
<malay>yang marah</malay> [lah] <malay>marah sebab makan anjing tapi kat situ macam mana dia agak</malay>
hypocrite [kan] (mm)
(mm) <malay>sebenarnya tu memang</malay> argument <malay>yang orang selalu pakai</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi dekat situ timbul satu</malay> problem <malay>macam mana</malay> intelligence <malay>satu</malay> sentient being <malay>diukur macam mana dia orang</malay> measure
so <malay>dah jadi satu</malay> problem <malay>kat situ</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>rasa</malay> (mm) morally <malay>memang kita salah</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau nak ikut daripada</malay> standpoint moral
<malay>cuma</malay>
I <malay>suka juga tengok daripada satu</malay>
<malay>daripada satu</malay> (uh)
evolutionary standpoint <malay>yang mana</malay>
<malay>kita dah dah</malay> mutated <malay>dah</malay> evolved
<malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk makan</malay>
sentient being <malay>lain</malay> though so <malay>dah</malay> in a way <malay>dah</malay> adapt <malay>sebab tu bila kita cuma nak tinggalkan</malay>
<malay>tinggalkan</malay>
(mm) tradition <malay>bukan</malay> tradition <malay>tinggalkan</malay> diet <malay>tu dia bagi kesan sampingan pada badan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab banyak juga</malay>
<malay>orang-orang yang</malay> ex-vegan <malay>yang dah</malay>
ten years being vegan
last <malay>sekali dia orang</malay>
<malay>dia orang tinggalkan juga</malay> veganism <malay>sebab</malay>
health <malay>semakin teruk</malay> [kan]
(mm)
[ah] in fact <malay>baru</malay> five thousand years <malay>dari</malay> ya <malay>yang yang</malay> recorded [lah] five thousand years <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] agriculture
before that <malay>takde yang dikenal pasti</malay> [lah]
<malay>itu masa</malay> mesopotamia [kan]
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> I <malay>akan</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> vegetarian <malay>dulu sebab macam biasa</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>ramai orang yang cakap benda yang sama dia tak boleh tinggalkan</malay> cheese
<malay>telur</malay> yes yes <malay>tak boleh</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
last <malay>kita makan</malay> beef <malay>pun bila</malay>
mac D [lah]
[a'ah] [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kira itu tahun lepas punya cerita ini sekarang tahun baru</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>tapi kita</malay> [kan] <malay>pernah</malay> discuss <malay>sebelum ni kalau macam susah</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>kalau tak nak nampak poyo kita kena buat buat ada macam</malay> health issue <malay>macam ada</malay> allergy <malay>ke makan makan</malay> meat products
<malay>ada</malay> allergy <malay>jadi kita boleh pura-pura ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> illness [ah] <malay>ada penyakit yang tak boleh yang membuatkan kita tak boleh</malay>
<malay>makan daging</malay>
[oh] ya [lah] <malay>rasa serba salah rasa</malay> guilty <malay>dia dah masak</malay> [kan]
I was many <malay>tak tahu pun</malay>
just just <malay>fikir bila dah tengok banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak</malay> debate
then <malay>dia macam dia</malay> start to make sense [lah] <malay>bila</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay>
discussion <malay>pasal</malay> morality issues
(mm) back then I consider <malay>juga</malay> standpoint <malay>yang lagi satu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang memang</malay>
<malay>kalau ikutkan daripada</malay> organism <malay>yang pertama pun memang dia</malay>
<malay>menelan satu sama lain agaknya</malay>
even plants <malay>pun</malay> evolve <malay>daripada</malay> organism <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> first
(mm)
mostly <malay>pasal</malay> philosophy <malay>yang mana yang mana</malay> start
start into into <malay>betul pun lepas</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay>
start pandemic
and <malay>jadi banyak masa untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> reflect
<malay>untuk fikir</malay> (err) meaning of life
and then <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] (err)
<malay>macam-macam</malay>
argument <malay>macam-macam</malay> discussion <malay>dapat</malay>
<malay>dapat tengok sebab</malay> free <malay>sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak</malay> free time <malay>masa</malay> pandemic <malay>ni</malay>
so <malay>daripada situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni</malay>
<malay>macam dulu tak boleh dengar pun sebenarnya bila orang</malay>
<malay>bincangkan pasal</malay> veganism
<malay>dia macam selalu</malay> irritating [kan] annoying <malay>macam mana</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (err) recently [lah] <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>nampak</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa dia</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> make sense
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya [lah] source of protein <malay>tu senang nak dapat</malay> ya especially is <malay>buat tempeh</malay> [lah]

alright [jer] (mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> still once in a while <malay>memang rasa</malay> craving <malay>untuk</malay>
(err) beef too especially <malay>bila bayangkan</malay> steak
(um) <malay>yang</malay> medium rare [ah]
<malay>sedap</malay>
<malay>kat situ</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> problem <malay>tu dia kita ni</malay>
<malay>bunuh</malay> other sentient being <malay>untuk bagi</malay> pleasure <malay>pada</malay> taste bud <malay>kita</malay> (mm) <malay>ada juga orang yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> counter <malay>balik dia cakap</malay> okay and then <malay>macam mana</malay> handling <malay>dengan nyamuk macam mana dengan</malay> (err) <malay>lipas</malay>
<malay>takkan kita tak boleh nak bunuh</malay> [kan]
(err) <malay>dekat situ itu persoalan yang lain</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia orang</malay> invasive <malay>macam lipas nyamuk ni</malay> invasive so <malay>dia bukan macam</malay>
(err) <malay>lembu lembu kita</malay> factory farm and then <malay>kita bagi dia</malay> life <malay>yang teruk</malay> just for the sake <malay>untuk dapatkan</malay>
product just for the sake <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk makan dia</malay>
[ah] [ha] <malay>sebab lembu tu dia tak pernah kacau orang pun dia tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>masuk rumah</malay> and then <malay>hisap darah ke</malay>

<malay>tapi pun ada juga yang yang</malay> certain vegan <malay>yang memang sampai</malay> to the extremes <malay>dia orang tak bunuh nyamuk</malay> they just <malay>tiup</malay> [jer] a lot <malay>macam tu jadi</malay> [ah] <malay>yang tu</malay> extreme <malay>sangat</malay> #kot#
(mm)
I mean <malay>kalau kalau kalau</malay> creature <malay>lain</malay> human <malay>ke</malay> animal <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>kalau dia</malay> start <malay>untuk</malay> invade <malay>tu kita ada</malay> right <malay>untuk ni</malay> [lah] self-defence [lah]

<malay>yang biasa-biasa</malay> [jer] [lah]
something like that [lah] [ah] if not at work I'll be at home [lah] you know the the deal right [ah]

[ah]
ya I I got said already ya
[ah] it is
compared the zoo they pay more but they and their shift is also slightly shorter [lah]
but (err) I would say the experience there is (err) pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of <malay>macam</malay> tourists
(err) you have a lot of fun [lah] especially with like your co-workers
but the the thing about challenger is different people works for different shift so
you you meet new people [lah] every time you work
so the
I feel <malay>macam</malay> the camaraderie is is very ya
at the zoo [lah]
(mm)
ya you know you know started from the bottom [lah] then now ya how are you I

[ah] ya <malay>hal ehwal masing-masing</malay> [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
I mean I don't really make a lot of friends in school I mean because of the university [ah] environment [lah] like you know people come from different backgrounds and we have different timetables so
we don't really get to see each other that often but I do have one or two few friends [lah] that I I'm actually looking forward to meeting
and (err) catching up [lah]

after after graduating [lah] from the university
I almost there [lah] I feel that already ya
ya [oh] ya then [ah] how's your your dad's [ah] youtube channel <malay>ada masa</malay> upload upload videos <malay>tak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>betul</malay>
[orh]
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's (err) respectable [lah] for the craft of
ya
(mm)
ya understandable [lah]
[oh] ya ya she she's I think five months
so you expect the baby to appear at [eh] appear [eh] they expect for the baby to be born [lah] in (err) <malay>dalam</malay> late november <malay>begitu</malay>
so
ya all of us are pretty excited [lah] <malay>kita</malay> even <malay>macam dah buat</malay> a baby shower (um) [eh] not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone <malay>punya</malay> spirits [lah] given ya this <malay>macam</malay> hard
time right
ya and I and my <malay>kakak</malay> #wen# is the
<malay>anak pertama</malay> [lah] to carry a child for the family
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited [ah]
ya
[oh] true true
so ya my my mother and my (uh) brother-in-law <malay>punya</malay> mother both of them plan out [lah] the this party for us
so <malay>harap harap</malay> (err) it's going to be fun (err) it's gonna happen I think [ah] early next month also
near #sharmin's# birthday I think
ya her mother will <malay>masak makanan</malay> for us and then after that my mum will plan out <malay>dia punya</malay> games and
(err) <malay>aktiviti-aktiviti</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita akan buat</malay> on that day itself
nah who who who I mean
(mm) government [lah] they will know that is more than the allowed number [ah] so
ya it's going to be a small one [lah] only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
the government <malay>punya pantang larang</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti ikut</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> respect respectable [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
<malay>malu</malay> [lah]
(um)
[ah] ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
because she can still (err) go to work [lah] but her <malay>macam orang atas</malay> don't want her to come
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool [lah] cause they really understands (uh) their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce [ah] in the future we work
[ah] [ah] ya he's doing fine [lah] (um)
because he works at the port right so he helps (err) he is a I think I think he's an engineer then <malay>dia tolong macam pasang</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau ada</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> equipment <malay>yang rosak</malay>
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time [lah] because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during (err) everyday day to day operations ya
(mm)
ya ya ya my my dad [ah] cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed [lah] beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he <malay>macam gembira</malay> [ah] like !wow! finally he get a job [ah]
cause he's been doing delivery at the site [ah] to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
(err) [ah] school (err) <malay>apa tu yuran</malay> ya <malay>yuran sekolah</malay> unlike us [lah] for for
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
(mm)
ya school fee is quite expensive
(mm) I think really does a good job [lah] in ensuring that (uh) local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years (err) no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level [seh] ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five [ah]
(mm)
my sorry what
[oh] my girlfriend [ah] [oh] she's she's fine [lah] because [ah] she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it [lah] how [ah] it's very interesting
then <malay>dia orang tayangkan</malay> the whole thing on (err) facebook live
so they will (err) how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
so they will be like [oh] [ah] school of engineering <malay>dekat bawah</malay> [jer] <malay>nama-nama dia punya</malay> students ya in that slow
ya ya in that type of (uh)
effect ya format ya
[ah] facebook facebook live
then (uh) she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her (uh) school of (uh)
mathematics
(err) they had a zoom
so in that zoom session <malay>dia orang ada buat macam</malay> lucky draw [lah] so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods (err) jabra elite mostly <malay>macam</malay> those school technology gadgets [lah]
ya <malay>dia lagi sikit menang</malay> [seh] she said (err) she said (err) the one that wins ya it's usually like either <malay>dua ke atas dua ke bawah</malay> so
what they found out from her name [ah]
ya
I mean [ah] aren't we all sore losers some days [ah]
[oh] (uh) it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
[ah] she went out [lah] with her family cause (err)
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
I actually ordered (err) ice cream <malay>untuk dia</malay> so like
ya then <malay>kat rumah</malay> I think got no one so (uh) ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure [lah] cause the number is
[ah] the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her [lah] but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that <malay>dia balik sebelum</malay>
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
so <malay>mana tahu</malay> [ah] got <malay>nasib</malay> [ah] time <malay>tujuh</malay> then <malay>baru hantar</malay>
I can request [lah] I mean the idea of contactless [kan] but
(uh) I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible [lah] because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up
so (uh)

the <malay>daerah</malay> canberra
so ya like when we were still freshies on the fire ground it was a bit scary [lah] because we don't know what to expect
meanwhile they told us in training is <malay>lain</malay> what from what you are going experience real life
ya but honestly the he is a really good good buddy [lah] to have when it comes to firefighting
ya
ya I'm I'm sure you have the same
experience when you what serving your time as the police right
what what what what you doing [ah] in police
[oh] [oh] so so you so you were like <malay>macam</malay> patrolman [lah] <malay>gitu ronda-ronda</malay> around the area
[ah]
the (err)
okay
[oh]
ya [lah]
!wah! they are not worrying [ah] like you I mean do you get calls often or <malay>macam takde masalah ke</malay> in the area
[oh] (err) I mean like since you are posted in a the area <malay>macam tak ramai orang</malay> [kan] so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
(um)
[oh]
understand [lah]
understand understand
ya I had I had a lot of fun in yes
<malay>macam tak</malay> pressure [lah] <malay>orang tak</malay> I don't feel <malay>macam orang</malay> bully you or anything
ya
[ah] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>hibur-hiburkan</malay> [lah] so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
you know that it was just the that's a wrong day [lah] wrong time
(mm)
ya true true
ya well how you spend the rest of your day man
[oh] <malay>lari-lari anak</malay> around area

<malay>macam</malay> the only only time I ran <malay>jauh gitu</malay> is back when I was in serving my [lah] they make us run around #ubin#
(mm)
ya correct [lah] true true
[ah]
that's not bad
ya
and I think that's the way [lah] <malay>macam orang tak tahu</malay> you cannot drink a lot <malay>kalau nak minum sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>kalau boleh jangan minum</malay> at all
(uh) <malay>habis</malay>
thirty minutes <malay>baru</malay> [jer] <malay>minum</malay> that that's the ideology that
I don't know [lah] but that's what I see [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya
I see [ah] is is you want it you want to drink just to quest [eh] quench your thirst but not to
(mm)
ya cause I I got I make [lah] this (err) module in back when I was in my first year university
ya it's about biology larh and then [oh] <malay>ada</malay> mention <malay>yang</malay> if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
making your performance worse than if you
control your drinking [lah]
which is true [lah] ya cause they also mentioned that actually heatstroke [eh] no sorry not heatstroke on the heatstroke I think [ah] ya heatstroke ya heatstroke it's not because you don't drink too much
it's because
you know [eh]
ya
ya it it can be that and also you didn't <malay>ni</malay> [lah] (um) [ah] wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so <malay>kita tak boleh kita tak boleh</malay> push too much [lah] <malay>nanti orang cakap</malay> [kan]
correct [lah] correct
(mm)
ya ya true
but okay [lah] I mean now at least the general public has the idea [lah] that
(mm)
K [lah]
ya
drinking
[oh] [ah] nah man I
I kind of stopped drinking [ah] so
how about you man
ya ya that's nice that's nice
I
apple juice [eh]
but ya <malay>berapa banyak</malay> juice you <malay>suka minum</malay> in one day <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh]
okay true [lah] because like for me <malay>macam</malay> I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks [kan] <malay>macam air air air yang</malay> sweet <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>boleh mendatangkan kencing manis</malay> so
ya so (uh) at home <malay>pun</malay> I only got <malay>air masak</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> most of the time the only [ah] the best alternative would definitely be juices [ah]
so
I will go for orange juices and carrot juice but my favorite juice will be the
[ah] lime juice [ah]
[oh] no I don't like to buy all these <malay>macam</malay> manufactured <malay>punya</malay> cause I feel <malay>macam dia tak mendatangkan</malay> any
(err) well
<malay>apa tu</malay> benefit [lah] so I <malay>selalu beli pergi pasar</malay> then I <malay>beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan</malay>
[ah] <malay>biji biji buah-buahan</malay> then I <malay>balik</malay> I <malay>potong</malay> I blend
then I <malay>letak air</malay> then I <malay>minum</malay> [ah]
ya my
it's right way ya my <malay>ni</malay> if you if you if you if you got the time my <malay>ni</malay> always recommend [lah] when you blend [kan] you blend <malay>dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali</malay>
[ah] <malay>dengan kulit-kulit dia</malay> but the <malay>biji</malay> the <malay>biji</malay> you take out
okay [lah] the <malay>kulit</malay> (err)
how to say [ah] mine gonna like (err)
if you blend enough right the the whole drink will will come in well [lah] smooth
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>apa dia apa</malay> I heard some fruits [eh] if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good [lah] <malay>jadi kena macam pandai-pandai</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya [oh] [eh] grapefruit <malay>dengan</malay> grape is <malay>lain</malay> [eh] <malay>tak sama</malay> [eh]
grapefruit <malay>dengan</malay> grape <malay>dia orang tak sama</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> two different fruits [ah] <malay>lain</malay> [kan]
[oh]
grapefruit [ah]
<malay>siapa</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> come out [eh] <malay>nama-nama ni</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]

(mm) correct correct

#stalisha#
my day today is very tiring obviously (um) it's been two days [ah] I sleep very late
<malay>dalam pukul enam pagi</malay>
because I started a business selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> yes
(um) and so far it's been well (um) it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring [lah]
basically because I like to eat <malay>tahu begedil</malay>
(um) quite recently [eh] [ah] like last month [ah] late last month when <malay>tahu begedil</malay> was was like a trend
(um) it's among the home-based sellers [lah]
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
(um) <malay>tahu begedil</malay> and they both
have their
<malay>apa tu macam ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya kesedapan tu</malay> [kan] ya
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
for a while because <malay>ibu</malay> force me to
but (um) making this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> of course I only started recently
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
(um) [eh] I mean there were no <malay>macam kedai</malay> taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
[ah] [ah]
customers [ah]
yes
delivery is
(um) by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya [ah] so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight [lah] hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
(um)
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
[ah] I have school I have (um) freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
so I think [ah] this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I will only sell <malay>bila ada</malay> time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> holidays
ya
go [ah] because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change [lah] because I like to bake also
so maybe like maybe the next week is not <malay>tahu begedil</malay> it's like
(um) brownies or cookies something like that
branding
[oh] I didn't call I didn't name it but <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> named it as
#tahbegs# #tahbegs#
ya it's #tahbegs# is from #tahu# and #begedil# but we make it very hipster
so it's #tahbegs#
ya T H B E G S
[oh] ya (um) I also own a small business selling #bawals#
<malay>bawal</malay> yes <malay>tudung bawal</malay> you know there's square scarf
[eh] it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be [eh] next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
(um) one is the our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk <malay>bawal</malay> and our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> it sells
(um) better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
[ah] because (um) me and my partner [lah]
ya we we
<malay>kita suka</malay> try <malay>benda</malay> like try to do things new things and we try to ya [lah]
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
we hustle a lot <malay>macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau hari-hari kerja</malay>
<malay>asalkan</malay> like <malay>kita boleh rasa duit tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] #inshallah# !wah! <malay>untuk</malay> [ah] <malay>benda yang halal</malay>
twenty one
that young
[oh]
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
that's the best you can sleep
[oh] okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
[oh] (mm) [ah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay
(uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
I you like wrapped
[oh] like <malay>mati macam melayu</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
[oh] my god
they didn't pay you
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] I see
(um)
what am I doing at nineteen
(um) I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
(um)
there was this
<malay>apa tu</malay> open casting for new models
and then (um) I was very camera shy last time
like <malay>tak suka ambil gambar</malay> and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a <malay>hijabi</malay> model
so I'm like [meh] like I I don't even bother [lah] but then my partner saw like [eh] you should try [lah] you just try then [orh]
I said no I don't want (err) I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the (um) the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
[ah] he applied to two [ah] company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
[ah] it was an unpaid job
for
(um) until I was maybe
(um) nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
(um)
by their apparel
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't <malay>simpan</malay> because the quality is like shit
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like (um) the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
and then I come back with just a piece of <malay>tudung</malay> for me it's like <malay>merepek</malay> so
(err) when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
<malay>ibu</malay> (um)
tell me [lah] like [oh] you need to start
(um) charging these people because you are having a lot of (um)
<malay>apa ni</malay> (um) shops coming to you (uh) for shooting she said then okay [lah] I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
and #alhamdulillah# it also went well
[ah]
people also come to me (um) to do to create <malay>apa</malay> to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
(um) sell their products [ah]
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
I don't know whatever <malay>barang</malay> that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried (uh) an influencer before to boost start my (um) Kamash (um) the <malay>tudung</malay> brand
(uh) and it didn't work [ah]
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because [ah] her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales [lah] so I was like okay (um) actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they (um) they really spread the word and tag you know
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
other companies ya
(mmhmm)
usually (um) before we post something right for the company we also like send the
<malay>apa tu</malay> our
what do they call it
okay [lah] the context [ah] the context of the post [ah] we
ya the description we always like (um) send it
to the company first let them approve <malay>apa-apa macam</malay> if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people [ah] <malay>macam tambah-tambah</malay> [lah] [ah] themselves and then they
then they send back to us then <malay>baru kita</malay> copy paste and then put
[ah] on our post
(uh) it's our post because we are like (um) ya
usually is like that
[ah] no that that's the thing that's why I don't (um) I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like (um) they told me [lah] like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
(um) is very difficult
(um) and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle [lah] but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school (um) there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson (um) end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night [lah] something like that
ya it's like it's very bad [lah] is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up (uh) my own company [ah]
selling clothes selling <malay>muslimah</malay> clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
(um)
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
!alamak! we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
(mm)
because all of this (um) of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
(um) creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well [lah] and
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] you need to do your research (err) do survey do prototype everything
(uh) (uh)
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
(um) sellers <malay>terdahulu biasa</malay> about <malay>apa yang dorang suka</malay> instead of what
their customers like
you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay> they
assume that [orh] <malay>aku suka ni</malay> so confirm <malay>orang lain akan suka</malay>
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face [lah] when I'm opening this (um) Kamash
<malay>pasal</malay> (um) a lot of people say [eh] <malay>ni lawa</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> but we cannot hear what our family members really (um) say we need to reach out to people
(um)
yes
and
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum [ah] she said like [orh] <malay>ni</malay> colour <malay>cantik</malay> everything whatever shit
but then actually <malay>salah</malay> [ah] it's not selling our first
out first what [ah] [ah]
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
simple <malay>macam</malay> not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful <malay>tapi</malay> a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like [eh] [eh] <malay>ni mana ada orang pakai</malay> cotton <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> but it sell out like a lot (um) we bought I'm ten colours
eight colours already sold out
ya
[ah] we manufacture ourself
[ah] no (uh) we liaise with a factory in #jakarta#
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
(mm)
no [lah] I mean like obviously (uh) when you grow up
[eh]
[ah] my god okay it needs to switch
naturally (um)
<malay>bila dah membesar</malay> right <malay>sambil membesar</malay>
ya <malay>sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar</malay> [tau] <malay>apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka</malay>
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then <malay>ibu tak suka</malay> so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
(um) she said [oh] you know (um) <malay>macam</malay> she tell told me all the negative things [lah] all the
cons about being a nurse
and then [ah]
it's like <malay>jaga mayat</malay> <malay>jaga mayat</malay> and then like
some personal reasons [lah] for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
but of course <malay>ibu</malay> also <malay>tak kasi</malay> because she say I will <malay>mati cepat</malay> the I'm like <malay>kalau ajal tu ada mati</malay> [lah] I mean like we cannot
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] like
those type of
incident
car crash [eh] plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee [what]
and
ya [lah] exactly then I was like okay sure
so [ah] basically [ah]
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what <malay>ibu</malay> wants me to do [lah]
so I'm like okay [lah] since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
(um) ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor [orh] an acting
[orh] okay [ah] clown doctor
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
[oh] okay
(uh)
I can fix my own teeth
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
ya
[oh] my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
[eh] the first ya your first show is it
is the <malay>hantu</malay> remember
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little <malay>masih kecil</malay> [kan] that time
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like !wah!
well quite nice [lor]
so
ya
but it was good though
(mm)
[oh] I see
[oh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
ya that's that's the thing
(um) usually people are afraid to set a price
(um)
we calculate our expenses [ah] and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see [lah] (um) like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like [oh] we can sell it from this price to this price no (uh) no lower than that
if it's lower than that (um) means
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>aku rugi</malay> [lah] (mm) (mm)
obviously <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like [oh] I need to to control myself because
<malay>dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> okay <malay>aku tak boleh tak makan</malay> but if I can
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not #chai# I don't like #chai#
[oh] really
[oh] I see
[ah] [ah]
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
[oh] my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
[oh] okay you thinking far
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I don't know [ah] I feel like
even if people <malay>bila</malay>
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
[oh] ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge (um) washing machine
!wow! such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in [what] and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
<malay>silat</malay> ya but then we stop because like (um)
the <malay>penjuru</malay> is it the guru the head of the <malay>silat</malay> or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he <malay>campur</malay> with
<malay>benda tak elok</malay> [lah] (um) with
<malay>jin</malay> yes
no sister his sister <malay>yang ini kat luar</malay> I it was at #sengkang# it was at #sengkang# you know those <malay>macam</malay> got court badminton court ya we <malay>silat</malay> there
and then like I was training at
one point of time <malay>macam tengah buat benda sendiri</malay> [ah] and then like
<malay>tapi</malay> like I saw this <malay>guru</malay> and this student like a teenage student
(um) <malay>tengah terbaring</malay> [tau]
and then
the guru is like <malay>macam gitu macam baca-baca</malay> then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like (um) like what <malay>macam dia sakit ke</malay> I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person <malay>rasuk</malay> [lah] <malay>katakan</malay>
ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's (um)
one of our uncle also was in the same <malay>silat</malay> with us <malay>siapa tu</malay> [ah] #ariff# [ah] he quitted first and then we quit
so ya
I feel like is a traditional (err) okay (um) one thing I learned about <malay>silat</malay> while doing my research for my last time was
the their <malay>silat</malay> is actually
(um) how to say [ah]
they hold their respect [lah] towards their opponent
[a'ah] <malay>tekan</malay>
like how to say (um) okay <malay>selalunya sekarang orang kat luar</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang gaduh</malay> [kan] <malay>dia rembat</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu</malay> when they are in a battle
(um) they <malay>tunjuk</malay> respect to one another first and they you know <malay>buka bunga</malay> is where you show like [oh] are you ready
to <malay>silat</malay> then ya
ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
like are ready to like [ah] I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
last time they really gold the <malay>adat</malay> [lah]
various [lah] <malay>silat</malay> #taekwando#
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman
ya
(um)
but
ya
so you literally need to fly
you need to like jump and like
[oh] okay okay okay I can see
(mm)
counselling
no
for who for kids
[oh]
ya
no violent cause
no
!huh!
(uh huh)
cannot two weeks [ah]
ya
as long as you <malay>belah</malay> after two weeks [ah] I don't mind
<malay>lama</malay>
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
like being straightforward it's like just say [lah] like [oh] <malay>apa</malay> I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
but to them I say [oh] okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
like (uh) <malay>aku akan ambil macam angkat</malay> [ah] <malay>baju-baju kotor ni</malay> but some people see it as rude <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
(uh) so <malay>macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kena buat semua benda</malay> [ah] <malay>kat rumah ni</malay>
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know [eh]
ya the <malay>melayu</malay> so formal I cannot
[ah] no we only speak it when <malay>ada</malay> oral <malay>ke</malay>
!wah! that was so long time ago
<malay>melayu</malay>
with <malay>abang</malay>
<malay>biasanya</malay> with <malay>abang</malay> or <malay>ibu</malay> a bit [lah] <malay>macam gini</malay> [lah] like transition between english and malay but for #hilah# hundred percent english
ya and !wow! her malay is just
I think her malay is very formal
ya
ya
(uh)
[ah] I also don't know [eh] but (um) one of my friends like <malay>dia sekarang dalam</malay> uni and he is a
he major in journalist <malay>bahasa melayu</malay> [lah] so
when I see his works he !wah! like
I feel like
I don't know malay at all because it's another
language ya <malay>macam ada perkataan</malay> like <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so <malay>macam</malay> I feel like
<malay>bahasa melayu ni</malay> is not for today [lah]
it's more of
<malay>orang dulu-dulu</malay> because <malay>orang dulu</malay>
<malay>macam bahasa baku</malay> [kan]
ya correct
it's
like singlish [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we don't usually speak like this but
along the way people <malay>macam</malay> get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of <malay>dekat kau kena</malay>
did you like
<malay>lima minit</malay> short <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah]
okay I can stop it already [ah]

<malay>kena</malay> expand
(mm)
do it [lah]
(mm)
I heard
the <malay>wuduk</malay> area now they <malay>dia orang taruh apa</malay> sanitizer
[oh] no [ah]
[oh] okay okay [oh] so they they
they close off the area [ah]
because then again it's a
to prevent the spread of
the water borne infections [ah]
(mm)
so then that means <malay>salam pun tak boleh</malay> [ah]
[ah] okay okay
the gentle gentle tap [lah] at the knuckles
speculation [lah]
situations ya
I mean
ya
<malay>orang</malay> only the <malay>orang atas</malay> would know [lah] all what is set in stone [lah]
ya
[oh]
yes
[oh]
suggestions [lah]
(mm) I would say I've only been out a few times for work and
ya I didn't get get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
and that one <malay>pun</malay> mostly <malay>kat</malay> my
housing area
ya
ya so it's the same old <malay>kedai kopi</malay> and (err) you know the mall right ya
ya
ya the standard breakfast <malay>punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng</malay>
ya
ya
ya that's why bro I've been meaning to on that [ah]
[oh] ya I did (err) the west ham versus watford right
[oh] my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
(mm)
[ah] okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that <malay>macam dah</malay> second nature [kan] <malay>ambil wuduk</malay>
(um)
ya I mean
it's quite impressive [ah] that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years [ah]
[oh] <malay>cik jamal</malay> [oh] I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest <malay>punya</malay> supporter
[oh] at any pressure [lah]
(mm)
but ya [lah] I I think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him [lah] cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
I'm quite happy [sia] for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya (mm) I would say they are doing fine now
but I'm just just stress [ah] bro for the last last two games [ah]
cause you <malay>punya</malay> opponent (mm)
ya correct correct
mid table but <malay>kalau menang</malay> the last two matches then
confirm qualify [ah] europa europa
ya champions league [dah]
<malay>dah tak boleh dah</malay>
a bit out of reach [ah] ya <malay>jauh sangat</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] so that's that [lah]
quite sad [lah] cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya that is expected of them [lah]
ya so
<malay>tu yang</malay> quite disappointing [ah]
but (uh) you know you know football just football [lah]
it just a game so
(mm)
ya
correct correct this [ah] can't be predicted [lah]
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
(um) win [ah] so <malay>syabas</malay> to them
yes
(mm)
true true true
ya
[oh] ya speaking of liverpool right so how is (uh) your good our good friend [ah] #havi#
ya
[oh]
[oh] the usual springleaf or the #prata# place [ah]
(mm)
ya that's true that's true
!wah! so you'll be meeting him later [ah]
[oh] !wow!
ya
that's good that's good
ya just send him my [ah] regards [ah]
(err) like him to know that
I'm always happy for him [lah]
cause this is like first time in
<malay>dua puluh tahun</malay> is it ya liverpool won <malay>punya</malay> premier league
[ah] ya ya ya correct correct
yes yes
(uh) that's amazing
ya now he already ya [sia] he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time [ah]
[ah]
but I will have to say [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> though he quite <malay>semangat</malay> [ah]
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be <malay>melampau</malay> [ah]
how emotion emotional football gets [ah]
(mm)
ya true true
but [oh] wells
is he is he still the regular <malay>kat</malay> your fire station
[oh] so what to to go into full time studies is it
does he does he say the requirement for like what do you call it [ah] the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme [oh] the
something to do with like mature mature student or something [eh]
[oh] james cook (mm)
[ah] okay okay
he but his passion nice [lah]
under him [mah]
(mm)
(mm)
trainings
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm) no doubt [lah] he is really a <malay>budak baik</malay> [lah]
and (uh)
<malay>polis</malay>
ya
ya I was at (err) I was at the and #ang mo kio# over there ya
ya correct correct
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah] you know just
you know drive around the neighbourhood
(mm) do roundings only [ah]
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years [ah]
cause no one from my from my my squad [ah] actually went to the same ya as me
ya so a bit <malay>sedih</malay> [ah]
cause they cause they base you based on your
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I <malay>kena</malay> posted <malay>kat</malay> foxtrot division [ah] <malay>tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat</malay> this area [ah]
sorry sorry can you repeat that again [ah]
(err) didn't get to hear clearly
(mm)
[oh] I would say there's a fair share of calls [lah] there's there's still ongoing back then [lah] (err) but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like <malay>macam</malay> woodlands #jurong#
ya I would say that central area quite tame [mah]
ya
but no doubt [lah] there's always calls here and there [lah] whether their severity <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's like (err) important or not [ah] it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was [ah]
ya but all in all
okay [lah] life
valuable [lah] ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I I feel the same way [ah] as as much as like you know the <malay>berita dia orang</malay> cover and all these cases of
<malay>macam</malay> mismanagement
ya
I think it's isolated <malay>punya</malay> cases
cause
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm)
true true
ya
cause <malay>biasanya macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] usually it's more civilized and laid back [ah] I would say nothing much going on [ah]
ya
but [oh] well that's
it was a good times [ah] back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish (err)
I wish I have plans after this [ah] but sadly I don't
(err) you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this (err) my vicinity [lah]
correct [ah]
[ah]
I usually go for a minimum ten [ah]
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
[kan] <malay>kena</malay> stay active [kan]
ya
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya but I think is <malay>tak susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] but it's
<malay>kena biasakan</malay> so
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
(mm) cause when you when you first start [lah] like after one ten and then usually you <malay>togok air</malay> like <malay>melampau</malay> [ah] but
now I barely need a sip of water [ah]
ya
ya correct
(mm)
ya
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree [ah] [kan] I mean cause <malay>banyak orang banyak orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak begitu</malay> informed [lah] about this kind of stuff [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay>
the
it is the right way [lah] is to <malay>jangan minum banyak</malay> [ah] you have to conserve
cause if you drink too much then later your system
like <malay>macam</malay>
it's it's it's hampered with already [ah] so you need to stay stay clean [ah]
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
<malay>kena</malay> full cool down mode already [ah]
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
(mm)
ya correct correct
heatstroke [ah] heatstroke
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little [lah] it's cause you you <malay>minum melampau</malay> [ah] basically
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] that's true [lah] cause <malay>kalau kau minum banyak</malay> [kan] the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
you more vulnerable to heatstroke [lah]
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
<malay>kau punya badan</malay> is like you know get gets in a shock
(uh) so the more you <malay>biasakan</malay> with more water then the more likely you will
<malay>kenakan</malay> the effects of that heatstroke [ah]
[kan]
<malay>ni semua kena belajar</malay> [ah]
(mm) <malay>yang tepat</malay> [ah]
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
(mm)
ya
well
(uh) I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages [ah] but I've been (uh)
(err) a good a very good consumer of like (err) juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice [ah] yes you as you as you saying
(uh) I would say at least
two bottles [lah]
two bottles (err) five hundred kind [ah]
of juices ya correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
[ah] okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits [ah]
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>biji</malay> [ah] <malay>biji</malay>
<malay>biji-biji kecil</malay> [ah]
!wah!
!wah! that's
I think that's (err) that's the right way to go [ah] to be honest
[ah]
[oh] serious
then
the <malay>biji</malay> take out then you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> but but then
<malay>bila kau minum</malay> [kan]
then is the texture smooth
<malay>kalau</malay>
[oh] do you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> [ah]
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable [lah] but
you need to use a
good blender [lah]
ya I would say that [lah]
ya
but <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>kau kena</malay> like see first [lah] whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars [ah] before <malay>kau tambah</malay> extra sugar or anything [lah] when you blend
[ah]
(mm) true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
with the sugar level already <malay>dah cukup</malay> already
<malay>tak payah tambah</malay> extra stuff
(um)
but as for
(err) grapefruit
(uh) those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit [ah]
ya
so be smooth [ah]
sorry grape
[ah] <malay>lain</malay>
ya different different
(err) grapefruit is <malay>besar sikit</malay>
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
<malay>sama sama</malay> ya
ya it's (uh) <malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
<malay>nama sama tapi</malay>
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut [ah]
(mm)
ya but <malay>kau kena potong</malay> [ah] before you put <malay>dalam</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> blender

(um) very thick
[eh] how

a
like when I do there is like [leh] really I work for two hours then I rest for four hours
but then my rest also <malay>dorang bayar</malay>
then
but then <malay>dorang tak nak ambil</malay> cause I still schooling [ah] then they say like <malay>apa ni</malay>
they want people that can commit more days
means
ya
but actually last sem
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>boleh kerja</malay> [sia]
cause last sem last semester is everything was
so I can while I was working cause it's four hours rest [what]
then <malay>gitu duit masuk</malay> so <malay>senang</malay> [ah] but then wasted [lah] I never think of it [lah]
#al-ameen#
I not sure [seh] I think around
I think until two three like that [ah]
if I not wrong [ah]
ya
<malay>dah lama</malay> [ah] <malay>tak makan sana</malay> because like
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy [ah]
<malay>diam sudah</malay> no [ah] I mean like
if if I'm not exercising already all the more I shouldn't eat there [what] correct or not
ya diet [ah] if cannot cannot exercise then diet [ah]
but I think I want to start back soon [ah] exercising
but <malay>hijrah barang lama</malay> [ah] now the people there all
extreme [ah]
he he he
#faiz# #faiz# <malay>lagi</malay> extreme no I think #faiz# is like the epitome of extreme you know
(mmhmm)
but then I don't know [leh] like I feel like
going to the gym person <malay>pasal</malay> like my friend all say like if I go gym all [ah]
(uh) since I got the height already right
<malay>dorang semua cakap</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> confirm <malay>badan pau punya</malay> [ah]
ya but
the effort [ah] and like
I don't know [eh] I feel like going gym
but gym just very intimidating [ah] like <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>seram</malay> [ah] like go there people all <malay>tengok-tengok semua</malay>
okay
<malay>tak tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi kecil</malay> is okay you know <malay>kecil</malay> cause
like
I don't know [ah] like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
but like if you see <malay>orang gemuk</malay> [kan] <malay>orang gemuk</malay> confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy <malay>semua</malay> [pe]
so but that stigma also like
I don't know [ah] later people <malay>kat</malay> gym <malay>tengok</malay> like [eh] try hard [pe] this guy
a bit
a bit #paiseh# [ah]
but I feel like if I don't start like
forever [sia] <malay>macam gini</malay>
[eh] you know I I looked through my gallery right
like
last time during
I skinny [sia]
okay
not not not skinny [ah] I'm I was skinnier
like I was still big but like
at least I looked proportionate [ah] like don't look so <malay>bulat</malay>
I think hundred and four [ah] (uh) last time I checked was hundred and two
then these days I want to check already but my parents <malay>tak tukar</malay> the battery [ah] for the
weighing scale
so now
I just take as my weight still at hundred and two [ah]
I don't know [eh] my
cause since after right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five [ah]
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
no not really after [ah] after still got a lot of outfields <malay>semua</malay> [pe] so we still <malay>keluar banyak-banyak</malay>
so
not say maintain [lah] but (uh) after can order in already [what] so I always buy #nasi lemak#
<malay>makan banyak</malay> [ah] cause of
ya
then it's cause of [ah] always order in <malay>asyik beli</malay> [jer] then <malay>sekali</malay>
like before I know [ah] like towards the end of [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> getting rounder [ah]
cause army [kan] army the the longer
the longer you are in army right the more <malay>lepak</malay> the
the superiors all will be [ah]
ya
so towards the end is like every week
I eat #nasi lemak# I eat Fatty Bom Bom
[eh]
Fatty Bom Bom free [ah] I want to eat [ah]
[eh]
watch your language man
woodlands have at #marsiling#
no no no no no no it's (uh) you know where #marsiling# is
it's it's opposite #marsiling# [ah] but not to the polyclinic side [tau]
you know you know #marsiling# got new shopping mall the where the police post is
<malay>rumah</malay> ella <malay>kat mana</malay> [eh] [oh] ya ya ya correct correct correct
(uh) (uh) <malay>rumah</malay> ella
<malay>kat belakang</malay> [ah]
towards the tracks
like from <malay>rumah</malay> ella you walk to tracks
then there's a coffee shop there [ah] Fatty Bom Bom <malay>kat sana</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
but what's the difference [seh]
[eh] it doesn't make sense [leh] I mean like okay like <malay>kau tahu</malay> (uh)
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that [one] is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
but then in this case like <malay>abang gemuk</malay> and Fatty Bom Bom no difference [what] both halal already [what]
so like they <malay>tukar nama</malay> for what [sia]
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name [mah] it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know [ah]
but
that time also <malay>ada</malay> [ah]
so like like when I go #lia's# house <malay>senang</malay> [ah]
like if got feels for Fatty Bom Bom [ah] it's just like
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes <malay>sampai</malay> [ah]
no no no it's not at #afghan# there it's at
(uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> #dunman# sec <malay>kat mana</malay>
ya it's opposite #dunman# sec [ah]
then #lia# my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
[ah] <malay>dekat</malay> [ah]
<malay>malas</malay> [pe] <malay>dah cakap malas nak</malay> exercise
like really like it's it's like
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance <malay>yang jauh</malay> it's like
#yio chu kang# to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far [ah]
may half half the journey [ah] from #yio chu kang# to your house
ya but like <malay>macam</malay>
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
confirm <malay>malas</malay> [sia] <malay>nak keluar</malay> it's easier for you to just order
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars [ah]
the
(uh) #tampines# [one] not so bad [eh]
I know
usually me and #lia# buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
but that [one] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
if only <malay>kalau ada</malay> discount [ah]
usually I get the
cajun cajun [eh] cajun cajun chicken [ah]
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice [ah] the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
(uh) then then got the then got the <malay>telur</malay> so it's like more like fried rice like that [lah]
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken [ah]
I never try <malay>abang gemuk</malay> before [ah] so cannot say [ah]
Fatty Bom Bom or FatBoy's
ya
depends [ah] some
you know some of the hawker centre [ah]
the western shop got like secondary school feels [ah]
#Idah's# Kitchen
I don't remember [sia]
is it the one the the thai shop take over [ah]
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
[oh] [oh] [oh]
I that [one] I thought that [one] is korean food [what]
[oh] I don't think I ate there before [ah]
now they got new [one] [ah] at Koufu
but a bit <malay>mahal</malay> [ah] that day I eat it's like six ninety
that kind of price [ah]
(uh) the
the whole range [ah] like you know chicken chop (uh)
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff [ah]
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it [ah]
<malay>pasal dorang</malay> <malay>dorang bagi banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak tapi</malay> even though the portion worth [kan] but I feel like it's like two people portion [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
usually they give like half bowl like that right
but over there they give the full bowl [ah] then the <malay>ayam pun dorang bagi dua</malay>
Koufu you know where the (uh)
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
I think new [ah] the shop <malay>dulu takde</malay> [ah]
but I not too sure [ah] maybe
I don't really remember [ah] because usually <malay>dulu kita orang makan sana</malay>
always <malay>makan</malay> the
japanese shop [kan]
[eh]
how [lah] I want to get better at DOTA [sia]
no [eh] but I play
I play public game like <malay>macam</malay>
always <malay>kena</malay> thrashed [ah]
it's like
if I get toxic opponent [eh] like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good [ah]
maybe [ah] maybe also
but I don't know [ah]
then <malay>aku tunggu kau</malay> download warzone <malay>sampai sekarang belum</malay> download
<malay>kental</malay> [lah]
I don't know [eh] like
I don't know how come your computer <malay>semua</malay> games <malay>tak boleh</malay> [sia]
like
the #genshin# impact also cannot right
but okay [ah] nevermind [ah] because #genshin# like you can't really play with friends [ah] like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode [ah]
like it's more to like <malay>main sendiri</malay>
then you just explore the world yourself [ah]
then
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore [ah]
like cause <malay>dorang ada macam</malay> like a energy system like that
like the call it resin
so
you know [ah] so like (uh) this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge [ah] like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by [lor] then it recharge slowly
then <malay>kau boleh buat</malay> the stuff you need to do [ah]
so it's mostly a waiting game [ah] like you finish
you finish what you need to do already then just <malay>tunggu</malay> [ah]
I don't know [sia] I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
like like really the game play is
fantastic [ah] phenomenal
but
I would say [ah] M I've play [ah] so far
<malay>tapi</malay>
better than runescape [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
like <malay>kau kena tunggu</malay> [ah] resin <malay>kau</malay> fill up <malay>baru kau boleh main</malay>
ya so it's more of a waiting game [ah] so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term [ah]
ya true [ah]
[oh]
console <malay>pun ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay>
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales [ah] they spent <malay>banyak</malay> [ah]
dude <malay>gila</malay> like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
they spent like
like <malay>empat ribu lima ribu</malay>
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
so it's like really luck based [ah] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] your luck <malay>macam mana</malay>
I think maple [ah] cause this [one] is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already [ah]
like I I complete all the story mode already
<malay>pernah pernah</malay> [ah] [ah] last time I buy the skin
ya ya ya it's like DOTA like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like <malay>lima belas</malay> [eh]
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already [ah] like
wasteful [ah] spend <malay>duit kat</malay> game
ya some more it's like
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
like
it it makes a difference but like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak leh nampak sangat</malay> [ah] like you need like
an advantage is advantage [ah] but like they make it minimal [lor]
so <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>kau macam tak</malay> you like don't know me like that [ah]
since when I even watch soccer
(hmm) <malay>sejak bila</malay>
<malay>sejak bila aku tengok bola</malay>
I don't know [ah] like
I never I've never seen the the
what's the word [eh] the
the attractiveness of watching soccer [ah] like it's just
so slow
like <malay>kau</malay> compare <malay>dengan</malay> basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
[a'ah] <malay>tapi tapi bola macam</malay>
you wait pass pass pass I don't know [ah] maybe just not my thing [ah] I guess
<malay>diam sudah</malay>
[eh]
tomorrow tomorrow I got no school [ah]
like I book my <malay>solat jumaat tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dah lama</malay> [sia]
wanted to book [ah]
<malay>tapi tak dapat</malay> [ah]
(mm)
since the booking start I never I never <malay>kena dapat</malay> I think cause I always book late [ah]
so <malay>dah semua</malay> all the slots <malay>dah</malay> fill up [kan] then <malay>dah tak boleh</malay>
<malay>dah tak boleh dapat</malay> slot [ah]
I really not sure [sia]
I think the same week [ah] on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks [ah]
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
[eh] I do tomorrow already
then (uh) <malay>aku tak leh buat</malay> for the next five weeks
[a'ah] so other people can get [ah] but some more <malay>aku selalu tak dapat</malay> [ah]
it
[eh] I think they blacklist me already
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tengok kerusi</malay> all
where you where you (uh) where you plan on getting
APOL
(uh huh) I only know I only know Secret Lab [ah]
(uh) and streamers (uh) <malay>aku tengok</malay> mostly streamers <malay>pakai</malay> the <malay>ini</malay> [ah] Secret Lab [one]
but then the pricing [eh] similar [ah]
<malay>paling murah</malay>
<malay>asal mahal sangat</malay> [sia] it's just a chair right
like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi tapi</malay> even though
<malay>aku bayar banyak-banyak</malay>
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself [what] like it's not genuine leather right
it's leather you know leather actually <malay>murah</malay> [seh]
[ah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
(uh) five hundred dollars on a chair
<malay>kerusi</malay>
(uh huh)
I mean you you said it yourself right like <malay>dorang apa</malay> similar [kan]
!huh!
worth it [ah] got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site [what]
<malay>sama</malay> [ah]
I mean okay warranty <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> one for one exchange or what
<malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> right like
<malay>ada koyak sikit</malay>
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this [one] must ask [ah] I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it [ah]
every other week
<malay>kau ambil pisau kau potong</malay> [seh] already
[oh] really [ah]
okay how about <malay>macam kalau air tumpah</malay>
<malay>air tumpah</malay> on the thing
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but
okay but what if it's like <malay>kau tumpah</malay> [kan] Coke
like you know Coke is very very corrosive right
that time that time <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> (uh) I think
#achap# [ah] #achap# <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> the video
<malay>orang pakai</malay> Coke
<malay>untuk cuci</malay> toilet
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks [ah] like even time <malay>hari raya</malay> [kan]
like
(uh) okay usually guest just [eh] (uh) <malay>tuan rumah dorang selalu</malay> just <malay>tuang</malay> [kan]
F&N [pe] F&N is like the standard [ah] the (mm)
my my <malay>nenek punya</malay> side more of Coke [ah] so they got like
they got like a lot of Coke
like one one what do you call that [eh] (uh) basket
not basket [ah] they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
then another container is all just (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> F&N
ya <malay>hari raya</malay>
so if I go my <malay>nenek</malay> house
it's really just gassy drinks <malay>atau teh</malay>
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea <malay>gitu</malay>
ya different
syrup also not a big fan [ah]
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established [ah]
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons (uh) (uh) the ice lemon tea is the blue colour [one] but they got the
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] the other one <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] <malay>sedap</malay> [ah]
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea [ah] but the blue colour [one] is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness [ah] ya the sugar
<malay>tak tapi</malay> the best [one] I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari</malay> like everywhere I go like most most <malay>kedai tak jual</malay> [ah]
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
it confirm <malay>pernah</malay> it's the orange colour [one]
but <malay>sekarang susah nak cari</malay> I think they stopped production already [ah] I haven't I haven't seen it
for for a while already [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] (uh)
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job [ah] dude
<malay>takde takde</malay> <malay>takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit</malay>
<malay>takde duit takde</malay> table tennis
I think no more already confirm <malay>dorang dah buang punya</malay> like the thing so #lup sup# you know
haven't [ah] but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know [ah] I just scared
<malay>macam</malay> repeat
like history repeat repeat itself [ah]
(uh) ya that's why
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> not that bad because like
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much [ah]
so maybe not that bad [ah]
but then [eh] you got #lobang# for <malay>kerja</malay> or not
ya but like
I don't know [ah] like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all <malay>semua yang tak</malay> halal
in the one that pays well [ah]
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet [ah]
okay [ah] honestly [ah]
<malay>aku tak pernah kerja</malay> banquet
that time you work [what] no [meh]
<malay>yang sebelah yang sebelah</malay> Hard Rock Cafe
[ah]
(uh)
[oh]
#sheikh# also work kitchen [ah]
[oh]
the one a
[eh] but that [one] also see your manager also [ah]
because
ya cause (uh) my friend from <malay>dulu kerja</malay>
it's not really banquet [ah] but they set up for the banquet people [ah]
<malay>kat</malay>
#shang# Shangri-La
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
(uh) like the table chair stage <malay>semua dorang</malay> set up
then usually it's for like reception <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just <malay>tunggu</malay> for the event to finish then they teardown
I think so like who
[oh] yeah yeah yeah but
but <malay>dorang punya</malay> is more for <malay>ini</malay> [kan] is like
like <malay>apa ni</malay> concerts <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
[ah] ya then this [one] is only for
like wedding reception only [ah]
<malay>kat</malay> Shangri-La that that type
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager [ah] so
the manager is like #sheikh# and that [one] also
(uh) like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay [lah]
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much [ah]
he just delegate the work <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>duduk goyang kaki goyang</malay> [ah]
ya
ya
then I don't know [ah] I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends [eh]
<malay>kerja senang</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah buat banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
[oh] ya but Marche <malay>tak</malay> halal [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan gini</malay> [ah]
(uh)
maybe
[eh] have you have you went to Fika before
ya [eh] the food there
ya it's it's
you know where working title is [eh] actually working title closed already it's beside working title [ah]
!huh! they work there
I cannot imagine #rian# at Fika though cause the people there are like really
<malay>berbual</malay> really like proper english <malay>punya</malay> you know and like
how to say [ah] I don't know [ah] I can't imagine #rian# there
like #aidil# #aidil# I still can see him [ah] working at Fika but #rian# a bit hard [ah] to imagine him working there
[eh] but the food there the food
the [eh] the ambiance all
top notch [ah]
like work there also I think #swee#
[eh] the food
a bit more to the <malay>mahal</malay> side [ah]
[oh] I I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause (uh) my friend tell me their service there is like top notch [ah]
but then my friend say [ah] like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
then <malay>dia dapat banyak apa ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>banyak</malay> freebies <malay>semua</malay>
but then <malay>dia kira balik</malay> [kan] actually what he paid for
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get [ah]
worth it [lah] ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend [ah]
[oh]
but I heard the cakes there good [ah] the the <malay>kuih lapis</malay> cake [ah]

apex apex game <malay>dia macam mana</malay>
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> graphics <malay>semua macam</malay> cartoon-ish [kan]
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress [ah]
valorant is not [sia] actually it's quite realistic [what] is like same as almost go but
only the suit like a bit
[oh] (uh) <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> halo kind of graphic [ah]
[eh] how
are you are you buying the five or not
busy <malay>dengan sekolah</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang</malay> five <malay>berapa</malay>
is now is <malay>mahal</malay> cause <malay>orang</malay> resell [eh]
[oh]
I don't know [ah] like <malay>semua orang</malay> like <malay>rebut nak beli</malay> P [eh] actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console [lah]
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] <malay>main</malay> [ah]
like when I go to my <malay>apa ni</malay> cousin's house
(uh)
ya like the first console I owned was
(ugh) cause okay
<malay>aku dari dulu</malay> [kan] like
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
my parents <malay>macam</malay>
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing [ah]
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
but computer <malay>pun</malay> my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
ya so
<malay>dorang</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> okay (uh) #haris# (uh)
<malay>kau main</malay> twenty minutes
then after that [eh] you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my
[eh] [eh] no primary five exam primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
my father [ah] my father <malay>cakap</malay> like [eh] #haris# (uh) okay [ah]
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy I want game boy
not really strike a deal [lah] like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three [ah] so like I never really believe them [ah]
(uh) wouldn't say well [lah] like
so so [ah] A A B B
like A B B B
like I would say it's okay [ah] above average [ah] slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know [ah] one day I just come home [eh]
suddenly like everyone <malay>kat</malay> (uh) <malay>kat luar</malay> then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
then turns out one was for me [ah] one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted I wanted game boy [what]
so my father <malay>cakap dengan</malay> the salesperson the salespersons <malay>cakap like</malay>
[eh] <malay>cik</malay> if you want to buy game boy
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no [ah] but wasted [ah] cause my parents bought when it first came out
so it's one thousand
[ah]
<malay>dah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah panggil gemuk</malay> [pe]
[ah] ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my the slim [one] come out
the once the slim [one] come out <malay>semua beli</malay> [ah]
ya
but then that the closest to console I got [ah]
ya but actually the games there quite good [sia]
ya
[ah]
I think take over [ah] the market
Vita Vita Vita ya ya ya
downfall [lah] ya
then I
but I
I think
I think it's cause it's different [lah] like you don't really have any console yang <malay>kau boleh</malay> use touch screen <malay>kat bawah tapi</malay> still got the tactile buttons
ya it's like
just want to show off features [ah] <malay>ada</malay> dual screen kind of
[ah] that [one] is a Pokemon brand already [ah]
until now right ya Switch
no but Switch still got <malay>ada ada</malay> animal crossing <malay>ada</malay>
got other games [ah]
but quite popular [what] <malay>aku tengok banyak orang</malay> [sia] <malay>main</malay>
ya don't know [ah]
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked [ah] don't know [ah] this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing [ah]
ya
the (uh) he got post on Twitter [ah] I got see a picture of his (uh) like office like that
I think
publicity [ah] like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that [what]
got a
probably that [one] also not he play [ah] maybe his team play for him [ah]
ya
!hais!
<malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
[oh] okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay> ya
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice [leh]
like I okay this [one] is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular [ah]
until now I I looking to play it again you know but <malay>tak [leh] jumpa</malay> [ah] it's called what is it called [eh] (uh)
adventurer concourse I forget [ah]
it is [ah] it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
(uh) medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself [ah]
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war <malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
total war is what [ah]
is it
[oh] no no no
ya <malay>apa</malay> [eh] got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro <malay>yang</malay>
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from [lah]
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget [ah] (uh)
I !wah! I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side [ah]
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
<malay>korang boleh</malay> like form a squad then do like
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
(err) (uh) quite cool [ah]
I forgot what's the name of the game [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia</malay>
plazma burst
(mm)
isn't that just (uh)
escape room
[oh] [oh] is it is it the one <malay>yang kau kena kena</malay> fix the generators <malay>semua</malay>
and then there's a ghost chasing you
[oh] is it
I'm not sure [ah]
#farid# all [ah]
skipper
#aiman#
#aiman#
[oh] I don't know [ah] I never see [ah] they post on twitter [ah]
I never see before [ah] #ipin# I only see him post <malay>punya</malay> video [ah]
okay [lah] not bad [lah] he was top top in singapore [ah] one point of time
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> [kan]
then your
for that hero will increase
[ah] so like (uh) he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again [ah]
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore [ah]
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands #yishun# ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's (uh) asian server [ah]
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> clamp the ranking <malay>kena main banyak</malay> [ah]
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
ya for other country is by state so like #johor# <malay>macam</malay> #johor# will be
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in #johor# top in #selangor# top in #sabah# that kind of thing
ya that's why
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to <malay>macam</malay> separate <malay>semua orang</malay>
singapore is one state [ah] singapore is a state [what] it's a state country right
(uh)
out outdate outdated information [ah] that [one]
okay I can say also [lah]
!hais!
(mmhmm)
how you know
of course [lah]
(mm)
the malay [eh] actually this [one] I can ask my friend [lah] you know #khai#
[ah] she very interested in like malay culture and all that [lah] so like

so like if you

that [one] quite <malay>ni</malay> [ah] he but that guy <malay>keluar</malay> [kan] #samurai# sword [ah]
to <malay>potong</malay> someone

so #fathul# I have a question for you (mm) if you have three wishes what are (err) what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would (err) void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say (um) by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things (hmm) maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants [lah]
and lastly (err) the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world <malay>sebab bila</malay> you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good [ah] when you can do things <malay>yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat</malay>
(mm) and some skills that I want to have (err) maybe include (err) having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world [ah]
(mm) <malay>pasal ilmu ni</malay> but <malay>dia ada banyak</malay> (err) <malay>rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi</malay> (hmm) <malay>kalau dapat ni</malay> best [ah] <malay>pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat</malay> (mm) and <malay>bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni</malay> (mm)
so <malay>ini adalah yang tiga</malay> wishes <malay>yang saya nak</malay> (mm) so <malay>kita</malay> (err) what about you #fathul#
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily (err) to us to some people to live happily is to have (err) the money and the wealth
<malay>pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh</malay> spend on whatever and what not and <malay>bila awak dapat</malay> spend whatever and what not then means (err) with every spending <malay>awak akan rasa</malay> this happiness
(err) so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy [ah] and intelligence also [ah] this is to me I think it relates to me also [ah] because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
(uh) so maybe for now we move (uh) to the next question which is (err) superpowers #fathul# what (err) if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
[ah] [eh]
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of [ah] the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you (err) by accident
<malay>kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang</malay> teleport <malay>ke tempat lain</malay> so <malay>dia jadi</malay> the source of this (err) <malay>kuman</malay> [lah] so <malay>dia yang</malay> spread to others
<malay>dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus</malay> (mm) so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
the the
the amount of (err) infection or the possibilities of (uh) infection rate [ah] you have anything to argue
yes correct
okay <malay>mungkin awak dah cakap ini</malay> okay maybe <malay>saya</malay> agree <malay>sikit</malay>
maybe <malay>awak ada</malay> point over there
<malay>tapi yang</malay> contact tracing <malay>tu mungkin tak tak senangkan</malay> [lah]
<malay>pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia</malay> teleport <malay>kalau dia sendiri dah suka</malay> teleport
(mm) <malay>tapi ini</malay> interesting point of view (mm) so <malay>kalau awak tanya saya apa</malay> superpower <malay>yang saya nak saya nak</malay> power of regeneration
so <malay>contohnya</malay> (err) <malay>jari saya terpotong</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti dia akan</malay> heal <malay>sendiri</malay>
<malay>saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki</malay> dislocate [ah] dia regenerate <malay>sendiri</malay>
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk (uh) ambitions that I have
or maybe (uh) I I can take risks without having worrying that I might (uh) injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe (err) get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win [ah]
provided I am strong [ah] and maybe with this regeneration
(hmm)
I can donate let's say some parts of my (uh) limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
(hmm) where I have this ability so I can do is (err) I request my leg to be cut off and then give away (err) in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard (uh) tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
(mm) what do you think about this regeneration ability
(mm) it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
<malay>dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang</malay> high risk
<malay>itu meminta kematian</malay> [lah]
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having (uh) to be looked at or without (err) being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
(hmm) I have this
think of living in isolation (uh) maybe one maybe <malay>satu hari bila dah dah</malay> experienced everything <malay>yang kita nak</malay> [ah]
I want to be (uh) isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self [ah] to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems (uh) affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
(mm)
how long maybe until I feel peace [ah] so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months [ah] but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months [ah] then slowly maybe I will
(err) increase the number of the period [ah] slowly
okay <malay>mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya</malay> and <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena</malay>
<malay>bergaul dengan orang untuk untuk memahami keadaan orang</malay>
<malay>sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang</malay> we will never know what they face
(hmm)
we can never do something to improve the people around us
so for example <malay>bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong</malay> so <malay>kita akan mencari</malay> solution <malay>untuk menolong seseorang itu</malay>
so <malay>mungkin apa awak cakap</malay> (err) <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] and <malay>tapi bila awak</malay> (err) <malay>saya</malay>
(hmm) <malay>hairan</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa awak</malay> (err) question <malay>bila seseorang itu nak</malay> isolate maybe for months
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable [lah]
but it has to be looked in a certain way [ah] whereby the person
(err)
he is not affecting badly (uh) around the people (uh) (uh) he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state [ah]
(uh)
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
his child behind then <malay>anak-anak dia akan merana</malay> [ah] and
<malay>kalau</malay> months okay months maybe <malay>saya rasa maksimum</malay> (err) maybe not more than nine months [ah]
lesser than that <malay>mungkin</malay> okay
<malay>kenapa</malay> nine months <malay>sebab</malay> within this nine months (um) <malay>budak tu dia akan</malay> grow and after this nine months
they will change a lot [lah] so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small (err) goals small (err)
small achievement so this child will live without (uh) having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife [ah] he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife (err) agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free [ah] to do anything that he wants
do you think so
[eh]
okay <malay>soalan tu</malay> interesting <malay>sepuluh tahun</malay> means <malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay>
<malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay> okay <malay>saya</malay> definitely <malay>akan suruh diri saya</malay> (err) <malay>ini</malay> [ah] invest [ah] invest in bitcoin
(uh) cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
(err)
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary [ah] but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams [ah]
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart [ah]
(mm) so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self (err) I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self [ah]
<malay>sebab</malay> at <malay>umur</malay> ten years old <malay>memang awak cakap betul</malay> (uh) <malay>nak nak faham tentang</malay> certain <malay>barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat</malay> convince [ah]
satu orang ni</malay> at ten years old <malay>dia akan ingat</malay>
and maybe along the way <malay>mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas</malay> and then <malay>dia akan</malay> start
(err) thinking back (err) <malay>apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya</malay> ten years <malay>bila saya ten-year-old</malay> <malay>akan</malay> <malay>betul</malay>
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
(mm) and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
(um) what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos (uh) I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and (uh) an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud [lah] or maybe just email yourself [ah] so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
(err) a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself (uh) since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is (err) I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see (err) how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe (err) start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
so <malay>mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan</malay> (err) (um) <malay>akan</malay> interest <malay>awak</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> maybe one day <malay>juga awak akan jadi</malay> famous because of this [ah]
(mm)
K
you maybe you next we should talk about (um) near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
(err) some luck you managed to stay alive [ah] so for you (err) <malay>apa yang</malay> experience <malay>awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian</malay>
I need to add on <malay>apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati</malay>
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was (err) I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
it happens whereby we have to train where (err) train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> capsize <malay>habis tu bila</malay> capsize <malay>ini kita kena</malay> grab <malay>kawan kita punya kayak</malay>
and get back up [ah] so <malay>bila saya tengah</malay> practice capsize <malay>ini</malay>
instructor <malay>jauh</malay> so <malay>kita jauh daripada semua orang</malay>
<malay>habis tu kita bila saya tengah</malay> capsize <malay>kawan saya dia</malay> lose control of <malay>dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah</malay> capsize <malay>terus saya</malay> tap <malay>saya punya kayak</malay>
<malay>bila saya tengok terbalik ini</malay> so <malay>kawan saya punya bot tak ada</malay>
<malay>saya dekat situ saya</malay> stuck [ah] <malay>saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada</malay> skirt skirt <malay>ini akan</malay> prevent water from entering our kayak
<malay>nak keluarkan</malay> skirt <malay>tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay>
tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> (uh) in hope that <malay>kawan saya dengar saya</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal saya tengah dekat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap tap tap <malay>dia tak dengar</malay> alright <malay>bila dia dengar ini dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas</malay> incident <malay>dia cuba</malay> paddle <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tolak dia</malay> so <malay>dia nak</malay> paddle <malay>susah sikit</malay>
so <malay>saya dekat bawah air</malay> maybe for one minute [ah]
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was (uh) stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall (uh) is when I was
(err) riding bike (uh) it happens maybe due to
(err) rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to (uh) overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next (uh) topic that I have in mind which is (err) a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
(uh) ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
(hmm) whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that (err) there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
but I was skateboarding and <malay>dalam mimpi tu saya rasa</malay> best <malay>nak bila</malay> skateboard <malay>ni rasa seronok</malay> [jer] and
<malay>bila</malay> skateboard <malay>tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun</malay> [oh] [eh] <malay>rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak</malay> skateboard [ah] [ah] <malay>dari situlah saya start</malay>
start skateboard <malay>tapi nak belajar</malay> skateboard <malay>ni dia susah sangat</malay> (err) it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
(um) synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example (uh) few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
(err) I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future (um) a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go (uh) deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took (uh) I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
and <malay>bila dapat tahan</malay> breath <malay>saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar</malay> (uh) free dive and that time <malay>bila kat</malay> swimming pool (uh) <malay>saya ada</malay> swimming <malay>dekat</malay> nine metre pool [ah] [ah] <malay>itu saya cuba</malay>
and <malay>dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat sampai ke</malay> bottom <malay>tapi I was having difficulty breathing [ah] and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that I have
so you have anything to add on

oka
(uh) getting ready to cla

although
not much that you can do in that #bugis# area
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> #fullerton# or #marina# bay sands at least you <malay>boleh turun</malay> and do some shopping
and not to forget
#sim lim# square
the
the mall that replaced #funan#
so lousy now
how can you turn an mall into a sports [ah] (ugh) I have no words for this
velocity

no [lah] the view up there is nice [lah] if only you can bring a drone but sadly you cannot cause parliament <malay>betul-betul dekat sebelah</malay>
parliament no [lah] not not that nice I think clarke quay is still nice <malay>pasal</malay> singapore river
and maybe #istana# <malay>lawa</malay>
ya you're not you're not supposed to fly like five or ten kilometers away from either these two places
maybe it's public safety and also like I think government property privacy [ah]
but which which hotel is it that's the problem you don't remember right
was it or only on mothership
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err)
<malay>surat khabar tak ada</malay>
as in like
facebook article
yes [a'ah]
I see
I think mothership is endorsed by government
I think so
(hmm)
(hmm) I believe so
do you know what's the
difference between SGAG and mothership
no idea
mothership creates good content
mic mic keep drop no but just
no but
they just make more good content
mic drop
no [lah] just cause they came up with the singaporean dream game
[meh]
(um) I don't think so I don't know [lah] see [lah] if not because nowadays I think we are more interested to play checkers

well <malay>wak wak</malay> is I mean he's a champion at checkers then also is my mum and my uncle

[oh] yes
so basically
what it is is
you
instead of putting it in
all the boxes it at your side [eh]
<malay>apa dia buat</malay> is
you need to put the pieces
alternatively like if you are putting it at on all the black boxes put it on all the black boxes only don't need to work on the white
(mm)
yes [eh] but you can use either one [ah] either the black or the white [ah] but you cannot put on both colours
no if I put it on the black boxes you put it on the black boxes also
(mm)
and in chess you can move I think quite a few directions but for checkers or <malay>dam</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> move diagonally
but you can't move back you can only move forward
[eh] chess
[ah] chess
!alamak!
chess I'm not too sure

chess you can move like
front I think

<malay>kita nak</malay> work on <malay>lagu</malay> #farhan# ya
but ya I mean (err)
<malay>aku</malay> kind of <malay>tengah</malay>
(uh) basically
<malay>tak ada tak ada</malay> majority things <malay>yang</malay> come to <malay>aku punya</malay> (err) <malay>aku punya</malay> life
(err)
I've now <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>main</malay> bicycle (err) <malay>aku baru beli</malay> bicycle (err) a cruiser
(err) <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>pergi</malay> cruising around <malay>dengan</malay> family <malay>aku</malay>
(err) other than that <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> working on some project <malay>macam</malay>
songs and what not and then
<malay>aku</malay> been doing a lot of (err) things <malay>kat</malay>
(err) studio
(um)
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
(err) nothing fantastic <malay>yang aku rasa tengah</malay> going on
which is (err) [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>aku rasa tenang</malay> [ah] <malay>macam biasa</malay> [ah]
<malay>tenang</malay> [ah] so more more of and more more upcoming projects
<malay>yang akan kami</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay>
(err)
but <malay>paling</malay> boring is (err) <malay>tak dapat pergi</malay> (err) <malay>seberang tambak</malay> [ah]
<malay>itu yang paling</malay> boring [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> for the past six months <malay>ini</malay>
ya
<malay>sebab</malay> member member <malay>yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga</malay>
so ya
<malay>bila kau nak ikut</malay>
!huh!
[ah]
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> suppose I think (err) I think (err) <malay>dia bukan</malay>
[ah] maybe maybe <malay>betul pada kau macam</malay> in thing <malay>sebab semua orang</malay>
but the point is <malay>sebab tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> activity <malay>yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi</malay>
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is <malay>juga</malay>
it's the best time <malay>untuk nak</malay> explore and then <malay>kita</malay> are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration <malay>yang</malay>
it will stop <malay>orang kata macam</malay>
<malay>kalau dulu lepas sekolah</malay>
I mean time <malay>sekolah kita</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu</malay> explore <malay>kat bawah</malay> block <malay>lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh</malay>
<malay>lepas itu mungkin ada orang</malay>
(err) <malay>main</malay>
<malay>main tangkap</malay> spider at some point of time [kan] <malay>kita orang dah malas buat benda ni</malay> because kita nak kerja</malay>
so when <malay>kita dah kerja</malay> probably <malay>kita jumpa</malay> somebody
(err) <malay>bila</malay> (mm) <malay>jumpa kawan</malay>
[ah] nonsense <malay>buat</malay> nonsense nonsense <malay>punya barang</malay> then
<malay>aku rasa</malay> at this point of time <malay>pasal kita orang kena</malay>
<malay>tersekat dekat negeri</malay>
<malay>jadi mungkin aku rasa</malay> that's the best time <malay>untuk</malay> (um) <malay>beriadah</malay> [ah]
<malay>untuk</malay> just do leisure out of
<malay>kau punya</malay> own comfort zone <malay>jadi</malay> this is the best time <malay>untuk kau</malay> come back to <malay>kau punya</malay>
(err) youth <malay>balik ke</malay>
you know where <malay>kau kau</malay> missing out
[ah] and <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's a good good good thing <malay>juga</malay> with this (um)
with this (err) pandemic because
<malay>aku rasa kita</malay> will tend to <malay>macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita</malay> itself
<malay>ada</malay> this <malay>tempat ada</malay> that <malay>tempat ada</malay>
then <malay>kita pun tahu yang macam</malay> okay <malay>kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> right now apart from just <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> start to do cycling will start to explore <malay>macam</malay>
(um) <malay>tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi</malay> before
[ah] so <malay>aku rasa</malay>
it's good <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
but (err) <malay>kalau kau cakap</malay> about that is the the the in thing right now
probably ya probably

<malay>macam</malay> that kind [ah] <malay>lepas tu sekali macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh]
open [ah] <malay>lepas tu macam</malay> [eh]
boy [ah] open [ah] <malay>itu macam</malay> that kind of thing [ah]
nonsense [kan]
but this was before <malay>yang</malay> the first phase was the one <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> chance <malay>untuk keluar pun</malay> [kan]
[kan] that first few weeks [kan] at least a month <malay>tak keluar</malay> [kan]
so this phase two <malay>yang</malay> that one month <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kedai-kedai gunting pun</malay>
ya [kan]
ya circuit breaker
like I think we were talking about circuit breaker itself
phase one was later on
yes and then <malay>ada</malay> phase two right
ya so this was <malay>macam</malay> the first
first few days <malay>yang</malay> when <malay>dia orang</malay> announce <malay>tak boleh keluar</malay>
[ah]
okay [ah] (err)
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> was having so much (err) <malay>banyak banyak</malay> (um)
kind of <malay>macam</malay> (err) slowly slowly became <malay>macam</malay>
spending [sia]
<malay>dalam diam aku</malay> did a lot of shopping you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> online shopping which is <malay>aku</malay> never that did did that before [ah] but I really did [ah]
and then ya it was really <malay>macam</malay>
like any other day any other day it was just <malay>macam</malay> two dollar <malay>punya</malay> shopee
three dollar <malay>punya</malay> stuff and then every
like every two three days <malay>mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku</malay> [eh]
but ya [lah] it was really funny that <malay>aku</malay> (err) <malay>ada</malay> that phase [ah]
because <malay>aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> [eh]
(mm) I mean being <malay>apa yang engkau nak buat</malay>
and then <malay>kita orang tak ada</malay> that that that that
<malay>tanah lapang</malay> you know we don't have a big (um)
big land to
to play around to to run around
[ah]
<malay>kalau kau nak pergi luar</malay> to check people out <malay>pun macam</malay>
and the road was empty the whole street was lonely
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> that that experience was really <malay>macam</malay> best <malay>untuk aku</malay> [ah]
and then because <malay>aku pun ada</malay> at some point of time
(err) during that circuit time <malay>pun aku hantar</malay>
<malay>aku punya aku punya</malay> senior <malay>aku punya</malay> dad <malay>dekat hospital jadi</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> saw how the street are lonely
till it go into phase one
and then yes
phase one is when everybody <malay>macam</malay> really <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sudah</malay> come back to <malay>macam</malay> you know
(um) lively [ah]
[ah]
I think <malay>yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka</malay>
[ah]
but ya
but I think during (err)
during (err) <malay>apa</malay> (err)
during (err) circuit breaker <malay>punya</malay> time <malay>pun</malay> I think (um)
I did walk around [lah] <malay>macam pergi</malay> mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
!wow!
it was really <malay>macam</malay> almost to
almost to <malay>macam</malay>
being in the eighties <malay>balik</malay> where there is not much people around
(err)
but at the same time <malay>pun macam</malay> lonely <malay>juga</malay>
[ah]
ya
ya
I think it's okay if we are younger
because <malay>kita pun</malay> will be hide inside
you know <malay>macam</malay> it's okay if you're younger
but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have (um)
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then (um)
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown [ah] and then ya
<malay>semua benda boleh boleh</malay> change <malay>kalau tak betul-betul you can change you <malay>punya</malay>
perspective you can be
crazy also <malay>juga</malay> [kan]
right I mean
but we we are alright with that we've we've
we've done that with our music life we've we've we used to be isolations
ya
so ya [lah] but still <malay>pun</malay>
the effects are there [lah] you know
[ah] the effect and I just <malay>macam</malay> for the
<malay>tak tahu</malay> how it will go on [lah] but I guess
this is one part of our life <malay>yang kita jumpa</malay> [ah] you know
(err) I don't think
it might happen again or it might happen again but <malay>lagi</malay> more [ah]
[kan]
<malay>kerja</malay> [ah] it's not no work you know affected
<malay>aku rasa</malay> it's (err) more of (err)
more of (err) like going through a war
<malay>tapi</malay> it's not the war of bombing [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
it's <malay>macam</malay> (um)
<malay>macam</malay> (um)
it's <malay>macam</malay>
a smooth war [ah] you know a smooth war that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kita tak boleh</malay> expect that you know
<malay>kita tak boleh</malay> expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada kerja</malay> or probably <malay>macam</malay>

[oh] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] (um)
<malay>aku pun macam kira macam</malay> !wow! after all these years (err)
of going through [eh] (err) things (um)
I I was having a conversation the other day <malay>balik pada macam</malay>
[ah] the things that we do
[ah] you know <malay>macam</malay> (err) you know talking about
music in general <malay>macam macam</malay> (err) the whole world right now is (err) having
or the whole creative <malay>punya</malay> line in the whole wide world is (um)
is (err) not doing very well right
<malay>habis aku</malay> was just (err) <malay>bagi tahu</malay>
(err) #deedee# the other day a friend of <malay>kau tahu</malay> #deedee# [lah] [kan]
so <malay>aku bagi tahu</malay> #deedee# about <malay>macam</malay> you know the rest of the world
(um) especially <malay>macam dekat</malay> and what not
they had an industry and the thing is
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> creative was kind of <malay>macam</malay> stopped right now
and kind of stopped or or or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
<malay>kita orang</malay> was that <malay>macam kita orang tak ada</malay> industry and <malay>kita orang nak kena</malay> stop <malay>juga</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> you get what I mean it's like <malay>macam</malay> (um)
<malay>macam</malay> ya [lah]
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
but <malay>kita orang</malay> kind of <malay>tak ada</malay> industry
<malay>pun nak kena</malay> stop <malay>juga sama macam dia orang</malay>
and <malay>lagi teruk</malay>
(ugh)
ya ya ya all the big (err) bars club
ya I mean but what lucky enough <malay>juga</malay> what if <malay>kalau kau dah baru</malay> graduate
<malay>kau baru</malay> graduate last year probably <malay>baru nak</malay> start <malay>kerja dah</malay>
you know but now lucky enough <malay>macam kau ada</malay> time <malay>untuk</malay> breather you know a bit breather and
(um)
chill a little bit and them (um)
you can have time <malay>untuk</malay>
see what's going on and then from there
(err)
come to a point whether
<malay>apa kau nak buat</malay> ready <malay>untuk</malay> next you know
because right now also everything <malay>macam kau</malay> was talking about
(uh) all this <malay>macam kerja dekat dalam studio</malay>
and what not
and you know right now everyone was really <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) really <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tak tak boleh</malay> go out for
for in the studio <malay>pun kalau tak betul-betul</malay>
and even now the studio are all not operating <malay>pun</malay>
ya it's like the same thing like what happened <malay>dekat ini juga</malay>
time (um) everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
crazy times <malay>juga</malay>
(uh) for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not (um)
youtube just used whatever content you know <malay>macam</malay>
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if if you look like really really close
(um)
ya <malay>semua orang macam</malay>
anyhow [ah] <malay>kira macam sembarang</malay> [ah] <malay>kira</malay> (uh) it's ya
it was haywire napster coming in you know
[ah] it was for for for consumer they will like it [ah]
but people who produce it people who
who you know
and even <malay>macam sekarang ini macam</malay> netflix and there are big big (err)
(mm) you know big (err) movie affected by
but how they going to use all these <malay>macam</malay> despite of time
you know <malay>macam</malay> how can they <malay>macam selit</malay> how can they like you know (err)
whack or or or
or just like (um) be part of
this you know like just come in and slide in
ya I mean
there will be light there will be light
<malay>aku</malay> I'm very sure there will be there will be light somewhere
it's just that <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
<malay>aku rasa</malay> don't don't don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you <malay>tak macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada benda yang yang kau belajar</malay>
but the thing is take it as if <malay>macam</malay> there's a new skill <malay>yang kau belajar</malay>
apart from that probably (um)
like also <malay>kau kena ingat juga</malay> since <malay>kau cakap</malay> video <malay>dah ada</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> you should share it [ah] you know <malay>macam</malay>
share it because ya

ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
[ah] ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
because like ya <malay>macam</malay>
okay [ah] I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use [ah]
like you can't really copyright that shit
[eh] fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
(err) ya I think that's different
(mm) fair
<malay>asal pula</malay>
(oo) ya okay I get it I get it
is it not bad [sia]
I mean I mean at that price range quite affordable already [sia] considering like
okay [lah] okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
[ah] (uh huh)
is is like <malay>apa</malay>
(err) it's like five in india
somebody <malay>dekat dalam kat</malay> india
somebody copy [eh] copyrighted [ah] ya copyrighted [ah]
somebody copyrighted five so
five they Sony can't release five as five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
I mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony Sony will try to
probably [ah] I think
probably will try to buy it off the person [ah]
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
I mean iphone <malay>punya itu</malay> okay [lah] no I mean iphone bad examples because they already copyrighted all the
all the way the series so like in that same vein you can actually do that ya like if you wanted money [ah] you know unless <malay>dia orang macam</malay> like [ah] okay [ah] <malay>kita</malay> skip one generation that kind of thing so it will be very weird it will be like
one two three four
then five is <malay>apa</malay> roman numerical V
<malay>bodoh</malay>
[ah] ya and it's Sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
[oh] four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya [lah] you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create [ah] create [ah] you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay [ah] it was rocky [ah]
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better [ah]
I mean it's just a brand name only [ah] at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like (oo) look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive [ah] but then it's like
<malay>bodoh</malay>
[eh] [ah] no I'm not about that life man
man
no [ah] not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya [lah] I mean it is a gaming peripheral [ah] but still like
at least limit it [ah] like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like [oh] Razer
and then it you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that [one] by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
[eh] that kind
[ah]
I mean I have <malay>tukar topik</malay> [ah] like I have troubles
with my current night shift
cannot [sia] boring <malay>gila</malay> [siol]
boring <malay>gila</malay>
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this [one] is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like [oh] my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay [lah] like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the [one] that you are looking at this the second [one]
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit [lah] like
whoever [ah] whoever say something right then (err) or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job [ah] and then like cannot [ah]
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring [siol]
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya [lah] no [lah] leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
(uh) I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can [ah] but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay [ah] depends on the company [lah] but this is this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense [ah] but
the travel expense though it's free
no that's the thing the other thing is I have to clarify was <malay>apa</malay> this transport allowance right
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right [ah] I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance [ah] you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything [ah]
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can [ah]
let anyone use the thing
[sial] [ah] I have I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me [ah]
no [lah] it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like [eh] there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like (err) if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
(uh) all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras [ah]
like I'm just saying there's
there's (uh)
hidden thing to it [lah] like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
<malay>gaji</malay> then like for what [sia]
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply [ah]
no [ah]
like where the hell am I supposed to go [sia] if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can [ah] can is can [ah] like the
like the the the culture quite laid back quite <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] considering like anytime you can just ask somebody to cover for you because they all like okay
you work in shifts then after you work morning then <malay>cukup</malay> time <malay>dah lapar</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau nak apa apa tak kat kedai</malay> #kopi#
<malay>aku nak gi</malay>
then take orders [ah] #teh# #teh# #kopi# <malay>ni itu</malay>
then if <malay>tak</malay> then order from Grab
I mean the
no [ah]
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the no you eat there in the !oops! room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
(uh) I mean it's true [ah] I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that [one] then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before [lah] but
the during the <malay>kerja</malay> but sometimes
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this [ah] job
because <malay>dia punya tempat kat</malay> town
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like [sial] [ah] where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
okay [ah] don't say town [lah] #ulu# <malay>punya tempat pun susah nak cari</malay> three fifty like
(uh) ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is [ah] but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days a few days ago also
[ah] zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
a <malay>saman</malay> so to speak
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya [lah]
[eh] no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
is
fourteen days [siol] I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
it's it's set for their citizen [ah] I think <malay>kena saman</malay>
okay [ah] not really okay [ah]
the <malay>saman saman</malay> is a is a wrong choice of word [ah] (err) it's more of (err) ya
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that [lah] like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
but it's not a <malay>saman</malay>
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what (uh)
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
(uh) I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay [ah]
[eh] but then new zealand that time got (uh) recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive [ah]
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see [lah] what happened now
three hundred thousand already
(uh huh)
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see [eh] go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
[ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like [sial] [ah]
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit [sia] like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
(oo)
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest [what] so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya [lah] I mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only [ah] I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything [ah]
ya
okay
really
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
ya #borat# is #borat# [lah] so
I wonder if they edited that out
(uh huh)
I mean to be okay [ah] no [ah]
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is [ah] but you know it's fucking video proof [ah] like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
(uh) they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know [lah] which state [ah] one of the judge [lah] they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is [ah]
[ah]
no comments no comments
in
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for #taiwan# soon
I think world war three should start soon
(err) china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to #taiwan# right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit #taiwan# [ah]
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
[eh] ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
#taiwan# is part of china and then
I mean ya [lah] like
and they could have just let #taiwan#
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of #taiwan# like no
I think they call them (uh) D D C P right [eh] no D C C
[oh] !wow!
I mean #taiwan# is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay I mean
okay let's be let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay [lah]
that [one] no comments [ah] ya
it has it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
legit [ah]
[oh] !wow!
<malay>bodoh</malay>
(uh huh)
!ee! [ah] ya
that's malaysia
that's the issue I mean
ya
you all busy fighting each other also [lah]
[kan]
ya [sia] all those all those [ah] grab drivers top up from <malay>semua</malay> they like bloody salty [lah] [sia]
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
all this <malay>ni semua nak tak nak</malay> [jer]
<malay>abeh dah malas nak buat apa</malay>
[oh] speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay [ah] it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
[kan] I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
[ah]
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
[oh] obama <malay>punya tu</malay> toast invited obama to play among us
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that [lah] but okay [ah] there are the backwater parts [ah]
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
one of the <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
[sial] [ah]
(uh huh)
it's basic human nature [lah] what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you [eh]
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
<malay>banyak kau punya</malay> millions
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya [lah]
okay
(uh huh)
okay
!wow!
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions [ah]
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is it is what it is [ah] it's his style
either way it [eh] no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe [eh]
we might as well be
#kim jong un#
[oh] my god I don't know [ah] [sia]
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
<malay>nak buat</malay> [sia]
and that that is trump in a nutshell [lah] [eh]
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing [oh] I do (uh) money money money lagging
[oh] !wow!
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care [ah]
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the period
that [one] terrible [siol] like
only essential workers [what]
me [ah]
then like yours truly [ah]
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
[ah] rental <malay>punya tu</malay>
they got
it's not even that much [sia]
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like [sial] [ah] they can [sial] [ah] that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during period [sial] [ah] how to earn fifty [sia]
okay [ah] not not everyone can [ah] but that's why that's why during I had the same driver a week straight [sia]
he live somewhere [ah] there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book [eh] same guy tomorrow [eh] same guy
but <malay>padehal</malay> he just like on the app <malay>lepak kat rumah</malay> then <malay>tunggu ada</malay> call [jer] the [eh] bro I on the way [eh]
then like [ah] sorry [ah] bro <malay>ada benda boleh tunggu</malay> ten minutes <malay>tak</malay>
and like okay [ah] ten minutes only [what] not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
picky or like in a rush kind of thing cause you know I I go out early then I don't <malay>sampai kerja</malay> like on time on time I always <malay>sampai kerja</malay> with a lot of time still like half an hour before
that kind of shit [lah] so like I don't really care will have to wait extra just for the Grab to <malay>sampai</malay>
no it's like I'm there I'm just waiting you pick me up go <malay>dah sampai kerja buat kerja</malay> but then it's like ya
like unless on that day I overslept or something
then like shit I need to go now I need to go I need to <malay>sampai</malay> like right now
rare [ah] but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no [ah]
if not <malay>nak kena</malay> <malay>tunggu lama</malay> [siol] or the the best the best that I got (uh) book
the <malay>punya</malay> say ten minutes
it was at #boon lay#
[ah] around that area <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu tak sampai sampai</malay> the car not even moving
don't know call call message
everything no reply
[siol] then I like what the fuck [sial] wait here half an hour already [siol] then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing [sia] cancel
no [ah]
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already [sia]
[kan]
then like <malay>gi mampos</malay> [ah]
just cancel get a new [one]
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
(uh)
okay [lah] ya there's there's the more apt way to say it [lah]
<malay>asal</malay> [kan] <malay>makanan sampai boleh makan dah cukup</malay> that kind of thing
like no see that's the thing there's a lot of patient customers out there like <malay>kalau kau ajak</malay> fight <malay>dah dua jam</malay> then <malay>tu lain cerita</malay> [ah] or the worse [one] is
you collect the food already
you collect the food already <malay>dah sampai</malay> right
then you put delivered
then <malay>takde</malay> the food not there
#sot# [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
okay <malay>makanan dah sampai</malay> the thing says okay delivered <malay>buka pintu</malay>
<malay>mana makanan dia</malay>
then like [eh] [sial] [ah] <malay>kena</malay> scam
[oh] ya ya ya ya
then <malay>terus dia keluar</malay> [kan] pizza <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>tu memang ajak</malay> fight
ya
or those people in I mean the disabled people
(hmm)
[ah]
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift [what]
like rare you find
that that [one] is dorms
[eh] well
service industry [lah] [eh]
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit [ah] you get that kind of shit [ah]
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
okay [ah] <malay>suka hati korang</malay> [ah] [ah] you want to stock up I don't know how many
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
okay [ah] <malay>suka hati</malay> [ah]
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it [ah]
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
cause <malay>malam</malay> is when all the supplies <malay>masuk</malay> [pe]
then ya all the vendors <malay>datang</malay> then they take stock and all that nonsense usually it's like right now currently [ah] is like
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night [ah]
cause
<malay>takde orang</malay>
(mm)
[ah]
okay [lah] I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
[ah] #gek poh# <malay>punya</malay> prime small-ish [ah] so like [ah] there's not
there's only one entrance and one exit [lah] so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
then <malay>takde</malay> cashier
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell [ah] got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell
then the person will come
ha right
<malay>biol</malay>
then provided you got exact change
[ah] <malay>bodoh</malay>
<malay>bodoh tu cari</malay> fight
<malay>baik baik takde</malay> police case <malay>terus jadi</malay> police case
I'm helping do your job
[ha] <malay>bodoh</malay>
but ya I mean that that period [ah]
the the one that people were all in panic
<malay>bodoh</malay> it's fucking <malay>bodoh</malay>
that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you [eh] not the six hundred no
one point five litre
I tell you which driver <malay>tak mengamok</malay> if they get that kind of thing
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
[ah]
like okay [ah] if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand [ah] but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like [eh] !siala!
this thing [ah] like that like that like that
then like
<malay>bodoh</malay> [ah] it's just <malay>bodoh</malay>
free masks don't know how many times already they updrage the mask some more
the first [one] was too tight ya that [one] that [one] was too tight but okay [ah] the rest all fine so okay [ah] <malay>apa-apa</malay> [ah]

(uh huh)
[ah] yes correct correct
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>abeh</malay>
how how does how does it work
in the new (uh) version
okay
(mm) (mm)
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice [ah] there's no (uh) you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can (err)
do according to your preferences [ah]
[ah] okay so there's no like
four four two
(mm)
(mm)
so in order for me to play
for example #tiki-taka# I cannot have a
(uh) anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my (uh) my formation is flick enough for the #tiki-taka# or
in other formation #gegenpress# [ah] so <malay>tak boleh</malay> just <malay>sembarangan</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference [ah] like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what [lah]
so for the
players also
(mm)
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and (uh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[ah] okay okay okay so
they have their own (uh) attitude [lah] and (uh) they have their own attitude when facing the
[ah] each games [ah]
the what what clubs other than the english premier league <malay>tak ada</malay> logo
(mm)
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right denmark is it
[ah]
so so <malay>apa</malay> (uh) what what what club are you planning to manage
if I'm not wrong [eh] (uh) the last
on <malay>aku main</malay> is that time time poly is sixteen
that's that's long [sia]
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year [sia] last year or last two years
so I [eh] correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be [ah] fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing twenty you think twenty one coming soon or not
[oh] the the twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
[ah] ya
[oh] I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out [ah] so if okay if I am going to download it
[ah] before download it your <malay>kau nya</malay> laptop <malay>macam mana</malay> like what is the specifications cause <malay>aku tak nak</malay>
[ah]
okay
which <malay>apa</malay> brand [ah]
Acer (uh) you got you got remember what it's a A what

[ah] K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
NVIDIA (uh) have <malay>semua semua</malay> all have [ah]
okay [lah] so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
laptop <malay>boleh pakai ke tak untuk</malay>
[ah] okay
okay
F sixteen and twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
[ah]
ya I know I know I know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
apparently okay for for for for storage data I have a lot <malay>memang ada banyak</malay> [lah]
I have [ah] eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth [ah]
I don't want jagged jagged (uh) you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
[ah]
[ah]
ya hopefully
but wasted the twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also (uh) got twenty touch
[lah] <malay>ini</malay> what's the difference I don't know touch is just for anything that is not computer but also not mobile phone [pe] I don't know why mobile phone cannot work cannot simulate touch although
[ah]
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
[a'ah]
that's a
that's stressful
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people [ah] cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror [ah] [kan] but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
[ah]
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say #ronaldo# #cristiano ronaldo#

so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
okay
this social group is
very important [lah] actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
(mm)
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games [ah]
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
all these is over then maybe <malay>aku</malay> will check it out [lah]
[ah]
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
<malay>takde</malay> [ah] I don't have I don't have the the the
port for it
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tak baru</malay> it's it's quite latest [one] you know it's two thousand nineteen era
but I don't have the LAN cable cause well is more to you know more to notebook <malay>yang</malay> flat flat those [ah]
those [ah] [ah] okay the the reason why <malay>aku ada</malay> this laptop is <malay>pasal mak aku nak buat</malay> you know photoshop and and whatever nonsense [ah]
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than sixteen
so and that [one] is used to for my <malay>adik punya apa tu</malay> school
which Zoom <malay>pun boleh</malay> lag
no I mean sorry let me be more specific opening Zoom <malay>dah</malay> lag
running the whole thing <malay>nak</malay> type password <malay>dah</malay> you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear [ah] then
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know [lah] I I
[ah]
I I mean I I know about the the the
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother <malay>pakai</malay> you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
(mm)
it is intensive [ah] okay but anyway
okay [ah] maybe after this then I will give it a try [ah]
<malay>nanti</malay> [eh] so
the whole day [ah] <malay>nanti kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kau keluar</malay>
okay [lah] we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
new features with you that I may not be familiar with [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
maybe take a good look about it <malay>tengok-tengok</malay> look
look left look right
look look see see [lah] that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
(mm)
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
(mm)
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the [ah] twenty is very realistic every every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
[ah] so
so imagine actually imagine
twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
[eh] [eh] how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have [sia] god damn it four more days okay [ah] nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine [lah] maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be
real good imagine I mean if you maybe look the singapore league <malay>dia cakap</malay>
prime minister #lee hsien loong# announces circuit breaker S leagues to stop game
there is a singapore league already if I'm not wrong so how
then if I play the malaysian league
my maybe I don't know I don't know whether players like #haris harun# still there but borders are closed how's that how's that gonna help me
well technically
[ah] new season [pe] new season they go home and whatnot then how they gonna come back I lost a lot of star player then I got the argentinian guy or whatever his name is in #johor# [ah] ya <malay>takzim darussalam</malay> [eh] #johor# <malay>takzim</malay>
[ah]
if they all go back and then all borders closed how my my malaysian squad is not all malaysians [pe] is
majority foreigners so just like that I spend millions of ringgit malaysia
for nothing
(mm)
[ah] I mean
[ah]
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay wait
league one semi-pro that's actually very terrible [pe]
cause semi-pro is supposed to be the
north north south ya north south
how did bolton wanderers end up there
I mean how can they fall that bad
I mean
how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
[a'ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
so okay [ah]
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see [ah]
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see [eh] when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing [ah]
(mm)
that is <malay>kalau ada orang</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
<malay>apa</malay> nobody give
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
#serie# A <malay>apa punya</malay> guess
(mm)
I mean you can ask #juventus# how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that [one] is their what italian one is it
[oh] okay
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's so
!wah!
ya correct
(mmhmm)
[ah] yes yes
(mm) (mm)
[ah] okay I mean
well that's
actually quite sad [eh] <malay>kalau kau</malay> if you're from the
(err) when they are from the group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
it be quite you know quite <malay>sedih</malay> [kan] actually to be what to be honest
but [ah] english english wise <malay>takde</malay>
cause there were
(mm) (mm)
<malay>takde tak</malay> I I I've seen the
english <malay>punya</malay> league
there is know the
<malay>cam</malay> the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know
even below north south
<malay>ye</malay> from national then north south
which is on the same path they still have below and below and below <malay>ada</malay> below what the heck I think I think it's
time for them to just you know what
regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you know
singapore <malay>ada</malay>
S league delta league don't know what actually <malay>kita ada</malay> [lah] that is why the government decide to dissolve
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] that's why
ya
ya but
I mean ya [lah] I mean that <malay>macam adik aku</malay> every
day
every night [ah] <malay>dia</malay> [ah] he come back from his camp army camp <malay>nanti around</malay>
maybe six plus <malay>dia makan</malay> by seven he will be out
<malay>dengan</malay> member member <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>kat bawah</malay> block
then <malay>main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik</malay>
so everyday like this but he's not gonna tell us [lah] whether he he play in league <malay>ke</malay> he play in what nonsense [ah] cause
I mean technically if everyday
he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore [ah] <malay>abeh takkan takkan</malay> [seh] [eh]
<malay>nak main bola</malay> like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
(err) physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger [ah]
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger [ah] I'm the privileged [one] as compared to
whatever it is [ah] but there's a lot of african kid who's <malay>buncit</malay> so I can relate
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause
body change
unfortunately and my body change reflexes change
your mind can't keep up with what your body more and at the same time
when you fly when you jump and fly high
increase weight means increase pain
so I'm not gonna risk it
that was after secondary school after first year poly
second year poly I start I stop already
ya
so poly
poly year two
year three
year one year two
year one [eh] <malay>kena</malay> okay anyway [ah]
CISCO CISCO [oh] that's almost seven years
seven years that's <malay>lama</malay> [pe] <malay>aku</malay> poly
bankrupt <malay>aku</malay> wait wait wait
[ah]
<malay>tahun empat tahun pastu</malay> [ah] <malay>enam enam</malay> years [ah] I haven't been playing football actually <malay>lama</malay> [pe]
six seven six seven years I never play
[oh] anyway if you want to know [ah] five aside
no body contact I mean this is the rules and regulation by that [one] no body contact so <malay>kalau nak</malay> tackle
you just [eh] <malay>aku</malay> tackle <malay>kau</malay> okay then <malay>tu bola kau lepaskan</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
I mean that's a good idea [ah]
I mean true
you want to be
[ah]
(mm)
I mean technique ya I mean true you have to let it go
but I'm quite surprised why
he managed to win the ball in that manner in the first place
yes
watch football would be know recently [lah] (uh) after army
ya actually true still two years ago at least after army CISCO after CISCO I <malay>dah dah</malay> don't
I don't catch up already cause know
<malay>takde</malay> time you want to sleep more then work
people watch football at three I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
spartan the hello universe but then if they are just standing down there looking at <malay>itik ayam kambing</malay>
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say [eh]
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true [ah]
to [ah]
well I mean
like what
how many times <malay>kita</malay> [ah] <malay>punya</malay>
[ah] ministers <malay>cakap apa</malay> unprecedented crisis
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
(mm)
[ah] ya <malay>aku tahu aku tahu</malay>
but you <malay>minum</malay> how many times you cannot <malay>berbual</malay> tamil [tau]
if you notice
[eh] he cannot speak tamil [pe]
<malay>boleh ke</malay>
then he shouldn't
(mm)
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
nobody dubbed over him [kan]
dub <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] [ah] I mean <malay>kalau kau</malay> I mean if you just say vote for me for example vote for me I also can [ah]
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say #vanakam# for thirty times [ah] for for thirty minutes [pe] I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
in in in that language do you listen in <malay>melayu</malay> or do you listen in
english
of course [ah]
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see [ah] my my
[ah] what's that called [ah] my <malay>nenek</malay> my
grandfather my
basically all the old people [ah]
all the our not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me [lah] so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
once you grow old he say <malay>bila</malay> once <malay>dah tua</malay>
[ah] the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
(mmhmm)
okay
[a'ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
okay
ya correct
(mm)
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this (uh)
not say rider [ah] this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
with walking stick like <malay>dia datang</malay>
and then and he and she asked me in english about I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from #johor# to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who (um) who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
and of all the language she choose <malay>abeh</malay> luckily she didn't choose
mandarin or tamil [lah] if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent [ah] and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right !wah! this is very confusing [ah]
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true [pe]
malaysian old lady and a old lady in malaysia <malay>apa</malay>
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish [ah] no [sia]
you know you cannot say even you're not even supposed to [eh] <malay>nenek</malay> you want go where no no you say [oh] where you heading ma'am
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
it's like <malay>dok cik</malay> you know it sound so weird know
but
and <malay>dia punya</malay> english is really tiptop [ah] so I I I suspect
I suspect
!aiya! I mean in the first place maybe <malay>ada</malay> the word <malay>datuk kat depan dia punya dia punya</malay>
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
(mm)
so how
[a'ah]
(mm)
okay
then <malay>mati</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh berbual</malay> [ah]
you you agree [pe] okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say [lah] how
[ah]
ya that's why
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
but [ah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] true
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
when old people ask us [eh] <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] <malay>dah ni dah tu</malay> you answer also they are not gonna listen [pe] they just gonna keep asking whatever we talk they just talk [pe] unless you want to
remind each other about know how your going and calling each other brother in italian [pe]
okay but you you understand what I trying to say [pe]
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
(mm)
ya
I mean [ah] there there is a I think there's a occasion [pe] there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
wait wait and he and he said multiple times <malay>dia tak nak</malay> interrupt us he don't want to he [pe] he just over here he don't want interrupt us
yet he's always interrupting us [oh] by the way [ah]
<malay>aku nampak dia minum tu kat bawah sini pasal</malay> you know why or not you know why or not
<malay>dia tinggal tingkat lapan</malay> that time that time <malay>aku</malay> that time <malay>aku nampak dia keluar nasib aku pakai</malay> mask <malay>dengan topi</malay> [sia] you know
(mm)
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
then he look at me he and he ask me <malay>nak pergi tingkat mana</malay> hello I mean I'm not trying to be rude or anything
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
<malay>dorang nak pergi tingkat satu</malay>
there's a very high chance I'm not judging I'm not judgemental <malay>ke apa benda</malay>
(err) right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
(mm)
[ah]
okay okay
[ah] coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
I mean technically #asu# [pe] #asu# <malay>terperanjat</malay> [lah] that you
you came in a very quiet manner cause there's is <malay>kau datang</malay> awkward [sia]
<malay>bila</malay>
time <malay>ke</malay>
that [one] for what [eh]
time <malay>aku</malay> <malay>asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kau datang</malay>
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] that is quite long [tau]
ya actually a lot of things changed [ah]
but it's nice
[ah] ya [lah]
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot [lah] I mean it's so so constricted [lah] this place to be honest
<malay>macam</malay> if you're just being stuck here I mean you know how it feels [pe] to be stuck at home
(uh) twenty twenty four seven
like there's no purpose at least <malay>kalau kau</malay> you know <malay>kau gi kerja</malay> there is a purpose I in life
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a [ah] there is a schedule
[ah]
[ah] now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean
now is already twenty september [pe] you you there's what is it called your your
work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already [tau]
how unproductive are you going to get
how more
more unproductive are you going to get
you don't feel embarrassed
technically
I know
(mmhmm)
there is a
ya
yes
I mean I tried to warn you
I mean ya I know I understand how you feel to to to to be squeezed
<malay>apa</malay>
just for maintenance [ah]
(mm)
ya I know I know
I mean
!wow! that sucks
(mm)
ya ya
I mean just like that [eh]
(err)
a a billion dollar company multi billion dollar company just
gone [sia]
but
I mean oil should be cheaper right or
it already
keep it up
picking up already
[ah]
(mm)
I mean ya [lah] ya [lah] there
do you think do you think <malay>dorang</malay> will
will go back
to
quote unquote our prime minister status
for unpaid
I mean
I mean I'm not saying anything [lah] but in order for you to you know
move forward in this pandemic is to ensure the china tension doesn't rise any higher cause
as long as and china is continue to be fighting I don't think there will be a vaccine anytime soon
[ah]
[ah] ya
okay
[ah]
now that's a very interesting concept
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
I
I don't want to die
the what's that called I mean I don't know what the are trying to think [ah] but
but (uh) I mean if we see (uh)
technically if the government is not very
is saying is saying that the mask does not work
I think we can raise it up to our [ah] and
[ah]
so maybe we can raise up to our and ask our government to release us from this
mask thing I mean
we got safe entry [pe]
the the thing is does it work though

hi #husna#
(mm)
okay so (um) our marriage (uh) now is five years already yes okay so you're talking about (uh) the starting point or just current
(mm)
(mm) okay
(mm)
what okay
planning
okay
[oh]
okay
now it's D already disaster damage
devolution done (uh) last one is done [lah]
okay if let's say right for me [ah] if I plan [eh] sometimes it doesn't work
that way so it's very disappointing [ah] better don't plan just go you say like you will say (uh) if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
the other side will be like (uh) [oh] no I want this one [ah] [eh] you cannot I plan already [mah] so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think [eh] want to get married it's not going to be (uh) sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later [lah] <malay>nanti dulu berbual</malay> so <malay>sekarang kita</malay> go <malay>dulu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> later part then we can plan <malay>lepas tu buat</malay> plan K (uh) getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house [mah]
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle [lah]
[ah] that is for me
so in between like what's happening you have to be have own trust [lah] each other have their own trust
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like <malay>macam</malay> you know [lah] to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see
then just go (mmhmm)
okay
[ah]
okay I guess correct ya
(hmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he no ya but I think for planning something hasty leave it up to me correct like for example when we went to get the house you shouldn't at decision that for example we want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married [ah] yes correct that that that's on my wife correct
okay
(mmhmm)
decision [lah] ya
[ha] yes correct that that that's on my wife correct
(mm)
plan first [lah] that's
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>yang kat mana</malay> where at where
[oh] ya that was was okay I remember you want me to say about it
that was that one was at (uh) #segamat# [eh] #segamat# [eh] #segamat# malaysia so sorry [ah] I have to say that
why because it really trigger my nerve you know what when you want to do <malay>kad jemputan</malay> it's a wedding card [ah] [eh] so when want to do <malay>kad jemputan</malay> it's like
(um) very straightforward [what] you want the colour
the wording
and the address already in detail and just let them design it you know what happen on that time
