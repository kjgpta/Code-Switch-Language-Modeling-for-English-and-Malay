ya
<malay>bila</malay> [ah] staycation
but then I feel like december [kan] school holiday
(mm) (ugh)
(mmhmm)
Pan Pacific service suite
(um) beach road
because you all going as a family so I thought like you'll be
better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
(mmhmm)
this one you planning to do for <malay>kak</malay> #ain's# birthday right
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
<malay>makan kat mana</malay> for dinner
in pacific
how many
because of the number of adults that you book [kan]
that's why they follow like
ya
[eh] [eh] sorry sorry
(mmhmm)
I think it's easy [seh] if you get like central
central area <malay>lagi kalau nak makan</malay>
[a'ah]
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
<malay>ada</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
is that the kitchen then
<malay>malam-malam lapar ke</malay>
<malay>boleh masak</malay> Maggi
and then
(uh)
ya
like that's what I thought
because since
he's awkward either way
I think you all can go <malay>jalan-jalan dekat</malay> gardens by the bay before that
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya correct
[oh]
<malay>bangun pagi</malay>
usually like who want to <malay>bangun pagi</malay> I cannot <malay>bangun pagi</malay> man
[eh] <malay>kalau</malay> staycation
have you been to the <malay>yang itu</malay> the art museum
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
because they have that interacting <malay>punya</malay>
I forgot the time she I think the one that #mama# went with <malay>kak</malay> #ain# <malay>dekat</malay>
japan <malay>kat</malay> #tokyo# they went to the japan [one]
then #mama# <malay>cakap ada</malay>
like this one this <malay>macam</malay> interacting <malay>nya</malay> board <malay>gitu</malay> so you can draw your own animals
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
[oh] then she excited <malay>macam budak kecil</malay>
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
since [dah] <malay>macam</malay> central central
and then your parents <malay>boleh</malay>
feeling <malay>sikit</malay>
<malay>malam-malam ambilkan gambar</malay>
because I think <malay>dekat</malay> Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
if not I can find for you also [lor]
actually <malay>tengok-tengok</malay> date [lah] but then if you book december right you can use your voucher [mah]
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that [lor]
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
is do you think #aryan# is old enough to <malay>masuk</malay>
(mm) then can <malay>boleh pakai</malay> [seh]
hundred dollars
ya my
(uh huh)
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think #angah# will
this hotel also nice
but you went to Malayan Council before right to <malay>makan</malay>
have you gone before
I think you went before
[oh] is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since #angah# like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
(mm) can [ah]
<malay>makan dekat sana ada</malay> that Noosh Noodle Bar
[ah] if you go the if you go the the art museum [kan] [dah] <malay>dekat</malay> like you walk through the helix bridge <malay>lepas tu</malay> [dah] <malay>belok</malay>
then [dah] <malay>sampai</malay> esplanade what esplanade [kan][dah] <malay>dekat</malay>
at Noosh Noodle Bar
and nak <malay>kalau nak mengopi ada</malay> coffee bean
and then <malay>boleh jalan-jalan</malay> can take photos
[eh] we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
(mm) okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy [ah]
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
<malay>yang dekat</malay> #omotesando#
why didn't you eat it's so good
like you know the japanese they very <malay>macam</malay>
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it <malay>dia</malay> [dah] toast <malay>panas-panas</malay>
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
ya I feel like <malay>semua orang cakap</malay> it's (um) expensive <malay>lagi mahal</malay> but then I feel like if you record [eh] (uh) record <malay>pula</malay> if you (um)
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one <malay>dekat</malay> japan because <malay>dekat</malay> japan they have the regular size and size
<malay>dekat sini</malay> they only have size
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people <malay>nya</malay> mindset <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ni lagi mahal</malay> [seh]
[ah] <malay>berbual</malay> for what
<malay>kat</malay> japan <malay>boleh makan</malay> [pe] but now you're not going japan right so
if you like craving for it just go for it [lah] twenty plus dollars
because I see <malay>dekat macam</malay> online blog <malay>gitu</malay> I feel like it's
okay [lah] <malay>dia macam tak lokek</malay>
because I think they have like fixed
(um) measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
<malay>gitu</malay>
then that time also I had this #yakiniku# you know #yakiniku#
the beef
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one <malay>yang tanya</malay> what is #yakiniku#
Yoshinoya
[oh] no okay #yakiniku# is the
okay [lah] like that is after they #yakiniku# the beef [mah]
but #yakiniku# is basically you get
to grill the the beef
<malay>dekat</malay> the place itself
so they give you raw beef <malay>dia macam</malay> Seoul Garden Seoul Garden <malay>tapi</malay> it's just beef
maybe because they #yakiniku# it in the kitchen you you don't get to do it
but ya
I had the one <malay>dekat</malay> japan also it was so good the halal one
that
that time there was only one halal #yakiniku# outlet
so we went and then we went for (um) during lunch time <malay>dia macam tak</malay> crowded even though there's so many people at the
the #asakusa# temple area
ya
and then they had dish <malay>macam</malay> dish [eh]
they had this <malay>macam</malay>
(um) raw beef set like the bento <malay>tapi</malay> with raw beef
then the griller <malay>dekat depan</malay>
so you get to grill your own <malay>tapi</malay> it's like a bento
it's so nice one of the set was #wagyu# then I'm like
it's so soft [oh] my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
dish is like <malay>lauk</malay> right
I mean it is technically [lah] but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like #mee soto# is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose #mee soto# okay I think I will pick
(um)
<malay>apa</malay>
[a'ah] there's like so many things that I like
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the <malay>roti</malay>
(hmm)
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
<malay>sama macam adik</malay>
but it's a dish [mah] so I thought it's (um) <malay>macam</malay> should be included
okay I think I will choose (um) clam #vongole# #mama# <malay>punya</malay> clam #vongole#
with lots of <malay>cili padi</malay> and (um)
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay
ya that's a dish
if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day which actor would you
want to become and why

the lingerie line
experience

ya then after that I think he used
he used
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
will smith <malay>punya rumah punya gambar</malay>
and then they put there as a meme
!oho! like the circuit breaker
[a'ah]
ya
was like I'm
you all have to stay home today but the celebrities
<malay>dorang jalan jauh-jauh pun</malay> they will stay around their house
[oh] my god
[a'ah]
that's why
[a'ah]
and then they have
[a'ah] movie room ya
<malay>ada macam</malay> living room [a'ah]
I think probably we have the right to complain
!aiya! I think it'll be fun
can you imagine
like I cannot imagine myself
staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
[a'ah]
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
[ah]
ya so that's one of the bad ones
lower on is free
but I actually find that ya I find that a fair deal
then [ah] if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
(um)
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like (uh)
[a'ah]
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
<malay>tapi</malay>
face
face is
<malay>dia</malay> just <malay>kekal</malay>
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
you can be <malay>tak</malay> handsome but then have a good (uh) fit body <malay>tapi</malay> I'm like
once you have a fit body <malay>kalau muka tak</malay> handsome then I'm like

(uh) like for example conjuring <malay>dengan</malay> annabelle
[a'ah]
I don't
I don't think
I think paranormal activity is
(uh) like you know I don't ya
because <malay>dia macam</malay> okay they want to act
make it <malay>macam</malay> as if [oh] <malay>betul betul</malay> happening <malay>betul betul</malay> like
it really happened
[a'ah] the original camera
<malay>abeh macam</malay> if you <malay>macam fikir balik</malay> like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven <malay>gitu</malay>
so I feel like a bit like okay
I mean it's a good <malay>macam</malay>
tactic
something new
maybe <malay>dulu</malay> is a good <malay>macam</malay> good thing for a change [lah]
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
don't know I like the way she tells the story <malay>macam</malay> very interesting like she doesn't <malay>macam</malay> she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam tak</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
you know some people <malay>nanti dorang macam berbual berbual</malay>
and then halfway it gets boring because <malay>macam</malay> too draggy
<malay>tapi</malay> and then this
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
ya I I finished all the ones <malay>dekat</malay> Facebook

(mm) kids
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix <malay>macam</malay> a few years ago I thought <malay>dia baru keluar</malay>

<malay>dia keluar bila</malay> two thousand eight [kan] [eh] two thousand eighteen
the movie <malay>keluar</malay>
[oh] the movie is just recently
[oh] okay okay okay okay okay

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)

I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
<malay>macam</malay> [dah] <malay>lama nak</malay> [lah] like you wish
this can happen you wish
(mmhmm)
<malay>sampai sekarang sama</malay>
or is it
so <malay>dari kecil sampai sekarang</malay> you like
okay like when you

(mmhmm)
I think everybody
<malay>tapi dulu</malay> when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school <malay>kot lupa</malay>
I think primary school
but then it
[oh]
ya then <malay>dia tak serabak</malay> now [lah] like
<malay>ni pun</malay>
(mmhmm)
SARS is just singapore
<malay>tapi</malay> COVID is like
from one country then <malay>lepas tu</malay> another country then <malay>lepas tu tiba-tiba</malay> like the whole world <malay>sampai</malay>
airports <malay>semua tutup</malay> [sia] like
I don't expect
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
father daughter or like kids
(mmhmm)
like <malay>tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam</malay>
what is it [oh] your your
father is infected with COVID so
<malay>nak kena balik kerja</malay>
I think (uh)
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like [oh]
I think like
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this <malay>macam</malay> seriously
like he
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
I mean <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> re-election so I feel like
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going I guess
<malay>tapi macam tu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>korang nak</malay> the COVID to finish
to end to finally like <malay>macam</malay>
no more new cases <malay>tu semua</malay> everybody to heal
until <malay>tak nak dengar</malay> like to wear mask wash your hands
be hygienic
<malay>tapi orang tak nak dengar</malay> then like
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a !duh!
<malay>esok kerja</malay> [eh]
[oh] ya ya ya
#sembawang#
<malay>esok kerja petang</malay> [seh]
you know my <malay>tempat kerja ada budak baru</malay>
who
it's a malay guy then he <malay>budak</malay> T
he's like so young
ya
he's on internship and because I thought when he <malay>masuk</malay>
usually <malay>kalau</malay>
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
[oh] I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so <malay>macam terkejut</malay> like [oh] you from polytechnic I'm like [oh] ya
interning gag
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the <malay>macam</malay>
grants and all that
like you know the courses <malay>tu semua</malay> how the works <malay>tapi macam</malay>
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
<malay>macam</malay> sensitive issue [lah] because they usually <malay>macam</malay>
deal with <malay>macam</malay> money money (um) <malay>orang bayarkan</malay>
<malay>dorang bayar duit tu</malay> join courses <malay>tu semua</malay> so maybe they like
because
that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
so they will only let the senior <malay>yang kerja lama kat sana tu</malay>
so <malay>kita orang</malay> usually <malay>ada</malay>
<malay>kita duduk</malay> counter [jer] <malay>kat</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> office [ah]
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries [lor]
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card [lah]
so [dah] passion card <malay>layan tu ni</malay> but then
I think they like
people
from other working at other places [eh] like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the
to (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> apply for you know the
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under [lah] then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
under <malay>macam</malay> not everything can <malay>buat</malay> right
[a'ah] especially <malay>kalau macam</malay> the
issue is about government <malay>punya duit</malay> like government <malay>bagi duit</malay> because of this COVID right so they'll think like
ya
so when they
they already like refer them to us then after that <malay>kita orang macam</malay> then they come to the then after that we tell them that
[oh] (um) we actually this this grant is not under us so
then you know <malay>macam tak</malay> happy [lah]
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the cannot do all these
ya then after that the other day got this one <malay>makcik</malay> [lah] she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
because it's also [what]
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
we cannot even like use other people <malay>punya</malay> computer
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's [mah]
I mean like okay [lah] if you allowed there's there's
your issue [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> for us is sensitive because
<malay>sekali kalau apa-apa</malay> ya
<malay>sekali</malay> your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day (uh)
the right
they referred this resident to
to the to change their address their
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
<malay>jap tengok dia punya</malay> battery
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your (uh) at the but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the then I'm like !huh!
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got resident they come to the and they like
(uh) can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
ya so I said go to but then <malay>dorang cakap</malay> [ah] very far I cannot walk and all
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
(hmm)(hmm)
not everything we can do at
so funny
and then some people they understand [lah] but then you know some people when they like
[oh] but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit <malay>leceh</malay> so far
<malay>adik</malay> stop
[a'ah]
that's why I say
[ah]
because now
now also everything is online
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
need to go down (mmhmm)
[a'ah]
ya it's like that so yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
<malay>dia cakap</malay> she applied
the (um) financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> she passed away
as in the application that the application for the
that means the person <malay>punya</malay> mum
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot [lah] because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but then they keep like arguing <malay>macam</malay>
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
especially if it's like racial issue <malay>macam</malay>
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a <malay>makcik</malay> who came
if there's a <malay>makcik</malay> who come by
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
<malay>tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita</malay> [kan] <malay>melayu</malay>
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
so it's like that my <malay>kerja</malay> is like that
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the for a bit any longer
because by right I use
(mm) ya
at the
ya
ya
(uh) as a housing officer <malay>dekat</malay> dormitory <malay>punya</malay> office
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the
(mm) I'll be in the office [lor] so basically <malay>kalau</malay> that office is for the foreign workers <malay>kalau</malay> let's say they have
issues with the
employers
[ah]
because they (um) employees from different different company [mah] so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
(uh)
pay them on time <malay>ke apa</malay> like this kind of problem they will come to the office and <malay>tu</malay>
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like [oh]
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office [what]
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing <malay>macam</malay> roundings <malay>ke apa ke</malay> so you like
just be mentally prepared [lor]
