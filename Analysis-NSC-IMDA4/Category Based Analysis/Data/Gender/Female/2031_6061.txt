<malay>tepuk</malay> [eh] <malay>tepuk</malay>
alright here we are today what's up talking via this audio recording <malay>dan juga di</malay> zoom recording (err) <malay>macam</malay>
maybe
yup there's a lot
joe biden
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
yup
<malay>kejap</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tahu kau punya</malay> audio recording <malay>apa ni ada</malay> there's another additional sounds
like like video station
no [eh]
[a'ah] I haven't mind so I don't know is it because of my (um)
earpiece I mean headset or
it's just between like this audio recording and then in front of me is his phone recording thing
let me adjust a little bit
ya
they they you know like like you go for surgery and then can hear all this
ya that's that's crazy
okay yup so let's just
do it ya so today I've been watching like people comments via instagram
so <malay>aku tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>ada orang orang ni</malay> like there're influencers in itself so what happen is when <malay>aku tengok dia punya</malay> comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
candidates there's two of them
(err) <malay>apa</malay> president the vice president
(um) I mean people have their own perspective and opinion [lah] but I think for those who support with the current winner apparently <malay>kena kena kata orang kena</malay> trashed <malay>kena</malay> slammed
<malay>aku tak sangka</malay> that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like [oh] my god I can't believe this your statement I'm gonna unfollow you
you know and they are very vocal they are just everywhere
but
the loyalty is not there towards the influencers already because they voice out except for those who has been voicing out at the beginning
[ah] <malay>itu kau boleh nampak</malay> different [lah] because
from that day onwards I'm sure <malay>si</malay> trump <malay>punya</malay> followers <malay>pun macam</malay> K I'm gonna unfollow you I'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear [lah] they just love to comments that's why I said there's a lot of them I'm like so surprised
and we just looking to <malay>apa ni</malay> (um) <malay>barang-barang yang kau boleh beli</malay> via Carousell
Facebook
toilet brush
toilet brushes crazy and socks with his hair
souvenir ya man I read
I didn't expect the socks like with his okay there's a design of his coat that he always used to wear I mean and then what else the tie definitely his face and that orange chair it's like three D version you can it's a pop out hair on your socks
<malay>nak beli</malay> [eh] ya that's crazy man like
that ya three three fifty I'm gonna buy the toilet brush
without orange sure ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya
three quarter pants ya ya definitely you have to wear shorts
cannot see
it's gonna be like the mock of the day like you're going to be the next celebrity everyone [eh] can I take a picture of you and your socks
[oh] my god
whenever
over his socks at the first place will sell it
ya man admits
and that's madness man
what else [ah] that's what we've been watching today browsing through all the trump's (um) collaterals made
there are merchandise ya he like making a lot of business on his presidency like !wah! didn't expect that but ya [lah] coming from a background of a businessman of course
and ya
plan B [lah] but sometime good [eh] <malay>kalau kita orang sekarang kena</malay> <malay>berwawasan sikit</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam dia</malay> [lah] <malay>dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia</malay> very determined [eh] <malay>tak malu</malay> [ah] so this kind of people actually it's good for (err) business [lah] actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
but as a leader will be different game altogether [lah]
ya talking about that today what we did we did a lot of movie marathons
(um)
ya
which one there're like dank
[oh] the knives out and you knockout excuse me why don't we talk about the previous before you knockout
the knives out okay
yup
(mmhmm)
ya
ya if people watched [lah]
yup
one suspect it's like I only kind of suspect him towards close to the end
(err) he is giving it away already [lah]
(uh) so I think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he <malay>siasat dia punya</malay> prime suspect
I think it's a good twist [ah] it's always like that anyway that's how movie works
ya
ya <malay>jangan tidur jangan tidur</malay>
<malay>sabar sama sama</malay> so <malay>semalam aku</malay> knockout then I just <malay>bangun balik perasan</malay> it's really really damn good movie
yup then what else we watched (um)
[ah] witchcraft
the craft
the best
ya so <malay>kalau korang ingat</malay> back in the days (err) maybe in nineties
<malay>kalau korang tengok</malay> the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them [lah] so <malay>siapa-siapa</malay> try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
ya one spell at the time
<malay>tapi</malay>
(mmhmm)
in school ya
ya
so <malay>yang dia mati tu</malay> eventually it's there's another plot twist [lah] all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
then ya I think you guys should watch [lah] it it's
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really <malay>walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat</malay>
ya (err) but it's still fine you know it is very interesting
thrill [lah]
thrilled
okay
<malay>apa lagi</malay> ya
(mm)
the nun (mm) (hmm) (mm)
the nun definitely <malay>mata kau buka besar-besar</malay> [ah]

the the ya
his madness is crazy [lah]
so this man doesn't let her off easily [ah] [kan] surrounded with <malay>dekat orang gaduh</malay> [kan] so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something <malay>kadangkala macam tu tak</malay> make sense <malay>aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini</malay> like <malay>kata orang dah</malay> you are negative by itself so the <malay>banyak amarah yang belum</malay> unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing

we saw the <malay>makcik</malay> [eh] in the botanical garden
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
I think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in #pulau ubin# or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
some <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] <malay>rabak gila</malay> [ah]
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
[ah] there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and I almost like strangle around cause I was still scared
I was like grabbing her neck I didn't realise that just crazy
she is gonna be conjuring two

(mm)
I'm in a mess I'm in panic mode

(mm) (mm)
<malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh huh) (uh huh)
to whack [ah] (uh)
!aiyo! so crazy [oh] so now <malay>kita nak kena bawa kayu</malay> [eh] to frighten them [ah]
[ah] singapore <malay>ni</malay> monkey <malay>kayu jalan</malay> #weh# <malay>tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik</malay>
!oi!
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal I don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really [ah]
I went I went ostrich farm
then
[ah]
they don't really like (um) sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich K the one I went is a malaysia ostrich
[oh] ya man no kangaroo I got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to <malay>macam kasi makan</malay>
and the baby like bathing the babies
but I didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me <malay>mampus</malay> [sia] ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like (uh) we bought quite a bit [ah] <malay>tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan</malay> [seh] like we bought like two two or one [eh] I don't remember
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
get fed by us [ah] the the time [ah] and then <malay>ada kasi makanan dia apa</malay> so at the end <malay>kita kasi dengan</malay>
is it birds
birds and <malay>ni</malay> [kan] the ducks
they them <malay>datang</malay> [ah]
I like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
(uh huh)
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so I rather do staycation which I'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in now we can't go there at all
I was
ya
for the living room gonna have [leh]
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
(mmhmm)
[oh]
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous [ah]
now cause
[oh] my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
I hope that
[oh] what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve [sia]
just crucial
ya
that's definitely but my (um) in my thought is like <malay>kalau pasal kita balik</malay> like
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else [ah] food (err) shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back I think I felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time I felt that fight of crime might be higher
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always <malay>nasib kalau kena tak kena</malay> but I think this is gonna go higher because they are
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
they have the
assertion
two weeks
(mm) higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two I didn't really keep track of what's happening about COVID
it's getting vary and
I don't know [lah] what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was [ah]
the worst pandemic
and I can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself [lah] he got COVID and then cured after few days the hell
we all know COVID is not easy thing for those who <malay>kena</malay>
hospitalised
ya
[kan]
[ah]
(uh huh)
same ya
phase two
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think the annoying part is like okay [ah] aside from business [lah] like how the work function now is
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government <malay>punya</malay> you know command
so (um)
how how do I put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau tahu benda ni dah</malay> badly affected and I think when we talk about <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
ya <malay>tapi aku rasa</malay>
I don't see that we are <malay>macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena</malay> push in so <malay>macam</malay>
okay like I know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know I'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment [ah] rather than other things
so ya I think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible [lah]
both
ya so I don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
<malay>atau</malay> it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online [lah] [kan]
I mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course (err) because of your work function [ah] but other than that if there's not a need then I felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
ya there the other thing is your <malay>kerja jalan</malay> [lah] unless <malay>kau kena</malay> micromanaged by your own company [ah] so
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office [oh]
it depends on your work already [mah]
ya man yo so <malay>kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit</malay> [eh] <malay>lima belas minit</malay> [ah]
ya
ya
(mm)
yup
ya
ya especially I think weddings [ah] weddings most affected [ah]
a batches
ya so we got our friend wedding coming up in november
(err) but eventually I think we they she have to be very selective [lah] who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person [ah] that kind of thing [ah] but also she can't be very
restrict [lah] about two who would potentially can be invited
and those are not definitely feel <malay>macam</malay> [ah] you know I mean
(um)
it's just (err) sad [lah] didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
that's not easy you know especially for a <malay>pengantin</malay> [ah]
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and (err) <malay>ramai meriahkan</malay> wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of <malay>kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap</malay> I felt that that's how it is [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
yup
(mmhmm)
ya
(um) (hmm)
ya must come to terms [lah]
so I think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
unless unless you no need to <malay>macam</malay> invite people <malay>dia macam</malay> immediate family <malay>kau nak</malay> totally <malay>buat kecil-kecil</malay> just make sure everything <malay>sah</malay> then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then I think is not the time yet [lah] <malay>kalau kau betul</malay> wedding <malay>kau</malay> grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't [lah] not the time yet
really
<malay>kalau korang</malay> just <malay>sebab ada</malay> mum is there then just go ahead [lah]
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
ya I think <malay>kalau cakap sah ni</malay> and <malay>dia pun ada</malay> the elderly [lah]
so <malay>pasal kalau keluar</malay> [kan] <malay>orang</malay> wear mask [kan] and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
the the the fact that I also like after I climb the stairs then afterwards I feel out of breath wearing the mask
ya have to
you know you're like
and then like the air at the air is like in your mouth [eh] it's not breathing out
ya
I see so so the elderly like most affected to it so they'd rather stay home and when they stay home too long also it's problem cause they don't really being active outside
mentally also so they always I think now they gone crazy with social media and Facebook Instagram all this or YouTube
because that's their main entertainment like <malay>kalau dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>kita keluar</malay> I think they always go out go where <malay>pasar</malay> #geylang# [ah]
[ah] little india or wherever a shopping mall <malay>ke</malay> or visiting the bazaar <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>membawang</malay> [kan]
it's the best thing for them [lah]
#mengopi# [lah] <malay>mengumpat</malay> [lah] whatever [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay> stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
social media the next thing [ah]
so I think they are becoming like the oldest millennial
millennial like a little bit too late but it's getting there for for not a good reason
ya in their fifties and nineteen forty seven
I'm like fifty something ya and then now they started to like uploading things on Facebook try to get to know the the the rad the world of online it's madness
