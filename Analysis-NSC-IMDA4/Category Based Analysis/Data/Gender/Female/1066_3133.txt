<malay>atas</malay> view of orchard <malay>tapi</malay> (err) in a budget hotel
(um)
I mean okay [lah] I mean considering <malay>dia punya apa tu</malay> space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite <malay>macam</malay> convenient and comfortable because <malay>macam</malay> very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because <malay>macam</malay> like you have to walk through the <malay>lorong</malay> and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like [ah] okay
I hate it [oh] my god <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>betul betul</malay> self-conscious [sia] [oh] my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare <malay>kalau</malay> like #terglare# and then you like [oh] no
okay thank you thank you
ya of course I need to make sure that it's all covered
I very self-conscious about my body
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we <malay>datang selalu</malay> [kan] so
ya then you have to wait [lah] queue then wait for the aunty to like okay <malay>adik berapa orang</malay> okay <malay>dua orang duduk</malay> okay [ah]
<malay>adik</malay> also it's not <malay>abang</malay> okay it's <malay>adik</malay> cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know [lah] but he look I call him <malay>adik</malay> cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him [ah] <malay>adik nasi ayam dua</malay> I tell you it'll be so insulting
ya so the thing is now you have wearing masks right he can't really see how our faces look like all or our facial expression so I think it's fine
we'll be like <malay>adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal</malay>
no no but (err) okay [lah] that time I order also he he got my order quite well so okay [lah]
it's funny how like this is one of our first few time seeing a male
shopkeeper
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with (uh) female <malay>punya</malay> shopkeeper <malay>yang macam</malay> fierce and <malay>garang</malay> right
<malay>nak apa dik nak apa</malay> !huh! <malay>makan</malay> [lah] <malay>dik semua tak nak</malay>
ya so <malay>macam</malay> like [oh] okay [lah] maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza <malay>sahaja</malay> so I think because you see [eh] the near <malay>nenek atau mak tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya atuk ke apa</malay> they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause <malay>dorang tahu macam</malay> [orh] [ah] <malay>nak pakcik ni</malay> cute [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia selalu</malay> smiling
I I prefer it that way seriously because ya cause if not it's causing inconvenience to other people
no like you eating people starring is fine but if you were to eat and laugh and like [jer] take your own damn sweet time yes you deserve to be skewered
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially <malay>kalau</malay> queue <malay>makanan kau sampai</malay> of course you want to <malay>cepat-cepat kasi habis</malay> [pe]
I think that time the first few times that we went was when we were in school and it was no no it was after lunch hour
okay either way is before or after lunch hour it's not during lunch hour so you can still eat and talk ya
you mean <malay>angkat ayam merah</malay> [oh] ya
[oh] <malay>yang kat tepi</malay> (err)
I think we we bought from there before
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
why
it's okay with fish [mah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[ah] yes [lah]
no you that's the thing you know when it comes to this kind of health issue [kan] sometimes you can be really healthy and all that but it will still happen to you
(mm) I mean <malay>macam</malay> like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] ya his diabetic <malay>punya</malay> reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends [ah] I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
all this while
he did this [one] going on for a couple of years [what] it's just that <malay>macam</malay> he only started <malay>yang</malay> exercise is much more rigorous because (err) he goes I mean he eventually found like <malay>kaki</malay> to you know run and all there and then you know [lah] people <malay>kat sana dorang selalu macam nak</malay>
<malay>buat apa tu</malay> compete <malay>siapa lari lagi banyak</malay> and all that ya
so that's the thing [ah] like he's always been like exercising if he's not running he'll be cycling you know that kind of thing
first thirty years of his life
[oh] ya ya forgot
actually I don't know because I only know them I only know him from twenty six years and above
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby <malay>orang macam</malay> like [oh] they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends [lah] so it's always good to always
(uh) check whether you <malay>punya</malay> you know levels okay <malay>ke tak</malay>
but you never know I very I very scared like I'm always get go home girl checks is like
no [lah] you just tell it for yourself or for your family [lah] the I think that's about it
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
it's very frustrating [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like especially for my brother-in-law cause <malay>dia dah</malay> yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so <malay>boleh naik pangkat</malay>
ya
ya exactly but because doctor <malay>kata dia ada</malay> this certain levels you know that kind of thing so <malay>dia tak boleh ambil</malay> [ah] ya so he needs to be <malay>macam semua</malay> okay so that he can resume taking then <malay>lepas tu baru dia boleh</malay> considered for (uh) promotion
(mm) I mean like you will be wondering [lah] so I remember <malay>macam</malay> like on <malay>sangat kuruskan badan</malay> [lah] and all that because ya he's stuck there because like <malay>macam</malay> they said that [oh] because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted <malay>macam tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
it was really tricky [ah] ya I would suggest him like go go and meet a dietitian or something so that they can look at meal plans
not ya this is going to be a long period [lah] <malay>mana boleh</malay> overnight <malay>turn kau ni pun</malay>
so ya so (um) I mean I was telling [lah] maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I <malay>nak turunkan</malay> my [eh] my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor just <malay>untuk</malay> check <malay>dia punya apa tu</malay> blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with <malay>macam</malay> like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that <malay>main pun gila</malay> so <malay>aku marah dengan kakak</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
damn
but just <malay>tauge</malay> because (err) okay
(mm) gym-ing I don't know
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like <malay>macam</malay> you want to be healthy then okay [lor] unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that <malay>tapi setakat macam nak</malay> like show off then (ugh)
maybe that's how they see it as a form of motivation [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
I like <malay>apa tu</malay> make your own plans [lah] as
is it
I don't reply
[oh]
okay okay got it
ya I got it I got it
I mean I don't know whether it's just downright creepy or is it just like very sweet like !aww! you keep track of my life thanks
that's true [lah] that's true [lah]
no more like my father is <malay>atas</malay> not us we're not there yet
you can go shop and see what's there for cyber monday
no [lah] as in like just see [lah] like [oh] you guys have any like special promotion for cyber monday
ya I know cyber money means like online [lah] but you know you never know you can just walk around and like [eh] #terbump# into a shop [eh] got promo [ah]
<malay>apanya yang</malay> birch car <malay>punya</malay> skirt
I you need to refresh my memory
[oh] okay okay (uh) <malay>yang baju lengan pendek tu</malay> [ah] okay okay
but now it's available <malay>kau tak nak beli</malay>
<malay>beli satu</malay> [jer]
(mm) (mm) it's really about whether or not (um) you <malay>nak</malay> better details but you need to take care of the material <malay>ataupun</malay>
and specifically <malay>macam</malay> like you do not have menses on that day
how much is it
no you want to buy three
but okay [lah] I mean have you been buying clothes recently
[oh] okay okay then you need to rethink I buy my clothes every six months
serious
ya I know but it's like okay for me is when I buy I will buy like
four or five pieces of clothing on depends [ah] sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait <malay>macam</malay> cause I <malay>beli tengah</malay> mid year sale <malay>atau</malay> end year sale
and then I will purposely go <malay>bila</malay> (err) towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many (err) options for me so I just make do with what's available [lah]
ya [lah] I think design sizes it's it's all together [mah] like you will see something that's in your size by it's not what you want and it's you know you want this particular design but the size is not available so technically you'd (mm) just see which one is (um)
you know like okay [lah] <malay>boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana</malay> which explains my poor choices of clothing lately [lah] it's really <malay>makcik makcik bodoh</malay> but then
<malay>ada ada yang teruk</malay> [lah] <malay>aku macam terjujur juga</malay>
I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon
no [lah] as in you'll still buy but not as often as before
(mm) (mm) no but you must also always set aside something [lah] like for your self-care and all that <malay>tapi</malay> it's just with self-care fund that you <malay>dah</malay> set aside you have to really properly choose your battle [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like I <malay>nak pergi</malay> let's say [lah] pedi mani mani pedi <malay>ke lagi</malay> massage <malay>ke</malay> you know
(um) hair treatment <malay>ke</malay> so it's really <malay>macam</malay> you have to choose one of those <malay>macam</malay> ya
<malay>macam</malay> staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> like I <malay>nak pergi</malay> staycay then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak buat kuku</malay> I I <malay>nak buat rambut</malay> I no no such thing ya
exactly ya so it's really choosing your battles [lah]
(mm) (mm)
maintain [lah] <malay>bengok</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm) of course ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
no it's really about <malay>macam</malay> the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so nobody knows like if you wear this top I don't even know I didn't even remember that you bought it at H&M at #melaka# [oh] it's a very comfortable sweater
ya so technically <malay>kalau macam begitu</malay>
<malay>kalau macam begitu</malay> [lah] it really depends actually ya (um) you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya <malay>murah tak kesah asalkan</malay> okay [lah] you <malay>guna</malay> [kan]
<malay>kat</malay> ion yes
ya ya I mean if you want I mean I mean it'll be better if we actually left earlier just now [lah] so you get you get what you are looking for
I mean if don't have also you can always <malay>pergi dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena</malay> inject <malay>kat</malay> (uh) spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
ya so basically ya if it didn't work if it doesn't work out today you can always bring him tomorrow [lah]
then <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>naik</malay> Grab (mm)
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just (uh) call the hospital just to inform and then after that (err) tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting [lah] than <malay>daripada</malay> keep quiet call <malay>kena</malay> towed away you know we don't want that to happen
I don't know because if it's been there and no one claimed it they will also want to remove it in case [orh] other people want to use the slot and all that
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there <malay>bodoh</malay> [sia]
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time [eh] <malay>motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak</malay>
(mm) (mm) so ya [lah] <malay>nak kena kena</malay> actually call or inform at least just to check
(mm) ya
very smart boy
(mm) I mean you can always check back with the doctor [lah] like is it normal to feel this way
(mm) (mm) (mm)
[ah] okay okay
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before <malay>tapi</malay>
no never because I think because of location <malay>macam</malay>

!yay!
ya so far so <malay>tak tak hairan</malay> [lah]
(mm) okay okay
okay [lah] I'm actually quite excited [lah] looking forward to it cause I don't know what to expect and the I think it's quite been it's been quite a long time since I last had steak
ya I think the last time we had steak was (um) last year at Elfuego
ya
ya [lah] that was even later you know that was in october ya so the <malay>paling</malay> recent <malay>pun</malay>
in december
ya can you imagine [oh] my god <malay>letak</malay> the kids at home I need to get them out

I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain <malay>kat sana tengok momok</malay>
gross
I mean you can see [lah] from the pictures but you don't have to book
ya the thing is <malay>kadang kala</malay> how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean <malay>kalau nak kata</malay> [kan] #pulau ubin# okay [lah] [eh] but you you don't need a passport for that <malay>tapi</malay> I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon [ah] maybe like <malay>macam pertengahan</malay> twenty twenty one
I <malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>aku mana tahu</malay>
they delayed because (err) <malay>tiba-tiba ada</malay> the spike in the number of cases [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] serious [ah] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] okay okay
so they have an office there [lah] actually
and sketchy <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya it's true
sure [lor]
I think <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>kat</malay> thailand <malay>macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk</malay> would be <malay>macam kat</malay> (um) malaysia
because I think number of cases so far <malay>yang dorang</malay> report <malay>kat</malay> news thailand <malay>macam tak ada</malay> [jer]
mean <malay>ada yang tempat</malay> rural <malay>ke</malay>
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right <malay>bodoh</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) understand understand
but there are some states just living in denial
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay [lah] <malay>kasut kau orang</malay> [lah] I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any (err) medical attention if they ever get COVID
(mm)
all over the country [oh] <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] good job
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) <malay>tengok</malay> [jer] [lah]
[ah] natural selection
(mm)
(mmhmm)
how sure are you there are the same group of people <malay>mungkin tak</malay> [lah] <malay>ada tapi segelintir</malay>
<malay>daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni</malay> then you like [ah] <malay>korang minta kena sepak</malay>
ya you know that time <malay>dekat</malay> asia one [kan] <malay>tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam</malay> train <malay>tak pakai</malay> mask <malay>bodoh betul</malay>
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador <malay>atau</malay> the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like <malay>kadang-kadang orang</malay> singapore <malay>ini</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang banyak</malay> complain <malay>banyak ambil gambar banyak</malay> submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>segelintir</malay>
[ah]
<malay>dia kena saman</malay>
no <malay>dia kena saman</malay> lazarus island <malay>pun sama semua kena saman</malay>
no no no jail
why would you wanna jail them
you cannot jail people immediately just for that one incident [what]
I feel like you <malay>kalau</malay> jail <malay>yang perempuan yang kata mana tak</malay>
[ah]
ya that [one] she does it she did it repeatedly <malay>kalau</malay> you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time <malay>tak serik</malay> second time <malay>tak serik</malay>
you think these people got no money [meh] to pay
ya [lah] but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone [lah] like got the first time okay <malay>kalau kau buat lagi</malay> then that's it <malay>kau minta kena sepak</malay> you know that kind of thing
(mm)
<malay>apa dia</malay> we have what
(mm) (mm)
no the thing is #adela# they have different arrangement #adela# so <malay>macam</malay> like offices right now right they said [ah] cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that <malay>macam</malay>
screen divider for every table and then when you're at your table you must wear mask at all times
so they have certain measures [lah]
ya except when I eat [lah]
[orh]
ya so there's there's rules and regulation [lah] it's not like they just say okay maximum fifty do whatever you want no you still have certain things that you have to follow
(mm)
ya must wear in case like people from the other (um) you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you [ah] getting that [lah]
(mm)
but the mask is the cause of breakouts
it's like I have really dry skin on my chin I'm so annoyed [oh] my god
[kan] <malay>begini</malay> [ah] [seh]
the below the eyes cannot make it [lah] [ah]
#khatib# #khatib# <malay>kat mana ni</malay>
[oh] <malay>kat</malay> #yishun# <malay>itu</malay>
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> [ah] ya ya I wanted to ask him <malay>mana</malay> then I I saw HomeTeam
okay I don't mind going there
<malay>panjat panjat panjat</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
of course of course of course
no I'll be like yes this is the time for me to show my skills of climbing away from responsibility
(uh)
then I will avoid like now you see me now you can't
but <malay>ada</malay> [lah] I've been avoiding arrows so much
arrow at work okay [lah] it's still it's part of my job but arrow other things in life and I'm actually quite good at it I'm good at manoeuvring my way out of this situations
thanks thanks
I mean like I can arrow out of so many situation until people go back to the person they broke up with
it's it's the same skill
!alah! <malay>kesian</malay>
maybe should just put disclaimer I'm really nice please don't take my niceness wrongly you know <malay>macam cerita</malay> a walk to remember please don't fall in love with me
aha
[oh] ya that's true <malay>dorang</malay> just <malay>bengat gila</malay> [sia]

<malay>ku baik salah ku tak baik salah semua adiknya pergi mampus</malay> [lah]
I think no [lah] maybe just because like I don't know maybe <malay>dorang main</malay> game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to <malay>macam</malay> vent you know <malay>dekat rumah</malay> you know that kind of thing
okay [jer] [lah] <malay>aku dah biasa benda begini</malay>
[ah]
like ya like I even have my favourite <malay>buaya</malay> at (uh)
no [lah] because you know <malay>kat</malay> malaysia [kan] <malay>ada satu</malay> video <malay>ni</malay> the mum <malay>ke</malay> the father ask the the child <malay>bunyi ayam macam mana bunyi kucing macam mana bunyi itik macam mana</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> and then <malay>bunyi buaya macam mana</malay> the <malay>bunyi buaya</malay> is hi <malay>sayang</malay>
ya so what I mean my favourite <malay>buaya</malay> is I have this one player who always use the same line on me every single time we play
so I was like [eh] <malay>buaya</malay> favourite I and then he's like hi <malay>sayang</malay> still <malay>bisik-bisik nak tidur</malay> [kan] [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>tahu</malay>
I'll be like <malay>pergi mampus boleh</malay> ya
(mm) (mm)
(uh) ya usually do that in the presence of other guys then they'll be like <malay>kau yang buaya</malay> [lah] [sia]
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku malas layan tu kalau dorang mengamuk tu antara bini dengan dia bukan aku nya pasal</malay>
!alah! <malay>kesian</malay>
[kan] you <malay>main</malay> game [lah] <malay>belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>main</malay> game
ya accept me for who I am
(ugh)
I'm just saying it works both ways
(mm)
I mean <malay>nak kena ada</malay> schedule [lah] like okay my previous clan right (err)
they they are they are they are all muslim married and they have children and all that so what they do is (uh) they they actually actually agreed with their wife <malay>tahu macam</malay> okay I will settle everything I will take care of the kids you know homework and all that but then I will play I will have my playing time from nine thirty onwards
is is is is surprising because you know why <malay>pasal mereka berbual dalam</malay> telephone [kan] [eh] <malay>dalam</malay> game okay <malay>abang dah habis ngaji bang</malay> okay <malay>sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur</malay> [eh]
<malay>adik adik macam mana adik</malay> homework <malay>dah habis ke dik</malay> okay <malay>kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah</malay> check <malay>nanti adik boleh tidur</malay>
ya
no they don't talk [lah] during the game
no I'm talking about different types of people I was talking about my previous clan
[ah] so they know how to
ya ya ya ya [ah] [ah]
ya
[ah]
so it's normal [lah] I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know (err) really manage time and all that <malay>tapi ada tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang macam bengap semacam</malay>
I mean like there are a few <malay>macam</malay> like shirk responsibility <malay>sanggup balik rumah lambat</malay> and all that <malay>pasal nak main</malay> game <malay>kat luar</malay>
<malay>tak tahu mana aku tahu</malay> but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought <malay>dia belum kahwin tahu</malay> because (uh) my that time my friend was like <malay>kau dekat rumah bujang</malay> (uh) (uh) then I was like <malay>rumah bujang</malay> then after that I ask my friend then I said <malay>rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam</malay> like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck <malay>tapi dorang mana rumah</malay> flat <malay>kat situ</malay> [kan] so is <malay>macam</malay> like those
<malay>pondok-pondok</malay> like <malay>kosong</malay> like people rest
(mm) (mm) <malay>macam itu</malay> [lah] along the road <malay>ada satu</malay> (err) so that's what they call <malay>rumah bujang</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak tak tepi</malay> road [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] correct ya ya correct [ah] [ah] [ah] [lah] [sial]
then <malay>aku</malay> <malay>aku macam</malay> cause <malay>nanti dia macam</malay> like okay <malay>aku nak balik</malay>
then like and then I'll be like
[eh] <malay>kat mana ni sekarang</malay>
[eh] <malay>lawa kat rumah bujang ni</malay> then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group [ah] the lobby right
<malay>dia tanya kau orang</malay> [eh]
(uh) <malay>rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> like okay <malay>rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke</malay> and then he's like <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] you <malay>tanya dia sendiri</malay>
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person [lah] I said <malay>asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri</malay> (err) <malay>dia kata kat rumah dia punya</malay> internet <malay>tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ</malay>
fair enough because like <malay>macam awak</malay> that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the <malay>hutan</malay>
ya so I'm like okay [lah] fair enough [lah] <malay>desak kau kau buat apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>kimak</malay>
ya [lah] data <malay>pun tak boleh</malay>
#adela# I
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research <malay>tak bagus</malay> data <malay>pun tak bagus</malay>
[ah]
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's <malay>kat</malay> itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite <malay>macam</malay> low to medium right depending [ah]
they also experience bad reception [leh] and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then [kan]
<malay>nanti macam macam dorang kata bagus tapi aku dah tukar macam tak bagus tukar balik tukar balik</malay>
ya
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos [lah] <malay>lepas</malay> !alah!
[kan] <malay>macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil</malay>
video
#mashallah#
ya ya I do that <malay>tapi nak kena ada</malay> portable charger [lah] or maybe (mm) (mm) (mm)
cause I need to know how long is the road trip going to be if it's gonna be like for eight hours long obviously I'm not gonna game because I need my phone to be alive
<malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> like (err) either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul betul</malay>
!oi!
[oh] really when
all the best girl
okay
[oh] my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
it's literally <malay>macam cucuk selah</malay>
[oh] my god it was painful I was like just
[oh] my god
<malay>apa pasal aku berdarah</malay> [sia] <malay>kat bawah</malay>
[ah]
like I feel like I fell like <malay>macam</malay> I be right again
feel so hurt
so <malay>macam lepas tu aku pergi</malay> toilet [kan] I <malay>kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah</malay> I was like
<malay>takut bilang kau</malay> that time
<malay>akunya akunya benda baik balik</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay>
[eh] but it really hurts [ah] it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist [lah]
is because it's really <malay>macam masuk</malay> then <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> clamp <malay>sakit bodoh</malay>
<malay>kau belum kena lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>berbual banyak</malay> !huh!
<malay>apa dia</malay>
what do you mean by lube
[oh] lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
they do put the <malay>benda macam</malay> gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that [one] they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay [lah]
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that <malay>cuma</malay> like the initial part a bit painful [lah]
ya
it depends [lah] like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the <malay>cepat</malay> and you get the result on the spot also
ya ya correct
(mm) (mm)
ya so no worry [lah] I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check (err) about her the ovaries her uterus
[ah] <malay>kalau ada</malay> fibroid <malay>ke tak</malay> so <malay>buat buat sekali</malay> [lah] and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like <malay>macam</malay> like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like <malay>begini sudah beranak dua</malay> no I said no I said I said <malay>dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising</malay> and then when I <malay>kena</malay>
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her <malay>sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit</malay> she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like <malay>sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya</malay> then she's like <malay>baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan</malay>
then I was like
<malay>ada ambil</malay> [ah]
[eh] but then when I was at the clinic <malay>ini</malay> [kan] it's so awkward
because <malay>semua orang datang dengan dorang punya</malay> partner I went there alone
and then the lady just the reception's like madam #fadilah# I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
<malay>tak tahu apa nak buat kesian</malay> like husband <malay>pandai buat</malay> you know that kind of thing
(mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>bila nak</malay> penetrate <malay>semua nak</malay> ya <malay>bodohnya jantan</malay>
ya <malay>depan belakang tak boleh</malay> okay <malay>pusat pun boleh</malay>
<malay>pusat tak boleh telinga hidung semua masuk</malay>
ya
ya <malay>air air</malay> I also quite a number of people [lah] you know people in who had late pregnancies then I see teenagers with their mum it's so it's quite sad actually
(mm) and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
like I pretend <malay>macam dengar</malay> music <malay>daripada hal</malay>
[ah] Spotify off
and
ya and but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
<malay>tak nampak</malay> pregnant [ah] <malay>tapi dia macam nangis</malay> [lah] but I wanted to tell the mum like you're doing a great job ya
ya
so like then I didn't say [lah] I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
[eh] [eh]
unless <malay>ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm) <malay>lepas beranak</malay> [ah] (mm) (mm)
(mm)
seventeen
(mm) (mm)
I I no okay [lah] I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya [oh] my god
but I feel like for them like sexual education had to start like really early you know
<malay>macam</malay> like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not !aduh! what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about <malay>macam</malay> how to have sex responsibly or safely
then throw outside [lah]
not strong [ah]
<malay>pakai tu</malay> [lah] saran wrap
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya because (err) (err) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> you know before when they did that ligation right maybe an egg has already been released
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after menstrual cycle
(mm) (mm)
ya
[orh] okay
I mean it's good [lah] then she has options you know that kind of thing
catch ball [mah] that's why
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
but it's quite worrying [ah] I I think it's happening in singapore it's just that we are not
very conservative [ah] mindset
damn girl where do you get access
