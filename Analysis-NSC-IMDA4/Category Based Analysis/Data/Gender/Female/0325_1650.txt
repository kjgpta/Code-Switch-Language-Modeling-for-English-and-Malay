I don't know if I got tell you before like I keep forgetting I think I told I told #Wati#</P2> or some shit but like me me and this girl right we met in (um)
<malay>madrasah</malay> [lah] like I think primary two but she was like one year older than us so like is in the same class but she's just one year older then her <malay>abang</malay> also inside and her <malay>abang</malay> is like
okay we're like two thousand right she's ninety nine
then like I think her brothers like ninety eight I think but then we are all in the same class so I'm just like so confused like like I ask her like why are you older but in my class then she say [oh] cause like
my parents register late now I didn't know <malay>madrasah</malay> like if you register late they will put you in primary one so like you can be old and be like in primary one also
then
then I knew
I also don't know [sia] but like that <malay>madrasah</malay> doesn't exist anymore so like
I don't know
it was like long long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years
but we were in the same class
ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
<malay>naik</malay>
this is at the you know <malay>masjid</malay> #Ghufran#
the in #Tampines#
it's in #Tampines# the <malay>masjid</malay> in #Tampines#
ya then after that
then my mom found out like
[oh] (um) this girl her name is #Aisyah#</P2> #Aisyah#</P2>
#Aisyah#</P2>'s mum is actually
my mum's friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like
friends
ya so like me and #Aisyah#</P2> we like
grow up together [lah] like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so I was like primary two primary three
[eh] ya ya something like that
ya
ya but they weren't like very close so it's like I think you know [eh] it's like (um)
if me and
[oh] it's like if you and (err)
how to say [ah]
[ah] it's like you and #Sheila#</P2> like
(uh) got kids and then your your kids and #Sheila#</P2>'s kids
like become friends
and then like you become closer to
no no no but they're closer than that
I don't know [sia] okay like I give up explaining but like whatever yeah they're like quite close [lah]
then [ah] like you and the other Eli</P2> your class <malay>punya</malay> Eli</P2>
yeah so
ya ya ya ya ya then after that
[oh] my god I miss her ya okay anyway then after that right
stop laughing then after that
then (um) so like
we grow up together [lah] from like primary school <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that we go to like you know like like (um)
they have like the #macam# kids alive teens alive tweens alive
<malay>kau tak pergi madrasah</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau tak pergi madrasah</malay>
[oh] my god you Andalus child [oh] my god okay so like okay let me explain [ah] like when you go to <malay>madrasah</malay> right like at at a <malay>masjid</malay>
they used to have like <malay>madrasahs</malay>
like
let's say okay let's say you go to a <malay>madrasah</malay> in (um) <malay>masjid</malay> right like <malay>dulu dulu punya</malay> format [kan] is like <malay>madrasah</malay> #macam#
(err) it's like literal school but just <malay>madrasah</malay> like you got exam and then like got report card <malay>semua</malay> then like they band
ya ya okay so basically it's like an Andalus [lah] then then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session [lah] yah so like
I think
I think like
the first few years #Aisyah#</P2> was
(um)
like afternoon session or whatever [lah] that's how I know like that's how I know a lot of people in the in the #Tampines# area who are like malays cause like I go to like this <malay>masjid punya madrasah</malay> and then like
cause you mix class every time [what] so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
(err) the primary school like when I was in primary school right they created this #macam# new syllabus <malay>abeh</malay> like is everything #macam# in english [ah] english [ah] then like #macam# <malay>tak ada</malay> exams everything is for like
(uh) you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand Malay or anything
ya is yeah yeah so cause <malay>dia dia nak</malay> #macam# like
(um) integrated society or whatever so they so they like abolished they abolished the <malay>madrasah</malay> the <malay>madrasah punya</malay> system so there's no more like exam or anything cause we actually had a Chinese girl in our class
and then like she <malay>kesian</malay> [sia] all the textbooks all in Malay <malay>abeh dia tak faham</malay> like she was just like so confused and the only thing she could can understand ya the only thing she can understand is the Arab cause like
the teacher teach in Arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in English and the textbook is in Arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in Malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small #Kahir#</P2> inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows Chinese
<malay>apa kau</malay> okay maybe cause like he learn cause like what then
like <malay>banyak melayu</malay> [kan] but then I don't know [lah]
yeah
you know that time we go to his house for <malay>raya</malay> right then his <malay>nenek</malay> ask #Kahir#</P2> <malay>siapa tu</malay> then after that he just shake shake he just like !huh! he just like shake his (um)
like shoulders then I ask you understand malay [meh] then he said
(err) I don't know [lah] but I just anyhow just give her response then she just [oh] okay then I'm just like how you speak to your grandmother like that then then after that he say [oh] [ah] usually when I go to my grandma's house right she will give me food then I'm just like (um) <malay>sedap sedap sedap</malay>
yeah it's basically ya food related
I don't know I don't even know if he knows <malay>lawa</malay>
but he listens to Malay songs now
<malay>tak faham</malay> [sia] <malay>aku tak aku pun tak faham</malay> bro just don't ask me
okay so so this Camila</P2> girl right okay the chinese girl is named Kayla</P2> then this Camila</P2> girl she
(um)
she did she got transferred out like after primary three she <malay>tahan</malay> from primary one all the way to primary three bro then after primary three right when they introduced the aLIVE thing then she transferred to aLIVE so there's like Kids aLIVE tweens aLIVE teens aLIVE then youth aLIVE so it's like technically like
(um)
kindergarten then primary school then secondary school all the way until like you finished poly or whatever [lah] then
then after we finish our <malay>madrasah</malay>
then me and #Aisyah#</P2> went to
Teens aLIVE
[eh]
is it Teens aLIVE [oh] ya ya ya secondary school is Teens aLIVE ya then we go to Teens aLIVE right together with her brother and then like coincidentally
(err) her mum said [oh] I put her in the Sunday class cause like confirm secondary school Saturday <malay>nak kena balik sekolah punya</malay> so I just put her in Sunday so she can go on Sunday then my mum was like yeah yeah I put her in Sunday also so like we just ended up sticking through like four plus
two
years
six more years of like being in the same class together right then after okay usually after (um) [ah] <malay>madrasah</malay> right we will go upstairs to this like
the the the <malay>masjid</malay> got like three floors you know so we so our classroom is like second floor then we <malay>naik atas</malay> after (um)
<malay>madrasah</malay> then we go for <malay>mengaji</malay> together ya <malay>mengaji</malay> also same class
