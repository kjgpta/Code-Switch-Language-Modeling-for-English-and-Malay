the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no [lah] I watched until the end [lah] [eh] no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
no I think I think she like <malay>macam</malay> because her life
got so <malay>susah</malay> [kan] so she want like
she <malay>tak nak tengok dia punya</malay> husband and new wife <malay>hidup senang</malay>
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya so I think that's what she wanted [lah] so that the husband <malay>hidup susah juga macam tak</malay> fair <malay>kalau</malay>
ya [lah] because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her <malay>tapi</malay> cause that's what she's not getting from the husband [what]
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious [what]
who the <malay>siapa</malay>
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
(mm)
[oh] is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
(mmhmm)
<malay>dia berapa episode</malay> [ah] sixteen [eh]
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
but other than that I think <malay>macam</malay> the korean <malay>punya</malay> broadcasting stations all like their (um)
<malay>apa nama dia</malay>
the what they ask for is system set the standard [ah] the standard ya no the standard [lah] because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes [what]
locked can you please lock the door
[ah] no <malay>sebab</malay> [kan]
like the story line [lah]
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that
no I watched there's a few versions right
I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven [eh]
ya I don't know [ah] that [one] also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
so I hardly ever like really <malay>habis</malay> [kan] any drama
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor
that was good
(mmhmm)
ya the other day right I went to the clinic at #choa chu kang#
I actually for my migraine [lah] cause my <malay>ubat</malay> migraine finish already
but then at the same time because the doctor was very nice so I ask him [lah] like if he deal with
skin condition if it's like <malay>macam</malay> he can [lah]
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then <malay>dia cakap</malay> can [ah] but
he will prescribe topical or oral <malay>punya ubat</malay> like they don't do aesthetic services [ah]
then I say okay I understand then <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> but if you want I can try to give you like
<malay>macam</malay> the first three months I give you this <malay>ubat</malay>
which contains like vitamin A or something [ah] I forgot what he said current sixty plus
because he said is not [ah] because I I I did ask him is my <malay>macam</malay> I feel like my face is so <malay>macam</malay> #rabak# [ah] then <malay>dia cakap</malay>
[oh] (err) it's not like <malay>macam</malay> really a severe case so I can still <malay>macam</malay> prescribe prescribe
<malay>ubat</malay> for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the <malay>kecil-kecil punya biji</malay>
but then the thing is I googled right website they handle (err) severe cases
(mmhmm) cystic acne
ya [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> there's no head on top right
[oh] that [one] I don't know
ya
so they referred her
but how's the payment like [ah] I'm on I'm on tight budget [seh]
like I don't <malay>macam</malay> I don't see myself spending
but they they only accept cash [ah] they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
but yours is not like <malay>macam</malay> yours is just <malay>macam</malay> white heads kind of
you should
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
[ah] you just get from Cosrx <malay>kat</malay> Watsons <malay>ada</malay>
the exfoliator
why
ya
maybe that's because like <malay>macam</malay> depends on the product [lah]
but this [one] also is because
of last weekend
cause I didn't hydrate myself after drinking
is this [one] is cystic acne then after that it exploded but the ones on my forehead it didn't
haven't yet <malay>macam</malay> usually my cystic acne right other than this [lah]
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone <malay>gitu</malay> [jer]
ya [lah]
but I also but it's because of period
but my forehead I really don't know
then
then you want me to get married to fix this
ya because your hormones balance off [what]
like <malay>macam</malay> after you get you've after you give birth like <malay>macam</malay>
all your hormonal shit like happens
then what you want me to just to clear my face you want me to get married and give birth is it
and then <malay>apa bekam</malay> [kan] <malay>muka</malay> <malay>ada</malay> mini cups LOL what the heck
I don't [ah] I'm trying this (err)
the supplement first but after that
what
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] because I
work five days a week I don't wear makeup at all [what]
even even in even on weekends right <malay>macam</malay> rare <malay>gila</malay>
but I haven't buy I haven't had a chance to go Watsons
but I I wanted to get like a standard circle plaster
like you know the they sell the circle ones right but I haven't had a chance to go but I want I wanted to cut
you know the normal standard plaster I wanted to cut
but it's in the middle of my face then like stupid right
should I try I'll try later
I think #aini# <malay>macam semua turun-menurun</malay> because <malay>ayah dulu pun ada pe macam gini</malay>
you see <malay>ayah</malay> face [lah] or all the <malay>macam wak mak long</malay> also have like
like the <malay>bekas-bekas</malay>
pimple I hope my kids don't get it
I regret one thing I regret right <malay>macam</malay> in my life
one small thing that I regret is putting on makeup too young
I I mean that even if even though it's poly time right I think I was
the very first time I like literally used
(err) foundation is time
my poly first year seventeen when I <malay>gatal-gatal</malay> you know <malay>bila</malay>
ya [lah] then because you remember you gave me the Kat Von D foundation <malay>dulu</malay>
you use the <malay>macam</malay> the high the heavy duty <malay>punya</malay> Kat Von D <malay>dulu</malay> then
ya then you it didn't work for you [what] so you give me then that was my very first foundation ever in my life
ya it's too thick it's so dirty
no [lah] I'm just saying then I didn't know [what] <malay>macam</malay> I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation [what] so I just use that every time so <malay>macam</malay> I think that
foundation like required me to use like double cleansing or what but I didn't [what]
I don't think I even had a makeup remover I just washed my face with face wash I think that point of time
but it's so it's not accessible <malay>nak beli</malay>
it's only online [what]
no I never use all I stopped already
that [one] I don't I want to either give my friend or I throw
ya
texture [lah]
no I feel like my skin is worse when I constantly use makeup
I feel like my skin is worse when I constantly use makeup
ya so <malay>kirakan macam</malay>
<malay>kalau pakai</malay> makeup <malay>lebih</malay>
<malay>muka muka lagi</malay> #rabak# even though like <malay>macam</malay> I do the proper cleansing [ah]
ya because like <malay>macam</malay> I don't put anything on my face [what] and I do <malay>macam</malay> regular
<malay>punya</malay> skincare
