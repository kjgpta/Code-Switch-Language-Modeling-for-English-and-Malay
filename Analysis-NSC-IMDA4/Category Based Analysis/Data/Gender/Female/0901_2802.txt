(err) finish my practicum !yay! (um) I think <malay>semalam</malay>
technically
I complete four hundred hours [lah] around wednesday but I stretch over
cause I <malay>macam</malay> like you know
I took half day half day
[ah]
ya !alamak!
(mm) two and a half months around there
ya ya I just need to complete four hundred hours
true true then <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
like was just getting into like the hang of it then after that like
#kobe#
I don't know
(uh) it's not project (um) it's just basically more case management
(uh) so <malay>macam</malay>
in a way <malay>macam</malay> same thing as (um)
what I did [lah] for my previous job
(uh) so <malay>macam</malay> meet client then (um) got assessment then <malay>lepas itu</malay>
we do [lah] same around the same [lah] it's more intense cause
(err) it's residential areas so it residential not institution [lah]
then <malay>macam apa itu</malay> my office is literally <malay>macam</malay> just beside the units where they live so <malay>macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa</malay> then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven [lah]
[ah]
I don't know if I want to say
okay [lah]
I don't know
ya [lah] okay [lah] existing cases <malay>tapi macam apa itu</malay>
because <malay>sekarang macam buat</malay> split teams [kan] then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle <malay>macam cuma</malay> two units each [lah] so <malay>kita punya</malay> outside unfortunately <malay>macam banyak</malay>
(err) like we face shortage of manpower [lah] <malay>macam</malay> cause (um) this the (err)
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs [lah] <malay>macam</malay> two services so <malay>dia kesian gila</malay> [lah] like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time <malay>bila</malay> phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
the (um) from the office my my office there [lah] so
so (uh) so then <malay>macam</malay> then she also has to handle the clients [kan] the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she (err) she also has to attend to the matters there [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> double work
[ah] so she <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
[ah]
then <malay>baru sahaja</malay> recently another staff left ya cause
it's not <malay>pasal itu</malay> [lah] like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out I think corporate world so leave it be [lah]
ya
I think so
I think so not too sure
okay [lah]
but ya
but I don't know [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay>
(err) yesterday I meet up with the (um) [lah] then <malay>dia tanya</malay> I like <malay>kalau</malay> do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added [lah] if I want to come to the company and work then <malay>macam</malay> I don't know what program [lah] <malay>ada satu program ini</malay> dia !hey! just started up their office is in #simei# which is like great [lah] <malay>macam</malay> very near my house
finally somewhere I go is near my house
I realised my <malay>tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila</malay> ya
like at least at least [ah] fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
(um) not
full time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (err) how to say [ah] they ask me to apply <malay>tapi macam</malay> a bit weird [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I was telling one of the colleague <malay>macam</malay> the colleague there [lah] the staff there there was like
I apply right then I turn up at the interview
then (uh) what <malay>macam</malay> (um) so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the (uh) my my (um) the staff there <malay>cakap</malay> (uh) the is the one you are interview [lah]
then <malay>macam</malay> like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor [lah] then then she on the first day I came in for my <malay>macam</malay> meet up session <malay>dengan dia</malay> and my reporting officer
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
<malay>sampai padahal</malay> they just want to get to know me better [lah]
so cute [ah] then she ask me [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you can go this option this option then <malay>apa itu</malay>
(um) then she ask me if I want to continue working [lah] at the same place <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> internship <malay>itu</malay> then I <malay>macam</malay> (err) not sure [lah] like a bit too far [lah] but
I guess it makes sense [lah] for me to <malay>macam</malay> continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then <malay>macam</malay> in terms of <malay>macam</malay> you know blend in with the team <malay>gitu</malay> like they know it's going to work
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya ya no issues [lah] ya I think
I think internally <malay>adalah macam</malay> issue <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] cause <malay>dia dah macam</malay> cause <malay>ada</malay> change [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> the difference in (mm) <malay>apa</malay> power dynamics I guess much <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be <malay>macam</malay> less
(err) hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program [kan] so <malay>macam dia</malay> (um) just suppose head of the homes is actually <malay>macam</malay> a bit restricted [lah]
!haiya! he's like he's the one <malay>yang</malay> actually main person to do the homes and everything but because (um) the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia dah lama dengan kita</malay> [lah] she already do this kind of this job so <malay>macam</malay> when she comes in and station [kan] the office <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] so (err) I think he feels a bit restricted [lah]
ya ya can tell <malay>sikit</malay> [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>dia macam</malay> like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then <malay>macam</malay> cause he got his own way of doing things then <malay>macam</malay> like he doesn't think that we should do this but (err) in a way
I would say that she overrides him
(uh) then <malay>macam</malay> like ya then <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day <malay>macam</malay> like I <malay>dengar</malay> two things [ah] like I think <malay>dia pun macam segan</malay> and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I <malay>macam</malay> (uh) then <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day <malay>dia cakap</malay> [lah] like I'm not trying to supervise you
but (um) this is how it's going to work [lah] this is how I we used to do it [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> caught in [tau]
ya ya I know
so like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> am I talking too much
ya <malay>macam</malay> like this client he came back from hospital then <malay>dia pakai</malay> taxi then he kept asking [lah]
<malay>lepas itu</malay> (err) I want to
(err) be refunded by for my cab then <malay>apa itu dia cakap</malay>
(err) [oh] last time
(err) the assistant director did this (err) blah blah blah and then she always say if I need help can come and ask [ah] then
<malay>apa itu</malay> I put in a group chat [lah] where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
(um) ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in [lah]
so then after I (uh) I got the message then the head of the homes came and then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I <malay>macam</malay> like what what is going on
ya
ya and then <malay>macam</malay> like it felt weird like <malay>macam apa</malay>
like <malay>dia orang punya</malay> procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
then I was like but the chat I thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
ya so like <malay>macam</malay> I felt a bit (err) and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
I guess <malay>macam dia orang</malay> treat me a bit like staff there [lah] which I understand [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think <malay>bila</malay> yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they they allow me to do a lot of things
I guess so good and bad [lah]
I I felt like <malay>macam</malay> still <malay>terikat</malay> [lah] like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> check in <malay>sangat</malay> [lah] like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so <malay>macam</malay> like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so <malay>macam</malay> in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client <malay>tidak ada</malay>
like what is it there's no bad impact [lah] on the client at the end of the day [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> two and a half months actually quite short [lah]
like ya but
but at different locations [ah] under different program
(mm) (mm)
I think
<malay>ada</malay> one <malay>satu</malay> grad dip then the other is I think (um) under grad but (err) it's her second practicum
(uh) so I think this company <malay>macam</malay> purposely they take up (err)
they tried to pick up <malay>macam</malay> grad dip <malay>yang pernah kerja</malay>
in the social service ya
ya ya in the social service sector so that <malay>macam</malay> (mm) not train [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you know (uh)
work etiquette [ah] work etiquette <malay>macam</malay> like organisation after awhile <malay>macam</malay> a lot of organization <malay>macam</malay> structured a certain way
and then <malay>macam</malay> there's like cause I know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like there's policy there's guidelines <malay>macam</malay> there's to meet <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> like I roughly know [lah]
[ah] then it's also under so previously my previous job (um) they are the funders ya
so (err)
ya so I kind of know [lah] <malay>punya</malay> mentality where they go they a bit
how to say
they are a bit <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>jaga muka jaga</malay> face <malay>sikit</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> they expect
(err) fast and (err) presentable results
I guess like <malay>macam</malay> when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast [kan] ya so <malay>macam</malay> some of them <malay>macam</malay> resistant some of them <malay>macam</malay> they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or <malay>macam</malay> the society or the community <malay>macam</malay> thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report [lah] to government or which is [lah] can trickle down to usually [lah] cause they always report to [lah]
that's your
so then anything raise up [lah] then blah blah blah <malay>nanti</malay> in the end <malay>turun</malay> to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so <malay>macam</malay> be miracle [lah] miracle workers then <malay>kita cakap dengan dia orang</malay> [lah] it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time <malay>dia orang pun tak nak</malay> someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
it's considered private affairs [what] (uh)
so in the end you have to get consent from them
and then <malay>macam</malay> how to say
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> is a bit <malay>merepek</malay> [lah] at times I feel
they cannot
cannot be that <malay>macam</malay> one case worker has to hold maybe around
(err) I think last time <malay>apa</malay> [eh] eighty cases
then
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer [lah] they wanted I think hundred I was like <malay>kalau</malay> hundred one case <malay>sahaja</malay> can be like <malay>besar gila</malay> because of their complications is are they
ya and then ya that's why
someone who is very minimal <malay>macam susah gila</malay> it's because like it comes and goes [ah] each person <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> this period they are okay some periods not and then also <malay>macam</malay> seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like <malay>macam</malay> chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>macam</malay>
how to say <malay>macam</malay> it ties into their
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
so <malay>dia teringat-ingat</malay> the families [ah] or what how is your relationship with their family [lah] that kind of thing
ya
ya correct correct
ya
you <malay>ketawa</malay>
for like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> reporting period [lah] ya then <malay>macam</malay>
supposed to
supposed to ya
(uh) no no
(um) you have to record down [ah]
but I think <malay>macam</malay> they try to push [lah] <malay>macam</malay> reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that <malay>macam</malay> is singular case work [lah] it must <malay>macam kita buat</malay> group work or something considered under the [lah] because <malay>macam</malay>
it's try [lah] they try to [lah] maximum I think thirty to forty [lah] but then nowadays [ah] cases <malay>macam</malay> complicated you the person itself is not alone [kan] then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah</malay>
and I was like
and <malay>apa</malay>
I don't know I I think I'm not suited for at all
I might [lah] I I will I will look through the #simei# [one] is a new program it it seems like <malay>macam</malay> (um) a a duplication of some of their services so <malay>macam</malay> like
I ask them [ah] what is it about this new program that you want to start (uh) new siting cause <malay>macam</malay> I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs [lah]
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then [ah]
so then I ya so then I was like asking so what's the difference [lah] because last time like this kind of services still the same and
I mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
(uh) people I think can't remember where
(err) I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred [lah] so then what's the <malay>macam</malay> main difference [lah] between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very (um) <malay>macam apa</malay> exploratory
[ah] so I don't know [lah] what's going on
[oh] no no there's no need to <malay>itu</malay> I have to I apply the usual route [lah]
(uh) ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty [lah]
ya cause I just
<malay>macam</malay> I'm not in the headspace to <malay>cari kerja sekarang</malay>
(uh) like
I just like finished my practicum I just like submitted my last assignment
ya
and then in two weeks time I have like exams which I like I haven't even started studying
ya ya
no no no no it's okay it's okay (uh)
my line is very small I don't know if it's clear or not but I'm holding the the the the mic ya near to my mouth but sometimes I move [lah]
so cute
so maybe when I take a break from studying [lah] I start applying for a jobs
that's so sad
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters <malay>ke tak</malay> next year is like I I feel <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
it's not that [lah] I <malay>macam</malay> don't know where to go yet I don't know if <malay>macam</malay> is the place for me to do masters like <malay>macam</malay> after one year one point five years of doing grad dip [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like
is it a good place to start like to study [lah] <malay>macam</malay> their profs are good and everything but <malay>macam ada</malay> I don't know [lah] what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work

<malay>apa itu</malay> using recording <malay>ke apa</malay> right ya it sounds weird net factor
(mm) (mm)

but nowadays is like <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay>
one person stay at home like you still need that double income somehow
ya
I know which is like <malay>macam</malay> a bit worrying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think I <malay>tengah fikir-fikir</malay> because <malay>macam</malay>
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility [kan] but then also
is (uh)
like you shouldn't <malay>segan</malay> and not ask for help and then my (mm) then my parents <malay>dia orang tak nak macam</malay> they want to have their own lives [lah] they don't want to be like you know
babysitters so
it's like the only other options I can see is that I <malay>macam berhenti kerja sekejap</malay> [lah] <malay>jaga anak</malay> and then ya and then potentially you lose
(uh) <malay>apa itu</malay> credibility (um) relevancy to the the area that you are in then <malay>susah balik nak masuk kerja</malay>
ya so
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband [ah] and then <malay>macam</malay> a lot of people tell me [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] what (uh) don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent <malay>macam</malay> like what is going on
ya
ya
ya
I know
four months four months
(mm)
(mm)
ya but at the end of the day <malay>macam</malay> but if you is good [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you only want to have like one kid <malay>sahaja</malay> but then <malay>kalau</malay> you want <malay>anak kedua ketiga</malay> then when is it going to stop
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
technically <malay>kalau nak masuk</malay> playgroup [lah] it's a nice timing to <malay>masuk balik kerja</malay> and then
you send the kid to play group [lah] then even then even then it's not full time you but not sure [lah] ya so do you want to work part time and then
I don't know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> culture not flexible yet
I think ya
so <malay>macam</malay>
