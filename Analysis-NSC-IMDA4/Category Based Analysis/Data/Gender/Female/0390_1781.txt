okay can
!hey! you aunty
I'm doing okay
I got here like thirty minutes [lah] cause you know [ah] the train [ah] super late [ah] I really hate it you know the aunty <malay>mak cik</malay> all very irritating
<malay>tak merah tak merah</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>kau gila punya jauh aku kalau boleh nak naik</malay> Grab but I didn't take Grab either no [lah] I very very everything I just take train or Grab but that time Grab is expensive [ah] so cannot [lah] okay I no more money already
[eh] you text me just now you say <malay>kau cakap kau ada mimpi</malay> [eh]
you you then the pain all you can feel it
you were alone in the hospital
sister are you a single mother
alright it doesn't matter [lah] the what mattered is the baby is there ya if the baby so what happened
!walao! [eh] <malay>sakit</malay> [sia]
[oh] really [ah] so you only dream like just the you giving birth process only [lah]
[oh] so you didn't but then you say the next day you got dream some more
[oh] got saga just <malay>sambung</malay> [ah] !walao! [eh] then the then the second dream whose inside the dream
then the baby like what how she look like is she naughty <malay>dia baik ke dia macam</malay>
!aww!
could you feel like the maternity love already
[ah] like a responsibility [ah]
then when you wake up from it like what do you feel
ya [lor] so <malay>macam</malay> like got the happy ending [lah]
so so now you want to have a baby in your life
ya but so many signs [eh] already like before <malay>sebelum ni pun macam</malay> like <malay>kau dah ada mimpi-mimpi</malay> right like all this type of dreams
I don't know I feel like it's very weird cause I don't get this kind of a dream but like somehow you get this kind of dream is like I feel like it's a sign but I also don't know [lah] what is a sign
[ah] ya ya
whether you are responsible enough like yet [lah]
okay cool sis so anyway (um)
you know [ah] later I'm going to go (err) have a job interview
then this job interview I'm having [ah] is asking me [ah] all type of weird questions [one]
so okay my intention is that [ah] <malay>aku nak cakap dengan engkau dulu</malay> the dream then after that both of us can like (um)
come with our own answers so that later at the interview I will know how to answer the person [lah] better
okay so the one of the questions the like interviewer asking is (um)
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would be inside
ya [lor]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh]
(err) but then your diary would it be like rage or like would it be like reflecting
but like ten years ago how how <malay>umur kau berapa</malay> ten years ago
[ah] so okay imagine yourself at eighteen
raging
eighteen <malay>siapa kau dengan siapa</malay> [ah] <malay>masih dengan</malay> #azee#
<malay>ya ke</malay>
ya ya ya
ya I remember you telling me about your friends they're like quite toxic right
what would the okay then if there's a time capsule from ten years ago [ah] what what would you probably be saying to yourself
[oh] [ah]
which you are kind of okay okay or not not at all
ya ya so long ago also
me [ah] I think [ah] ten years ago I was sixteen right
so <malay>enam belas tahun kau tahu</malay> [lah] [kan] sec four [eh] [ah] sec four <malay>pun nak cakap apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dengan diri aku</malay>
[oh]
<malay>dah</malay> happening [ah] actually <malay>dok aku</malay> sec four <malay>pasal aku dah jumpa</malay> julie <malay>semua apa</malay>
ya I was already outside mixing with the outside people so probably ya and I think
I don't think I was also depressed or lost or anything I was just very like exploring life at that point of time because
ya like from julie I met so many people and then also I met #hakim# or #risahd# which is nothing to do with julie meeting him at sixteen was a blessing [sia] like if I didn't meet him right
<malay>aku rasa macam aku</malay> wild cause (uh) I met him towards the end of my sixteen so means <malay>aku dah habis</malay> A-levels [ah]
so then [ah] #hakim# and I we started meeting and then he taught me how to longboard then we went to gigs but it's like going out with him is very decent like you know <malay>macam</malay> not say <malay>abang</malay> [lah] but he's
activities are very [lah] so it's very good as compared to like if let's say I was mixing with the same kids still it's not really good right because like they drink and everything
and then like I might have boyfriends but with #hakim# also we were just friends so it was really good and then he will bring #ahmad# along so we go gig we go (um)
longboard I even worked with him at his Sakura part time until the following year (uh) seventeen years old I I <malay>masuk</malay>
so I think if I were sixteen probably what I would say to myself and I broke up wait I haven't met #amin# yet so
probably I will say to my sixteen year old self like
hello girl girl [ah]
[eh] you how are you still you still got boyfriend or you no boyfriend I hope whoever your boyfriend is you happy [lah] okay
(uh) and I hope that you're still friends with #hakim# which I still am <malay>alhamdulillah</malay>
(err) are you still longboarding (err) probably all that [lah] probably asking how is she doing in life like me now
and if I think most probably my sixteen year old would just want to know whether I'm happy like ya even then I think happiness was just my aim it didn't it didn't matter like
what I was doing in life ya it just mattered like I was peaceful and was happy that's all
so ya if I will say to if I read that then I will probably tell her or him like
I doing good yo I'm doing super good
ya I got this shit [ah] I mean it took me some time but twenty six is the year yo twenty twenty I got my shit together
okay okay so
the other question they will ask me [ha] is the
(um)
!walao! [eh] got so many questions you know they ask
[oh] ya ya ya what is the pettiest reason you would dislike someone
okay
but that's so like normal though
okay [lah] okay [lah] ya ya but it's also very human nature I feel
ya very petty
our english always <malay>berterabur</malay> sis
what what other things would you be petty about
[oh]
[a'ah] [ah]
but does this apply only to like your is it friends or contacts guys or like what or people in general
guys [ah] right ya
cause if girls like you know it's nothing personal right it's like you
ya ya ya
but with guys it's a bit more like deeper also it's like rude hello you're a man okay I give you my time
[oh] ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>tapi memang</malay> irritating [ah] [kan]
ya ya she's just making your life difficult
(uh huh) (uh huh)
<malay>umur dia berapa macam</malay> [oh]
is she like really obvious that she didn't see you or <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>buat buat tak nampak</malay>
!walao! [eh] why she like that [one]
like how dare you block my way you want to fight is it !huh! you want to fight
me [ah] pettiest reason [ah]
[ah] [seh] so no I'm like okay I like definitely if you ask me now I don't think there's anything that can make me dislike a person but if I try to backward backward like <malay>zaman</malay> I more impulsive and reckless
(err) pettiest for reason for me to [oh] my god
even if I dislike someone I don't think the reason would be petty like you know me like the reason has to be so strong for me to like not like the person
okay [lah] petty reasons like just not say hate but it's just like !aiya! like dislike a bit [ah] [ah] it's like our dearest [lor]
[ah] like like she never do anything like outright to like harm us but
like it I guess the pettiness is coming from like the way she talks like the way she talk like it's it comes off as like
<malay>macam kita cakap macam</malay> condescending like like <malay>kita ni macam bodoh</malay> like that then ya [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> okay [oh] [oh] okay this [one] is the pettiest reason
if [ah] like at work there's this engineer he's not the same department as us
so [ah] sometimes I will fall asleep so who's fault is that it's my fault right not supposed to fall asleep but [ah]
because he <malay>tegur</malay> [ah] so it make me not like him so it's a petty reason [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] it's like okay but then again because the way they <malay>tegur</malay> [ah] it's like really <malay>kurang ajar</malay> also
ya that's true okay but then again it is [lah] correct [lah] it's our fault we shouldn't sleep at work I know that like it is a like common sense thing
but there is ways for you to like <malay>kejutkan orang</malay> you know this engineer [ah] will really scream at your face yell at your face [one] [leh] like like no <malay>cara tak ada cara aku aku macam nak sepak muka dia</malay> but then
<malay>masa kat kerja</malay> right <malay>tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> so okay [lah] just <malay>terima seadanya</malay> [jer] [lah]
but ya but then ya [lah] it becomes petty because [ah] whenever I see him now I don't like him only because everytime I fall asleep at work
I will get traumatised and think of him [ah] like [ah] no no no later that guy will come and scream at me
ya
what other reason could we be petty about like not liking someone like it's not like hate like not hate [lah] right just like annoyed
can
[oh] is it like what
[oh] ya ya ya ya I think me too also I think everyone [lah] right
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] [ah] [oh] [oh] [oh]
[oh] ya I think <malay>kau pernah bilang dengan aku ini</malay>
she's so weird because <malay>pasal kau dengan dia macam tak ada kena mengena gitu</malay>
[oh] because you were julie
[oh] cause so she thought that whole thing was messed up [lah]
ya because she didn't know like the true story and everything
ya ya correct correct that's judging it off
ya ya ya [oh] you mean she said hi to everyone except you
[oh] I think she's one of those girls that's like if I don't like you I'm not going to fake it like ya that's it [lor]
ya [lah] ya [lah] for me like I think the pettiest not pettiest [lah] this [one] is not so petty I don't know whether it's petty or it's (um)
okay petty reasons people might not like me in the past [ah] right it's just like
like some people like make up story about me last time like the name the nickname don't want to say here
then another person will just take that nickname and be like [oh] is it okay [lah] then I also don't like her now even though they don't even know me know then like
like and then like my friend happens to be that conversation so she she told me then <malay>di belakang aku padahalnya macam</malay>
she's like <malay>kau tahu yang ni tak suka kau</malay> then <malay>aku macam apasal</malay>
what I do [sia] I don't know I just come [sia] so it's like
and then it's just because of the nickname I had last time which was wrongly like portrayed by someone else
so I thought that was very petty I think another reason why (err) [ah] like I got it was also a petty reason why like a girl didn't like me last time in class [ah] was because
the guy that she liked in class like me and then after that (err) her guy best friend also like me then then she don't like me but then you know what's the worst part is that she is like
best friends with me in class [one] not
ya ya like and then like
she then like I was really shocked [lah] cause <malay>aku</malay> really like <malay>pandang dia macam</malay> sister [ah] but then like
ya then eventually I found out that [eh] you know [ah] she she say [ah] like she got say to me before
why why all these guys like me [lah] [ah] she said her tits not even that big my tits are bigger
and then I'm like when I heard that I was like <malay>kesian</malay> or what like you think your tits are the selling point [ah] bro
that is just shows that I have small tits and guys still like don't you think it's something to do character rather than your (err) physics ya exactly
ya and it's like very <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] like [eh] <malay>aku</malay> oval <malay>tak tahu merah ke tak</malay> [sial] <malay>bising</malay> [sial] <malay>aku</malay> oval [ha] !walao! [eh]
okay so far it's okay
[eh] but then [ah] she took the worst vengeance on me possible you know
one year later she entered the same as my boyfriend at that point of time I didn't know that they were the same then they went overseas for the to #bangkok# I think
then my boyfriend came back right then he confessed to me he sort of cheated on me he touched this girl he touched this girl then
he touched this so he touched this girl then after that he tell me he touched this girl because (um) she said that she's a lesbian so he touched her boob to like prove her that she's not
then I ask [lah] who is this girl then he told me then I know that girl [what] she's my ex-classmate then I then I then <malay>aku</malay> naive [ah] <malay>habis aku cakap dengan dia</malay> [ah] like
you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know [lah] she's my classmate then lulu like always go around with like the different key went like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she like which I didn't even like you know or you care about I didn't work with them like they were just friends but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend [ah] like you
like you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know [lah] she's my classmate <malay>dia dulu</malay> like always
go around with like the different he even like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she liked which I didn't even like know or even care about I didn't go out with them like they were just friends
but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend [lah] like you
stupid [sia] you just so stupid like you're so stupid like <malay>perangai jantan kebrek punya macam</malay> like [oh] you are les let me turn you straight like you don't try to be some hero and in fact she's the one who manipulated you
especially because she knows you are my boyfriend
!wah! I like never felt even more betrayed at that point of time
so ya [lah] but I never confronted after her her after that but if I everytime I saw her at school I will just like <malay>jeling</malay> her so hard and like actually (uh) like I'm not the type to
hate on girls or are like <malay>macam</malay> be enemies with them but !wow! what she did was something so nasty and like even if she never did it to me right let's say she did the whole thing to another person I would still feel so turned off
that such a person exist that can be so
I know [lah] like okay your self esteem probably like <malay>jatuh</malay> because you know all the guys like went to me like I don't blame you for that but for you to take vengeance that way is so dirty and nasty [sia]
so ya [lah] but like afterwards I don't feel anything for her [lah] I feel more sorry for her that she had to go to that length to get man's attention
ya like going to that length of like ya I've never been touched by a boy before like girl I know you did you know something with my ex-classmate
ya babe <malay>kau tak payah cakap</malay> babe ex <malay>aku dia nombor satu</malay> babe <malay>dia kalau buat benda dia fikir pakai konek</malay> [jer] <malay>dulu sebelum apa-apa</malay> babe
<malay>bodoh</malay> [sia]
that was an interesting time like like if I see her now like I won't be I won't hate her [lah] but it's more of like a bit disgusted
what she did back then but ya also like like just hope that she's changed now [lah] it's just more of like
I think it's just more to me it comes off to me like !wah! <malay>aku tak tahu ada manusia macam gini macam</malay> that can do that to someone else not that I was so hurt by it but I'm just like so
mind blown by it like !walao! [eh] like I could never [sia] go through that trouble for man ya [lor]
so ya petty things [ah] !huh! that people so it's not really I petty with people people was petty with me [one] but it's okay this is life I already got used to it
now they petty with me I'm unbothered [one]
alright okay this [one] is if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
<malay>apa</malay> babe
(mmhmm)
[oh] (mm) (mm)
ya that's so awesome <malay>nanti kalau kau pergi</malay> travel settle [sia]
[oh] ya and like <malay>baca quran</malay> and also <malay>kau faham</malay>
ya ya
[oh] my god that's so cool but you can already play no cannot [eh]
[a'ah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
(err) can play a lot of things [siol] can play the piano keyboard ya still got one more
it could be anything in the world like even if you're not going to use it as often but it's just like (uh) so it's just a random skill like [oh] you so you can do that then you're like ya [lor] I can
[oh] that's great [sia] like you don't need to call people for shit anymore
and save money also
I'm not surprised that you want that because <malay>aku macam pernah nampak kau</malay> like one like being handy like remember that that that thing <malay>jatuh kat</malay> toilet
and then I'm like die [lah] ending and then you're like no I can do it then I'm like [oh] she got the spirit
I love how mine got the random red like when I'm very excited
!walao! [eh] confirm can [one] [lah] it's just one line don't be petty [lah] we're just talked about being petty okay so
ya okay for me right
obviously the first skill I will take is cooking [ah]
like [ah] but it's not because I will learn cooking eventually but it will be like beginner level so if I could take one skill that's immediate like chef level <malay>mak aku punya</malay> level I will take cooking
then it's not just convenient for myself but it's convenient for like my loved one like if I want to cook for my friends my family so I think it's a very useful [ah] skill
second skill (um)
so random [ah] but I would pick up sea sea diving [eh]
(mm) so fun [sia]
like in general I've (uh) I've always been intrigued by the sea
<malay>aku tahu berenang</malay> [ah] but I <malay>pun tak pernah masuk dalam</malay> [ah] <malay>berenang aku tahu pasal kat</malay> secondary school <malay>kita belajar</malay>
[eh] float <malay>dah</malay> okay [sia] some people don't even know how to float which I teach them also [ah] sometimes
but ya I would learn how to sea dive actually it's a very [ah] actually cooking and sea diving I feel is very doable [lah] can so ya but if I could choose it right now <malay>aku terus tahu</malay> it's sea diving [ah]
like that's why when #shai# like her videos ya #tioman# I always feel like !wah! best [sia] [ah] like I want to
but even before I know that she was inside I already had friends who already went inside so I've already gotten like that kind of aspiration where [oh] it's very doable you just go #tioman#
<malay>kau bayar setakat berapa</malay> hundred dollars then <malay>kau dapat</malay> can do sea diving <malay>cuma kat</malay> singapore nothing to sea dive [ah] so you have to overseas [ah]
ya but so far [eh] you know can touch the okay okay cannot touch the coral but you can see [kan] everything so so first is the cooking so I can be master chef for my family and friends then second is sea dive so that I can be relaxed in the water
so third skill if I could pick up okay [ah] <malay>kalau nak cakap nyanyi nyanyi</malay> is more of like a natural born [lah] so <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] [kan]
if I could pick up
can <malay>ke</malay> [oh] <malay>kena</malay> vocal coaching
ya [ah] like okay some people <malay>macam</malay> like born with it like <malay>dah bagus</malay> but ya there's many cases <malay>dia orang macam</malay> vocal coaching right
ya ya
[a'ah] [a'ah] ya
correct
right is the vocal coach <malay>yang kau tengok kat</malay> YouTube tristan is it
[ah] I always watch tristan correct and then his recent videos james charles <malay>nyanyi dia sedap</malay> [sia] ya it's nice
so it can be done you just have to learn
alright [sia] then like that you do not have to have talent you just have to have correct and then eventually that can be talent also
hard work correct and that eventually that can be talent also
that's even like more hard work talent [seh] because you were not born with it you worked for
okay like that I will take the singing [lah]
but then I won't be singer [lah] like I won't have that much free time
I'll just be me and my friends like guys I can sing out some karaoke ya [lor]
okay good to know I feel like I'm getting to know you better as a person through these questions [ah]
ya [lor] ya [lor]
how do you think (oo)
[ah]
(hmm)
<malay>rabak</malay> [sial] babe
suddenly <malay>aku</malay> suddenly <malay>aku punya</malay> spike up <malay>banyak apasal</malay>
light effect
alright (um) !wah! if you get a chance to wake up as an actor okay I need to prompt if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day
which actor would you become and why
ya [lor]
<malay>kau</malay> can think out of the box <malay>kau boleh ambil orang</malay> (err) <malay>orang</malay> korea <malay>orang jepun orang</malay> malaysia <malay>orang</malay> indonesia it's up to <malay>kau</malay> [lor]
I know right
okay this [one] is the actor is the very everybody will know [one]
(oo)
correct correct even though his true personality is so reserved and mysterious but he can in his
he really manages to (err) exercise different parts of his like personality through like movies
ya [lah] ya [lah] you skip that part [lah]
no you you now if you wake up as him now he's already over the mishap people the whole world know him already so the
so you must say this so you must explain
(mm) where is it okay which actor one day which actor you want to become and why
!alamak! you kills
(oo)
so you wake up you look at the <malay>cermin</malay> and then you'll be like [oh] be that man be like ya [sia] then eyebrows I've dark eyebrows
but you know <malay>kau tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia kena bahan rabak</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>rabak</malay>
<malay>rabak gila</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> actually from season <malay>tak dia tak kena bahang</malay> umbrella academy umbrella academy does a great job ya <malay>kat luar</malay> because
okay his singing career and also I think he made maybe a few #booboos# but then again [kan] he's young
<malay>kau faham tak</malay> he's young like no [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like #booboos# like (err) <malay>macam</malay> on Instagram live <malay>macam macam macam</malay> acting weird acting <malay>macam</malay> socially awkward
ya like we at that age also we said a lot of stupid things we are cringey
but I guess the ones who's making fun of him are also about that age [ah] <malay>macam</malay> thirteen [sia] so ya but then it's a lot of them so they really <malay>bahang</malay> [kan] him [lah] ya
but then I'm like you all shut up [lah] you all young
but you know goodness <malay>kau tu belum lagi nampak</malay>
<malay>ada satu</malay> video <malay>dia nyanyi kat</malay> Instagram live <malay>memang kelakar</malay> [ah] <malay>dia macam nyanyi yang yang</malay> love <malay>yang</malay> love love <malay>tu</malay> but that is not so <malay>rabak</malay> also
ya it's not enough to ruin what he has already done so far at umbrella academy [sia]
ya and makes him human ya
he's still eighteen
ya
going to paint history
correct cause we're like dude [oh] wait <malay>kita lagi rabak daripada dia</malay> [kan] okay we couldn't even act back then
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] (uh) correct but then I think after season two [ah] umbrella academy [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> this season <malay>dia orang lagi banyak</malay> scenes [kan] and like <malay>boleh cakap</malay> he <malay>bawa</malay> the whole show on his back
so it's like even though like the <malay>bahang</malay> still exist but (uh) I think a lot of people are giving him acknowledgement and credit that he deserve [ah] for season two
he is even more powerful [sia] season two
ya
<malay>padahal dia orang tunjuk pun macam</malay> the videos of him being socially awkward with his fans online <malay>pun macam pada aku</malay> like normal [seh] like it's just like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> okay he has a sort of personality [lah] which is a bit quirky but if we see it as quirky then you will understand why his awkward not as
he's so weird he's creepy like okay you all you all not cultured guys ya okay so for me if I had to choose one actor to wake up as
I would definitely choose joseph gordon levitt
people will know him as tom (err) from the five hundred days of summer
it's because why is because I think he is honestly such a brilliant person like
he is doing his own like company for the past several years where
he's so amazing [lah] like he gives platform for like like independent like artists all over the world to showcase their work from like
it can be anything from audio (err) to like <malay>macam</malay> you doing cartoon and then he will showcase it and bring it forward to the world you know
so he doesn't use like existing like people who is already rich no he wants to give everyone a shot and like ya it's called hits record
like ya that's why (uh) recently if you saw <malay>dia macam</malay> post something like !hey! someone in malaysia can you guys (um)
(err) say a a poem a <malay>puisi</malay> in malay (err) so that <malay>aku</malay> like so that <malay>dia boleh</malay>
he was sharing [ah] and then everybody will send their entry [ah] so he really picks up tendon from anything and anywhere and I find that so inspiring and in fact I think he's been sprang to me even since that friendship just assemble I like how work he has been from the start you life
[ah] he will share it [ah] and then everybody will send their entry [ah] so
he really picks up talent from anything and anywhere and I find it so inspiring
and in fact I think he's been inspiring to me even since that five hundred days of summer I like how vogue he has been from the start of time
like even about his character like everything about him right to me is the equivalent of the most unproblematic
man on earth and I know he's married [lah] but he even then he's so low key about his marriage and
wife <malay>dia</malay> is a like a like a brilliant also like she's some [ah] president for like an kind of company so
you can tell he's not just also married like a woman just because she's hot but he's married her for her intellect and kindness and everything
so I would love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does and everything
so I'd love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does for (err) everyday
okay [eh] no but then I would also choose johnny depp but if I were to choose johnny depp it will be more for his
personal life cause I was a fan I was a very huge fan of johnny depp when I was in my teenage years all so <malay>aku</malay>
I learnt about johnny depp's (err) wife not wife [ah] they never married [ah] vanessa #paradis# I fucking loved her I was so obsessed with her
and I love his kids and everything so I would probably wake up as him to just
he okay another person okay sorry this [one] is also this [one] is also actually quite epic [ah] if I could wake up as her right is also really amazing
angelina jolie
cause she's also another like inspiration but like girl version [lah] actually I love zooey deschanel but I think angelina jolie has a bigger impact on the world [lah] she's like
okay <malay>dia tak</malay> resist to adopt like so many kids from different parts of the world
and then on top of that she's a humanitarian like the devoted humanitarian and like
on top of that she's angelina jolie like even if she didn't do all that humanitarian stuff right she's already awesome because people will love her as an entrepreneur
but she has all of that even more so it makes her even more like humane [ah] even more kind and imagine your ex-husband is brad pitt like the fish
so I would love to wake up as her and just also see what she does in a day [ah] like I think she's so inspiring [sia] like she's a mum to like
all types of kids like you know from vietnam to africa then they all really consider her as a mum she allows her kids to (err) explore religion and see what is beneficial to them and
ya she's connected with like different parts of the countries like of the world the third world that even we have never
she's even connected more with muslim countries so like ya I would love to be her [sia] for a day I think she's so inspiring like even though people love to villainies her because of the whole brad pitt and jennifer aniston thing but I feel like
that's so little compared to what she's done correct
ya at that moment I know it must have gone down so real but then again that's like twenty almost ten to twenty years ago
and it takes two hands to clap also and also like I think the relationship between brad pitt and angelina <malay>tu pun macam</malay> dysfunctioning at that point of time like because brad pitt did come up of thing to be saying that
jennifer still wanted to have fun <malay>macam</malay> you know they were they were high they were taking weed
and then like with jennifer with because with angelina she was already like wanting to have babies and like settle down whatsoever [lah]
but whatever it is ya [lah] like cheating cannot be justified [lah] right it is still wrong but
I still feel like brad pitt and (uh) angelina as a couple still made like more good than it was bad like not just it wasn't just for them but it was like for the whole world
even because of angelina jolie brad pitt also became more humanitarian and did stuff so like ya I really love her as a person
and then like when I see her older videos when she was younger right when she was like <malay>gila gila</malay>
like she's a gemini so I was like [sia] [lah] a true gemini [sia] this girl like she
she will be like she will seduce the the host and everything then make them criticism like [sia] that's like me but like back then [lah] when I was reckless [lah] so
I really love her so much because she also still has this really like you know vulnerable side of her
so ya jennifer ya and angelina jolie and then the actor joseph gordon levitt !wow!
ya [oh] my god you imagine if you can wake up as a K-pop artist though
imagine if you wake up as your (uh) stray kids or like
<malay>macam</malay> you go out you go out of the house and then like so many girls
what do you mean
ya because ya you have to be super disciplined
you can speak korean because that's the body's ability but then <malay>nanti ada orang melayu macam</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku faham</malay> [sia] <malay>dia cakap habis apa macam tapi</malay> how you learn that [sia]
<malay>botol</malay>
if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
ya ya like ya if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
caveman [ah]
ya
okay okay imagine so so you
[ah] ya ya <malay>tak payah pergi kerja</malay> so there's no nothing like you there's no transaction to get something or whatever so basically right maybe you can imagine the world in a in a more messed up way
like <malay>macam dah macam</malay> end of times [ah] <malay>tak ada kerja langsung</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> purge <malay>ke apa macam</malay>
it could be looked both ways it could be either super peaceful or either <malay>rabak</malay> it depends on the community I think
!huh! <malay>macam mana kau nak beli benda</malay> ya correct
ya if humans don't have to work to survive what would you I think I don't know what about the thing
until I die
[oh] maybe okay like so meaning transaction there still has to be transaction or something but it's not money anymore
so people has it you could be entertainment like you need this give me three dances
<malay>jangan kau</malay> messed up <malay>dangut sudah</malay> [sia] you need this you
ya what is your capability what can you do [ah] can you give me a massage
but I've already got three hugs from the girl before can you give me something more than a hug
(err) I can't
(err) no no no no okay okay okay take all the food you want
I feel like ya I feel like ya I feel like Netflix should do like a [seh] can just do a whole show based on this question alone like <malay>macam</malay> imagine [kan]
<malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah] singapore in general babe
<malay>dah banyak benda kita tak dia orang tak buat</malay> major it's so boring [sia]
no [lah] it's our opinion [mah]
we're not talking about the government we're talking about the opinion
but ya like the <malay>macam</malay>
okay [lah] obviously I appreciate like whatever is on channel five #suria# like they they definitely gave their best but I'm just saying
imagine if they did something more non realistic like not family drama and like <malay>macam</malay> just you know
[ah] like that's why Netflix shows always make it [what] right because the umbrella academy is not going to happen in real life like ya apocalypse <malay>ini semua</malay>
[oh] my god imagine
it would be so epic [sia]
okay definitely cannot be <malay>macam</malay> a one time hit thing <malay>pasal</malay> singapore <malay>satu</malay>
<malay>satu</malay> island <malay>dah jatuh</malay> babe ya <malay>dia kena macam sikit sikit sikit</malay> [lah]
but I think <malay>kalau macam</malay> there was like maybe a five episode show [ah] apocalypse in singapore [kan]
I think it'll be so funny because
like it's not meant to be funny but because you know like in singapore characters in general can be so
comedic like from there you know indian to the chinese to the malay then <malay>campur</malay> them together [eh] ya [sia] bro <malay>rabak</malay> already [sia] bro
!walao! [eh]
ya [lor] ya [lor] actually the races do get together when we are against like a specific
same government and then like suddenly like everybody aunty uncle <malay>mak cik</malay> all united
but then ya [lah] for but then the ones that was be standing at the answer end was like no ya where [ah]
ya what's next what's next
how do you think humans you will become extinct let's take this question in a sense that is we obviously know how [lah] right cause of islamic so
take that we imagine like imagine that's not the [lah] so it's just purely in our imaginations [ah]
[ah] how do you think humans will become extinct use your wildest imagination
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) correct
[eh] my god I can imagine [sia] my [one] is the zombie
[oh] he want to it could be anything [lah] ya like you said because global warming [ah] then you know factory they <malay>campak</malay> here <malay>campak</malay> there <malay>barang</malay> so like
so like using bandages [lah] obviously if you want to talk the islamic context we already know so we take that away this [one] is imagination is (um) ya I will just imagine that one person <malay>kena sakit</malay>
then after that (err) getting comfortable
<malay>sakit</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
<malay>dia tapi dia macam sakit biasa tahu jadi bila</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia sakit biasa habis dia dah mati tu</malay> [kan] doctor <malay>tu macam nak tengah nak tutup dia habis tu</malay> doctor <malay>tu sakit</malay> but from just sending <malay>tahu</malay>
then the doctor cough at the wife when he come back home then the wife <malay>sakit</malay> then the <malay>sakit</malay> she becomes the first zombie
then she becomes the first zombie then she bite her the husband she bite the child
then maybe we can place this <malay>selalu</malay> always the [lah] <malay>dapat</malay> all this kind of thing korea also already let's put this at malaysia very close home
so ya [lah] so then it starts from there then then you know malaysia people quite <malay>degil</malay> right they still want to <malay>surau</malay> they still want to <malay>solat</malay> at the <malay>masjid</malay> so they go and then <malay>orang masjid pula kena</malay>
<malay>gigit</malay> zombie and then very close to [oh] but then singapore is #kiasu# !huh! so from the first time we hear the one
person already <malay>kena</malay> then we already cut the borders so it's quite safe ya we already like
no [eh] but then [ah] you know the singapore and is like connected by that that
thing right I don't know I think our our government will
dian kuai dian</mandarin> [one] like very cut that bridge <malay>ataupun</malay> ya correct
because <malay>tak boleh</malay> already [sia] <malay>kau tahu kalau macam</malay> zombie <malay>yang macam macam itu besar boleh lari punya habis</malay> [sial] <malay>dia lari sudah sampai dah</malay> so we have to like they have to
okay says my imagination right is the fast type but they are allergic to water so they cannot swim to singapore
ya okay if they could if they could swim [ah] you know how <malay>singapura</malay> last time the history how we put the
you know the <malay>tajam-tajam</malay> that we couldn't let the sea the the <malay>ikan yang macam panjang</malay> [ah] correct
so we will go back to history and we'll do that so the cannot !wah! then like ya <malay>orang</malay> singapore will like train each other like <malay>macam</malay>
will train each other how to kill a zombie in case they will come everybody will be prepared it's not just the army but it's like everyone
but ya we got army for that so our army will be taking care from the inside the borders and kill all the zombies before they can come
so this is why like singapore becomes like the safest place to be at because we are the smallest
and we're like somehow <malay>tercampak</malay> from everyone else besides like (err) indonesia so ya but then this will
malaysia will spread to indon indon will spread to like the portuguese and then to thailand and then to eventually [lor]
so I think I give them one year or maybe one month [lah] then the whole world will die except for singapore
maybe singapore eventually [lah] when but singapore will be the last [lah] to die I will give us
ya I will give us the hero
so we will start the rationalising like crazy [lor] so we were all lose weight very drastically
[oh] okay obviously at each country [oh] ya because this [one] humans were extinct right no hope [what] so no choice [lah] everybody will die eventually depressing
alright
so bird flu <malay>semua</malay> we used to have bird flu [lah] swine flu [lah] <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] [seh] mad cow disease
ya because of a pandemic [seh]
ya <malay>macam</malay> case <malay>macam</malay> chronic <malay>gila macam kau</malay> once flu okay this person is going to die in two days
(err)
ya
(mm) ya [lor]
(uh) anyway
what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
[oh] my god [eh] wait wait wait but is activity [eh]
but then it ya it has to be an an eight hour straight work we're already doing eight hours so it's just like (err) maybe a normal activity you do but imagine you have to do it for eight hours damn
actually a lot of things [sia] anything if you do it repetitive for eight hours <malay>macam boleh merana</malay> [sia]
it doesn't have to be something you hate so it's just like everyday activity it would be torture if you had to do it eight hours
so imagine <malay>kalau kau</malay> brush your teeth it's a normal act <malay>tapi</malay> imagine you have to do it eight hours
gum <malay>kau dah dah dah dah dah sah dah sah dah kau dah</malay> over
ya so actually anything could be (err) <malay>ni kalau tapi</malay> exercise
<malay>cuma</malay> only maybe <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] it won't be a torture
<malay>pasal kau boleh tukar banyak</malay> channel [kan] <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kat rumah</malay>
ya <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kalau kau tengok</malay> different different <malay>cerita lain</malay> [ah] okay [ah] <malay>kalau kalau kau tengok</malay> the same show for eight hour then ya maybe [ah]
ya like okay so we're on to this the third round ya
but then if like because <malay>kalau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>cerita</malay> like (err) in general for eight hours it's not even like torture it's like it's what we do on like rest days like
next okay next
ya
ya unless your eating is like <malay>macam</malay> you can choose what you want to eat so maybe like eat <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> but
the real torture is like the person gave you <malay>nasi ayam</malay> okay you need to eat this <malay>nasi ayam</malay> for the next eight hours repetitively
eat damn slow [lah] like one rice at a time cannot already I think ya exercising definitely [lah] like [sia] I imagine like running running for eight hours
<malay>orang boleh mati</malay> [sia] from exhaustion exhaustion exhaustion what other everyday activity that you wouldn't think is a torture but it's a torture if you do it for eight hours
I think washing your face like washing your face with a facial scrub <malay>lapan jam</malay> straight
<malay>kau punya kulit boleh</malay> dry [sia]
[oh] my god <malay>rabak gila</malay> actually anything that you do to do your body for eight hours [ah]
everything what other thing maybe is the (err)
sometimes he dust it at eight hours so he thinks eight hours always like that now <malay>penat aku</malay> like clean the like you know he do the whole thing
but that [one] is like quite therapeutic [sia] sometimes too ya
ya honestly sleeping but then sleeping you know eight hours
ya
sleeping is always eight hours also you don't [lor] I'm willing to torture myself for eight hours if it's sleep
I think [ah] ya I don't know why I thought of brushing teeth straightaway that's like (ugh) eight hours <malay>sakit</malay> [sia] <malay>gigi aku</malay>
what other things that we do like everyday activities [sia]
pee imagine like someone force you to pee for eight hours
pee some more pee some more I can did I try
produce more lube liquid
how how many more minutes
I think around twelve minutes
(uh) (uh)
<malay>teruk</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku macam ada</malay> high pitch moment (uh) <malay>bila</malay> excited <malay>macam ni</malay> so ya
if you
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
if you had if you have any unusual superpower what would what would it be
what
!walao! [eh]
and it's not like it's not as such a major thing that will ya change the rest of your life
it will just inconvenience them for like one day so it's like a good good
ya [lor] then we just like then we just like diarrhoea
then he like (ugh) okay nevermind you
ya it is the most innocent
like revenge but it is a useful [one]
how did you think that at the tip of your mind it must mean you have had thoughts right
if it's for yourself <malay>macam</malay>
would you want the unusual power to be like see the ghosts
ya <malay>macam</malay> I
but even then he was so depressed for like so many years of his life he was so like schizophrenic
but this [one] even more [sia] you cannot sleep in peace [eh] you sleeping there [lah] then like then got hi
then another [one] hi the patient will like (uh) shut up
you all want to talk to me can I'm going to control you
please entertain me now
ya he was very that's why he became like a drinking drug addict he wanted to run away from all the ghosts so irritating [sia] like everyday every second you have to listen to them talk
so many exactly
and some are nice and some are ya and they're not visually looking nice
alright okay so
ya [lor] who know you got the dark secret but ya [lah] I think seeing ghosts is more of like a curse than it is a blessing [ah]
but I mean there are people out there who can see third eyes so I hope they have it fixed in their life
ya <malay>kau pernah</malay> other vulnerable component like you just you know I want to go on current god do you like the how is it whatever the I I also have
[oh] ya <malay>kau pernah</malay> like <malay>dengar kawan kawan kau ada</malay> third eye how is it for them like I I also have
[ah] of course #wei# <malay>menyusahkan</malay> [sia]
ya ya ya
correct I but I don't know whether they can choose that option to <malay>tutup</malay> that <malay>batin</malay> I think
I think they maybe can but cannot go to <malay>bomoh</malay> [lah] go to an <malay>ustaz</malay> or something [lah] a skilled <malay>ustaz</malay>
I also have like my friend's friend [ah] <malay>dia pun boleh nampak benda</malay> so <malay>macam</malay>
it's not everytime <malay>akan ada benda</malay> but <malay>macam</malay> sometimes [ah] so <malay>macam tengah lepak ataupun</malay>
<malay>lepak kat luar pun nanti dia cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>ada benda</malay> [ah] <malay>kat situ</malay> [ah] <malay>atau dalam bilik macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>ada benda kat sini</malay> [ah]
you mean like there's friends who will fake it
ya [lah]
are they constant <malay>tu</malay> or are they consistent
but it's too dramatic [ah]
[oh] they want to scare you [sia] basically <malay>dah tak</malay> #sui# [ah] sis
girl or boy
[oh] I know him [sia] <malay>nak saja takutkan ni</malay>
ya ya boyfriend <malay>mana ni</malay>
[oh] I hate that everytime I ask about that ex you <malay>tak</malay> even refer <malay>nama dia kau</malay> just <malay>panggil dia misai</malay>
and I hate also that <malay>aku boleh macam</malay> [oh] ya as
though you only have one ex with one <malay>misai</malay> but
because his <malay>misai</malay> was the most evident ya
ya ya ya
how old is he again [ah] one year older [eh] or your age
[oh]
twenty six [eh] twenty eight
[oh] nineteen eighty nine that's quite old
see how is he doing our you know (uh) it's the same (uh) the popular do example in boring know holiday get social media guitar but the girl number but marching to jackie either look ya ya time right my checks you know okay so for me my unusual super
is he how is he doing now do you know
<malay>kau</malay> follow <malay>dia dekat</malay> social media <malay>ke tak</malay>
okay <malay>ada</malay> low key [ah] alright
okay so for me my unusual super power <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
I think [ah] the super power that <malay>siapa</malay> that
aunt allyson has [eh] is damn
ya [eh] it's damn strong [sia] babe you can literally manipulate the whole world
but it is I mean it it ya but it can be quite messed up if she was villain
luckily she's not a villain babe if she's a villain she can get everything her way
ya [lah] so that's why I said unless she use that power only
for like <malay>betul-betul</malay> like for bad people then like <malay>macam</malay> let's say this bad person was going to kill someone then
she can whisper them like <malay>macam</malay> you are not going to this you are going to try and believe in yourself you know
use it for really so the person that has that power has such as strong responsibility not to misuse it <malay>tau</malay> not for herself
and not to make someone like or someone whatever situation worse [ah]
I would love that power
like but we cannot <malay>macam</malay> do it for them as in for example a guy who is immature right we cannot be like
okay you're now going to be mature I feel like we can't do that because
<malay>macam</malay> cheat code [ah] <malay>macam</malay> they don't go through the process so it's more like you are going to start going therapy
then we plant the seeds for them so that's why we even with the robber that I said just now right like let's say he was going to rob someone
I could have said okay you're now going to be a good person starting tomorrow to me it doesn't feel authentic from him
so that's why it it has to be like okay from today on you going to reflect on yourself why you're doing this and you're going to question the
purpose of life [ah] so just plant a seed and then see where they take ya I think for allison
I mean it's not her fault [lah] [kan] because like with that power nobody knows how to really use it [what] and she had to go through her downs for her to like [oh] shit to ya learn that
I can't use it but then again [eh] honestly I know her ex-husband hated her cause she used that for her daughter right
but then <malay>macam</malay>
and also <malay>macam</malay> I I get it like I also wouldn't want my partner to be misusing it on my child but
the what she asked for her daughter was kind of a small thing [what] it was like a
I heard rumour that you don't want to read the book anymore
so ya but I mean it is messed up but messed up to a point that <malay>nak sampai</malay> divorce <malay>semua macam</malay>
chill [lah] like sort of like she rumour you <malay>tak berapa baik</malay> [lah]
<malay>kau ingat yang</malay> the part where ellen page <malay>pergi</malay> slice the car
everytime they reshow that scene I'm like so graphic
I always thought she died [seh] for good right
but the it's like she's just what the fish [sia]
ya ya ya but it's so <malay>kesian</malay> in the season two end up she never use but her husband irritating
[oh] and then he's said [oh] why didn't you use this earlier so to what get you like clothes !wow!
ya and you are the one who preaches about being the change the movement and then like
and then you are the same person who's like so did you use it on me like
<malay>kau</malay> just enjoy <malay>dia punya</malay> power <malay>habis kau nak</malay> use it the definition of toxic men [sia] babe <malay>aku</malay> throughout the movie <malay>aku</malay> just like
ya
ya
like get go I was trying to obviously give him the benefit of the doubt [lah] [kan] <malay>pasal dia macam</malay>
this like heroic black man but then as we go go through <malay>macam</malay> and he's not
I feel like allison is compromising a lot [sia] she's so nice like nah
luther [sia] <malay>aku</malay> prefer bluther with allison even though in the first season I was like [meh] but
seeing the way ray treated her I'm like at least luther is genuine [sia] and
he loves her as she is he so cute when they're so awkward
alright
okay so maybe last question
what is the one thing you wish was free
[oh] my god
(mm) that's why
okay [ah]
[oh] my god you're so right
ya [lor] stay here forever [lah]
but that's the thing right
ya but you stay at your own house [mah]
okay maybe maybe not rent maybe is buying a house because rent right if it's free how to say [ah] it is still like monthly right so if you buy a house it's free like
no one in singapore is going to buy a house it's like automatic when you're twenty one a house is registered to your name
<malay>dia tu baru cakap kau sayang</malay> citizen <malay>kau</malay>
like okay at twenty one you are all
(err) entitled to a
yes one room flat but then <malay>nak kena ada</malay> conditions to pass [lah] so you must like graduate <malay>ini semua</malay> okay so if you haven't met that those conditions you still live with your parents
then it moves to okay twenty five okay if (err) twenty five you are now entitled to a four room flat
but then if you still haven't met that conditions then it's either <malay>kau</malay> can get the twenty one year old house <malay>ataupun</malay> stay with your parents
and then the last will be thirty years old which is like a five room flat because <malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>semua dah ada anak semua apa</malay>
so it's all government <malay>dah macam</malay> plan <malay>untuk kau orang</malay>
and it's not like <malay>semua dapat</malay> [what] it's like there's conditions [what] so it's also it makes sense [what] right
but ya bro that was a that was a good idea what else what else could be free I think
damn cannot [lah] [seh]
ya that's why ya the ration is over there because the thing is with food is free obviously <malay>orang yang tak tamak</malay> okay [lah] [kan]
<malay>tapi kau</malay> imagine [lah] <malay>orang yang kau tahu kau tahu yang macam dah suka belum apa-apa dah pergi</malay> hog <malay>semua</malay> exactly <malay>kau</malay> imagine
then will be like
ya <malay>takkan dia sapu</malay>
ya no food I think food can't be free I think if I really want one food that is free [ah] one thing that is free is [ah] <malay>ni</malay> sanitary pad
yes why do we have to pay for something that will be with us for ya
ya [lah] I get that like the factories did all these and they have to be paid but I mean I don't know
do you really have to pay like
condoms okay [lah]
but condoms <malay>mana satu pun orang kasi</malay> free free per
alright (uh)
so anyway (uh) babe (uh) <malay>kau</malay> wish <malay>aku</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> interview <malay>aku</malay>
[eh] babe thanks [ah] <malay>pasal kau macam berbual dengan aku semua so aku dah</malay> have a gauge
what do you mean what you mean person interview a political up all right
[oh] right right right right okay [eh] I get to know you more [lah] [seh] babe from here
