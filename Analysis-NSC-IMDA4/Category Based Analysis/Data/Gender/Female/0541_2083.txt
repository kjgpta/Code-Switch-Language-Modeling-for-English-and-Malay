alright #mahirah#
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
[ha] <malay>nampak</malay>
beauty in everyone okay this is a
topic <malay>ni berat</malay> [eh] topic <malay>ni</malay> is very this topic is <malay>orang kata</malay> very wide <malay>dia punya</malay> spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in terms of everything not just
(uh) look wise <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in (uh) nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is <malay>memang kita boleh</malay> counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
(uh) time <malay>kita berbual</malay>
so okay <malay>kita</malay> start <malay>gini</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>kita</malay> start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay <malay>kau kau</malay> start <malay>dulu apa kau punya</malay> definition of beauty <malay>pada kau</malay>
yes
okay
[oh] that would <malay>tu bagus tu</malay> yes that that is <malay>bagus</malay> (err) <malay>bagus bagus</malay>
for me
for me okay aku</malay>
I don't see myself as <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> victoria's secret <malay>punya</malay> type <malay>punya ke lawa memang tak</malay> [lah] <malay>memang</malay> not even near that [lah] but because I I have my insecurities (um) based on appearance <malay>juga</malay> which <malay>itu pun</malay> is another topic [eh] <malay>kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu</malay> about me about
but but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
which people in our society is blinded by that <malay>sebab</malay>
standard <malay>kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau</malay> people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
<malay>tapi</malay> for me beauty <malay>kalau kau lawa pun mana pun</malay> but if your if your attitude is <malay>macam gitu</malay> then
then <malay>memang</malay> you know what I mean
<malay>memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan</malay> as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective <malay>ramai orang ada</malay> different <malay>punya</malay> perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just (uh) it's between the both of us what is our definition
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
beauty in a long term !woo!
(mmhmm)
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
[oh] okay for me my <malay>kawan</malay> the friends that I go like the friends that I <malay>cari atau dapat</malay> it's okay we we can talk about poly ya <malay>kita punya</malay> poly days is <malay>kita tak</malay> I I don't see like [oh] <malay>kau lawa</malay> I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kau lawa</malay> I was going to say you no no no no I never <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean I don't know for me <malay>memang</malay> I don't see
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather I rather not
go towards that <malay>sebab</malay> it's not gonna be a genuine <malay>punya</malay> relationship you know
<malay>sebab</malay> it's just gonna be
for clout <malay>macam</malay> you know you know some people (uh) there there is some (uh) cliques <malay>ke apa</malay> whatever in school <malay>yang macam</malay> okay <malay>sebab kau lawa kau</malay> popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame <malay>dia ada</malay> attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is <malay>memang</malay> maybe not because during after <malay>kalau</malay> your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person <malay>yang macam</malay> will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
<malay>macam</malay> for me and you [eh] <malay>macam</malay> this is <malay>kita pun semalam baru jumpa</malay> [eh] we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like <malay>kita punya</malay> relationship first first <malay>kita</malay> start from sec one
and until now it last <malay>ramai</malay> of my other friends <malay>macam kita dah macam</malay> you know after that <malay>macam dah</malay> start to <malay>putik putus</malay> but with you and (err) (err) our friends yesterday it is a long lasting <malay>macam kita tak</malay> awkward [tau] and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever #inshaallah#
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know <malay>kita punya</malay> chemistry <malay>kita punya</malay> behaviour
<malay>kita punya</malay> personality because okay imagine <malay>kalau</malay> the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine <malay>kita takde macam makan orang makan orang</malay> you know what I mean like like betray or
or jealousy no that it it is really a general relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
<malay>tak payah cari</malay> beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any <malay>betul tak tu</malay>
<malay>apa kau rasa apa kau rasa</malay>
<malay>cerita sikit cerita sikit</malay>
(mm)
go towards the beauty or
[oh] damn
(mm)
(mmhmm)
like fashion wise you know is it [oh] damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course <malay>pun ada juga yang</malay> those type of cliques that
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are (um)
(uh) handsome (uh) <malay>lelaki kat dalam</malay> my course <malay>yang baik yang</malay> humble <malay>yang tahu yang dia orang tak</malay> stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also (um)
(uh) girls that they they <malay>dia orang punya dia orang macam</malay> you know they have that that beauty standard [lah] <malay>dia orang ada</malay> that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are <malay>sombong</malay> they are arrogant you know
so so <malay>macam</malay> it's a
I don't know (err) <malay>macam</malay> for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say <malay>kalau kau lawa</malay> you should then (uh) take advantage of it like you know you should your personality <malay>pun kena bagus</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> but but people people who are <malay>lawa</malay> usually you know you know <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna <malay>ada</malay> that ego you know that ego that that it depends [lah] how you are brought up you know
which is (um) it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them [lah]
ya very subjective
(mm)
true true but overall selecting friends with with (uh) with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not (uh) it's not the right way to do [lah] I would say
so ya it's not
not just that [lah] beauty in terms of you know right (uh) now we are all going to that stage of working [kan] it's always <malay>kalau</malay> it's always <malay>macam</malay> you see this (um)
if there's if there's a competition you know what I mean
not just competition but <malay>macam</malay> okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that <malay>macam sebab</malay> this person is sexy <malay>ke apa ada</malay> landed job
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
I mean that is for us <malay>yang mungkin macam</malay> of a lower standard
it's not it's unfair [what] because you should pick someone of (uh) of of talent of skills instead of beauty
(mm)
[oh] yes
pay plays an important role
(mm)
design
F&B
social service ya
true true
<malay>betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur</malay> [eh] I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that (uh)
this we can say about our <malay>macam</malay> okay in the future <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak cari</malay> (um)
a a partner in life your (uh)
is beauty important <malay>macam</malay> appearance wise or the best is <malay>macam</malay> mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
(uh huh)
that is true of course of course first ya you will see the appearance [one] or not
ya <malay>tu memang tu memang tu memang</malay>
ada yang suka</malay> cute cute <malay>ada yang suka macam</malay> E-boy E-boy
true true true true
(uh) no (err) not not not the first (uh) judgement because because first judgement <malay>memang</malay> is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but (uh) overall <malay>macam</malay> to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
me too me too
I think I think
okay <malay>kau</malay> okay <malay>kau kau</malay> share <malay>kau</malay> share <malay>dulu</malay> cause <malay>ni pun</malay> (uh) is an interesting fact
for me for me right I I got a
okay I will share you later you you share first
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
what's the point [kan]
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] first judgement yes appearance <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> the the act of (uh) sharing <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) caring the your you <malay>punya</malay> personality that is beautiful so
<malay>macam</malay> I think beauty [eh] is is
is again subjective <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>ada orang</malay> [eh] they say <malay>macam asalkan kau kemas</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kau</malay> (err) you are clean you clean yourself <malay>macam</malay> it <malay>macam bukanlah</malay> you I'm asking you <malay>macam pergi</malay> plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
(uh) I'm not I'm not gonna talk about myself (err)
but but overall <malay>macam</malay> the of how you take care of yourself <malay>macam</malay> for the <malay>macam kita</malay> how we how we like its like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we <malay>kita basuh muka</malay> something like that you know
things like that this little things that will build up (um)
the sense of beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> beauty [eh] is again <malay>macam</malay> very it can be very (um)
stressful for some people
<malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know (uh) I I got this <malay>macam macam</malay> experience <malay>kalau</malay> we we talk with our friends <malay>ke apa</malay> we always like <malay>ada juga</malay> topic topic <malay>yang macam ini maknanya macam</malay> anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of (uh) people
(uh) again it's it's about (um) <malay>macam</malay> low self esteem you know <malay>kau ada</malay> face <malay>gitu tak aku ada</malay> I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that <malay>macam</malay> to me I find that
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
<malay>macam kau</malay> do do you have any like (um)
insecurities <malay>ataupun macam</malay> low self esteem towards this kind of (uh) topic
I <malay>pun sama</malay>
handsome
<malay>sama sama sama sama</malay> for me <malay>sama</malay> (err) like I think
<malay>susah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
unless <malay>kita kes yang macam</malay> our confidence level is very high ya but of course
<malay>terdetik</malay> [lah] <malay>kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang</malay> very <malay>kita rasa macam</malay> [eh] !alamak! you know what I mean
ya
I I came across this one (uh) (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) it's a meme [lah] the it's a kid the kid says <malay>macam</malay> the kid was saying (uh) <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> to god [tau] god (uh)
if (uh) can you make me (uh) beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
okay but I think <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
for me <malay>pun times <malay>yang</malay> I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful [lah] you know which is a wrong mindset <malay>sebab</malay> that means [eh]
I'm I'm okay this to me towards me I'm I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
[oh] that means when if I'm beauty
if I'm (uh) pretty I will get somewhere I would get (uh) at least a modelling job <malay>ke apa</malay> you know at least I have something <malay>tapi</malay>
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
<malay>tapi okay <malay>siapa tak nak lawa</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa tak nak</malay> handsome <malay>buat apa dalam dunia ni</malay>
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
(um) <malay>tadi nak tanya tanya seribu</malay> question <malay>boleh</malay>
yes yes
yes
[oh] !wow!
girls or boys
I think [kan] for me okay <malay>kita kita perempuan</malay> [kan] but I I think (um) generally generally speaking [kan] I think it's the girls is it but not me [lah]
subjective subjective but but I think [kan] it's more towards the girls <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we have like boys and girls is different [what] <malay>kita punya</malay> how we hangout how we
again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
<malay>pergi</malay> towards that that
that <malay>apa tu tujuan</malay> like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
but
to you <malay>apa</malay> to you which one for you
ya
really
practical
(mm)
ya ya ya <malay>macam</malay> in terms of gossiping also [lah] you can say that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which <malay>macam</malay> for for girls maybe some of them will talk about [eh] look at that I mean [eh] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] have you heard this about I heard about <malay>macam</malay> some of my friends (uh) classmate <malay>dia macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok tu</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok dia ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok</malay> you know they we they are always <malay>macam</malay>
you can say (err) comparing [eh] comparing
(uh) judgy but
that's kind of the topic <malay>yang</malay>
for you know me and you <malay>kita tak kita</malay> we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then (uh) (uh) most likely is the
<malay>kaum wanita</malay> [lah] it's always <malay>kaum wanita</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya ya but (uh) (uh) (um) to mention <malay>macam orang yang tak lawa</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> but it's <malay>kini</malay> it's how society <malay>pandang</malay> you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know <malay>sebab</malay> this is how society looks <malay>sebab</malay> to be honest who started this thing called <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) okay (uh) <malay>kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau</malay> if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this (uh) or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing <malay>mesti ada dulu</malay> maybe in history <malay>ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang macam</malay>
okay <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>macam ni</malay> I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with (um) you can say <malay>ni lumrah manusia</malay> [tau] you know <malay>kau tahu benda ni macam</malay> this human standard the world doesn't do this [tau] it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually <malay>kalau kalau</malay> we all treat people the equally (uh) got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having (uh) insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem <malay>sebab</malay> it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
<malay>macam</malay> okay I'm not gonna I'm not <malay>sebab</malay> you get it's subjective it depends some <malay>ada</malay> some parts of the world <malay>takde macam gini</malay> but some parts some of the world
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
that is very <malay>macam sebab</malay> it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning [what] that's why <malay>ramai orang macam ada yang</malay> every article is that people suicide you know
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
<malay>tak payah cakap pasal</malay> you <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] it it can be because maybe <malay>sebab</malay> (uh) you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you [what] <malay>betul</malay> [what] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang tak kacau kau apa</malay> or like they judge you base on your (uh) clothing <malay>ke</malay> based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can (uh) about also about also <malay>macam</malay> status
hierarchy system <malay>macam kaya</malay> and poor
this kind of thing is what
it's all lumrah manusia</malay> it's all (uh) human standards
which I think is
is is <malay>tak berapa bagus</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
not just beauty [tau] <malay>macam pasal</malay> poor and rich <malay>pun boleh jadi</malay> problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen (uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak</malay> [kan] <malay>macam budak budak ada yang kena</malay> outcast [kan] you know what I mean
this one is is this this kind of thing [lah] that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what I mean
[oh] dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
functional [eh]
[oh] ya
that <malay>macam</malay> (uh) the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
ya competition (err) competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that (uh) after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit <malay>macam betul</malay> [lah] like
there there will be a president there will be (uh) our manager there will be our the boss
<malay>takkan semua sama</malay> right <malay>pekerja</malay> then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work [what] because
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
true true true so <malay>memang ini</malay>
lumrah</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>memang memang</malay> it's the world [lah] it's just it evolve like this [lah] to be honest <malay>mesti</malay> there is there is gonna be (uh) plus minus there plus minus <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam kau tahu</malay> okay (uh) <malay>dunia hiburan</malay>
about okay (uh) western world <malay>atau</malay> K pop [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for example that kind of thing
usually <malay>yang lawa</malay> [jer] <malay>pun yang disanjung disanjung</malay> <malay>disanjung</malay>
usually it's it's gonna be the the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be (uh)
[eh] actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean <malay>punya</malay>
the K pop world you know what I mean <malay>sebab</malay> in western world we don't look at beauty [what] we we we judge based on (uh) music wise <malay>kalau kita suka kita suka macam</malay> for example like
(uh) there are (uh) idols <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> okay (uh) like
<malay>tak</malay> I think <malay>macam</malay> it's different <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> compare we cannot compare like western <malay>punya</malay> industry like the hollywood and and also K pop <malay>sebab</malay> K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol <malay>atau</malay> the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
<malay>yang lain semua</malay> you know especially when you're in a group of (uh) like of <malay>kau pernah kau pernah</malay> (uh) come across this article <malay>tak dia macam</malay> there's this one idol <malay>dia punya</malay> member <malay>tak berapa lawa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
to me it's fine [lah] but it's <malay>ada sikit macam</malay> different <malay>daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa</malay> then all the all the <malay>macam</malay> the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is <malay>tak tak</malay> not of a pretty <malay>tapi</malay> is in the middle
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
so I think that is also <malay>rabak</malay> [lah] to be honest
[oh] my god like
[ah] <malay>memilih kasih padahal sama</malay> group [tau] <malay>padahal</malay> they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead [lah] like like why <malay>sanjung</malay> (uh) idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people <malay>sebab ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang</malay> news turns out that [oh] this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans <malay>tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu</malay> the fans doesn't (uh)
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
yes you said it <malay>betul apa</malay>
(uh) same like macam
<malay>macam</malay> you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish <malay>tapi</malay> okay but see this is how beauty
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side (err) but the the the the negative side about
beauty [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
the look at the people will just support this (uh) this the group of
based on their
(uh) sexiness <malay>ke</malay> based on their face <malay>ke</malay> or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards (uh) bad <malay>punya</malay>
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as (uh) the <malay>macam</malay> those those fans <malay>yang sanjung sangat</malay> [kan] it's not (uh) it's not it's not a good habit for them [what] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like <malay>macam</malay> harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
so that is the negative side [lah] about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
<malay>macam kau tak payah ada</malay> beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
<malay>tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> (um) oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the <malay>lawa</malay> the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that (uh) hosting <malay>punya</malay> and she can be successful you know what I mean
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way [lah] but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
<malay>yang benda apa tu yang benda</malay>
<malay>yang benda</malay> (uh) success
(mmhmm)
true true
it also goes with <malay>macam</malay> top (uh) fashion wise you know what I mean
<malay>macam kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu</malay> (uh) okay <malay>zaman sekarang</malay> right you know if you were to just wear like (uh) sloppy
<malay>macam</malay> T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then <malay>kita pergi kedai mamak</malay> something like that right
<malay>kedai</malay> (uh) #kopitiam# or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think <malay>macam</malay> they they will look at us like [eh] <malay>dia ni biar betul</malay> you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where <malay>kita kita</malay> I'm gonna feel <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) it's okay (err) but like [eh] like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
<malay>tapi</malay> get it it's it's how era goes you know <malay>sebab zaman dulu</malay> imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right <malay>dulu</malay> time maybe like early two thousand
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example [eh] and then you call you wear (uh)
a dress with heels to a #kopitiam# people will look at you <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you <malay>biar betul</malay>
<malay>lain macam</malay> but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
(uh) think <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau lawa macam</malay> it's fine
so see how this (uh) the the era <malay>macam</malay> how (uh) move [eh] you know what I mean
<malay>lain</malay> [eh] which is weird [eh] <malay>macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir</malay> !wah!
as time goes by
as technology becomes more <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) better and more (uh)
<malay>orang kata apa lagi gempak</malay> then
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay (um)
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(mm)
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
!wow! okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it (mm)
true true
[oh] yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean (um) ya ya ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in <malay>macam</malay> those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters <malay>dia orang nak</malay> step [jer] <malay>macam</malay> they just follow the trend you know what I mean
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
I think saturated
I think there is like <malay>macam</malay> photos trend I guess <malay>kita kita</malay> use simpler (uh) simpler terms [eh]
I would say today this
(uh) of (uh) twenty twenty of the twenty first century
as you know <malay>macam</malay> around starting to see because here I feel it
it's not (um) it's because (uh) as technology evolves we evolve
you know what I mean <malay>sekarang</malay> (uh) is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is (uh) <malay>macam</malay> instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
(uh) facebook twitter youtube
(uh) this kind of thing (uh) <malay>macam</malay> pinterest (uh)
<malay>dulu</malay> tumblr okay tiktok <malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok [kan]
<malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's <malay>punya</malay> life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols <malay>ke</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> favourite <malay>punya</malay> artist (uh) kim K <malay>ke</malay> whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so <malay>maknanya</malay>
due to that that's why (uh) people are like following <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl <malay>tapi</malay> you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
<malay>tapi</malay> to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing (err) you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like <malay>suka dia punya</malay> style <malay>macam</malay> some people you can we see [oh] I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means <malay>tapi</malay> you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya <malay>macam</malay> that is that is not the right way <malay>sebab macam kau kena</malay> genuine with yourself [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
imagine you are not like that right <malay>tapi sebab kau nampak</malay> (uh) your maybe your cliques are all <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you (uh) if you just change your clothing then it's fine <malay>tapi</malay> you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing <malay>kalau</malay> if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good (uh) circle of friends that is a good company <malay>tapi</malay> if you start to <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>maaf cakap</malay> [eh] this can be very sensitive <malay>sebab</malay> imagine if your circle of friends (uh) <malay>macam</malay> smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>buat</malay>
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't (uh) people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right <malay>macam</malay> you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in <malay>macam</malay>
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
with people <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] I I say you don't need to get okay <malay>macam mana kau nak</malay> get this thing
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a (uh) company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
(uh) stage you know what I mean
so <malay>macam</malay> you know like (um) you know they say there's a saying <malay>macam</malay> (uh) everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] like
(err) <malay>macam</malay> the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset <malay>tapi</malay> you you don't
(uh)
have the same people that will hold you back
but because everyone's <malay>macam kau</malay>
needs a level up you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> level of for the good
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
<malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like see this is how (uh) trend setting <malay>macam</malay>
fashion wise (uh) people are now using (uh) fewer are following the more of the K pop
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it <malay>tapi</malay> if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later <malay>tapi</malay> if you follow that kind of group <malay>yang buat benda tak elok</malay> then (uh) then you should
you should have your own pride [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean <malay>kau punya</malay> pride <malay>kau tak payah</malay> follow <malay>orang lain punya orang lain punya</malay> instruction <malay>ada betul</malay>
<malay>boleh boleh boleh</malay> shoot [jer] shoot
go [jer]
(mmhmm)
value is it popular popularity (mm)
(mmhmm)
self love
<malay>pandang rendah</malay> is it <malay>pandang rendah</malay> you look down on them [oh]
okay for me
as long as you know
where you stand <malay>macam mana</malay> you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group <malay>macam tadi kau cakap</malay>
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead <malay>macam</malay> if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your <malay>macam</malay> it will lead you to a success <malay>atau macam</malay> lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead <malay>sebab</malay> if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's <malay>sebab</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends you know what I mean like quotation <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends <malay>punya pasal</malay> then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good (uh) there is not a good <malay>tujuan sebab kalau kau</malay> really <malay>nak</malay>
I mean you know some people <malay>macam</malay> for me no [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for me I got this thing where
<malay>kalau aku takde kawan</malay> then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
<malay>kita nampak</malay> I've I've I've seen this
where
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the group [kan] <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the clique and then <malay>dia cari orang lain</malay> immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much <malay>macam</malay> you like like <malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own (uh) <malay>pendirian daripada</malay>
I I think (uh) I need to find I need to find a friend because (uh) because people might think <malay>nanti macam</malay> I got problem
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that (uh) circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find (uh) someone that really is genuine in your friendship
same goes like your question <malay>tadi</malay> whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so <malay>sebab</malay> if the loner if that loner sometimes loner <malay>tu</malay> feels that
there's nothing wrong (uh) he he or she is of a good (uh) direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I <malay>kita</malay> support <malay>aku</malay> support <malay>tapi kalau</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on [oh] <malay>kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan</malay> you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish [lah] I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
<malay>sebab</malay> if you want to go for me [eh] <malay>aku aku</malay> I like to keep my circle of friends close <malay>macam</malay> just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know <malay>sebab</malay> to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
you know <malay>kawan kosong</malay> and <malay>kawan</malay> that is really true
ya so back to your question where <malay>kalau</malay> the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but <malay>kalau</malay> you it's hard it's hard to say <malay>macam</malay> for me you know I just say but if I were to
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or whatever right
<malay>tapi</malay> what I I can advice <malay>macam</malay>
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
<malay>tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab</malay> they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
<malay>dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau</malay> they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
so go ahead like (um) move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
<malay>kau kalau kau macam mana</malay>
yes I I still remember our first our first
<malay>macam</malay> you you know <malay>kita aku</malay> case <malay>macam</malay> the clown [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the <malay>kita ni ni macam</malay> podcast [eh] <malay>tapi macam</malay> okay for those who <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert <malay>macam</malay> I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met #mahirah# [kan] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>dia macam pendiam</malay> [tau] but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>mahirah aku</malay>
ya it take a long time not years [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no <malay>aku</malay> respect <malay>kau sebab</malay> okay you you call yourself introvert right

<malay>kau</malay> chairperson [seh] <malay>kau</malay> your leadership skill is really <malay>aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik</malay> (err) <malay>sebab</malay> your leadership is the best
so and

<malay>macam ajar</malay> then !wah!
(um) <malay>tak payah cakap pasal</malay> beauty [lah] it's <malay>macam dia punya</malay> attitude wise you know what I mean
ya so role model
the is that <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you want to say like like western <malay>punya</malay> or like <malay>macam barat</malay>
(uh) <malay>pelakon ke apa</malay> [kan] then I would say #neelofa#
#neelofa# #neelofa#
is the ya malaysian <malay>punya</malay> actress host (uh) business woman <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>kalau kau tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia buat</malay> this brand <malay>apa yang neelofa punya tudung</malay> and then she's she's she's successful <malay>sampai pergi</malay> (uh)
milan (uh) to the the business <malay>berkembang</malay>
like real be and and she's very #muslimah# also so I thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
she is a great (uh) host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something <malay>dia masih belum berpunya</malay> she's still single but her driven of (uh) being that success both <malay>dunia</malay> and <malay>akhirat aku boleh cakap</malay>
it's it's like !wah! <malay>macam</malay>
it's something that <malay>macam</malay> you god bless you you know
ya I take that as a as a
(uh) role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and (uh) of a islam (uh) muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing <malay>apa tadi kau nak cakap</malay>
#wallah#
<malay>betul betul betul</malay> the I mean the the the life the hereafter [lah]
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
(mm) (mm)
ya <malay>tu</malay> [oh] my god singapore living ya
(mmhmm)
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is !wow! I think <malay>memang</malay> it's very rare no not just both <malay>tapi</malay> your character <malay>pun baik</malay> your personality <malay>pun baik</malay>
those who have that
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost <malay>macam</malay>
role model [lah] I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man <malay>yang macam</malay> you know that you have okay for the guys handsome (uh) <malay>bekerjaya</malay> and (um) (uh) <malay>apa</malay> we can <malay>cakap apa</malay> faithful is it faithful and then (um) of a good personality then
<malay>memang susah nak cari</malay> but these are the people <malay>yang macam</malay> you <malay>risau tapi</malay> again to those <malay>yang kita</malay> okay <malay>kita boleh (uh) <malay>rumuskan</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab</malay> we got like a few more minutes <malay>tapi</malay> (um) what I can say is that we shouldn't just (um) we shouldn't just
(uh) okay what's that word [eh] I want to say that this <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kita kita jangan</malay> just <malay>tengok yang lawa kita</malay> just <malay>tengok yang</malay> handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't (err) okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance <malay>sebab</malay>
it will just make you <malay>rasa diri</malay> you <malay>yang kalau</malay> you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we <malay>atau</malay> whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down [what] like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this <malay>macam</malay> successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself <malay>kalau</malay> just you know what I mean like
(um) like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
<malay>betul</malay> you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of (uh) just be humble be kind I think <malay>kalau</malay> at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character <malay>betul tak</malay>
so just ya just be on that don't worry <malay>kalau</malay>
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same [lah] just human being
ya
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly <malay>macam</malay> choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you <malay>macam</malay> you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know <malay>bila</malay>
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
so then you just be humble [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself [lah]
(mm)
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no (uh) okay how about before that we say
(err) the one thing we regret
you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then <malay>baru kita</malay> move on to ten years down the road what should we
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
!wow! that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
<malay>macam</malay> it it it has come to a point where
<malay>macam</malay> because of beauty [lah] because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself <malay>ni macam takde</malay> value
and it has come to a point where <malay>macam</malay> whatever people take one for me <malay>aku macam mengalah aku</malay> like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
to have like prioritise in me <malay>sebab</malay> I I tend to like
to like <malay>macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang</malay> [seh]
you know what I mean so it has I should be more <malay>macam</malay> have that confidence which I I <malay>aku tu tu</malay> last time [eh] <malay>tu</malay> last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
(uh) the respect that you you're given by society that is more
so to the next ya (uh) future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road <malay>apa kau punya</malay> advice
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
[oh] message to [oh] okay okay
[oh] okay that's good that's good
(mm)
true
true true that is that is important and <malay>macam</malay> to just have that little selfishness in you so that
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued [lah] in this world into serious [eh] for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
<malay>ni</malay> is important <malay>betul</malay> okay
ellen <malay>punya</malay> ellen put aside [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> this is my <malay>pendirian</malay> I know where
and I have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
higher status <malay>kau</malay> manager your <malay>kau</malay> they treat me they treat us <malay>macam kita ni</malay> beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I <malay>aku macam</malay> to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day <malay>aku</malay>
have my own (uh) business or I I'm (uh) I'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever [lah] bigger title whatever
treating people nice is you is a must <malay>sebab</malay> how can you judge <malay>sebab</malay> I got people around me <malay>macam</malay> they they judge okay for example
<malay>kalau kau punya</malay> job (uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) cleaning wise <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
I mean you shouldn't judge
<malay>kau</malay> why would you (uh) I've seen this this is another topic (err) like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern [eh] I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because (uh) <malay>kita</malay> they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like (uh) <malay>kuli</malay> we are like beginner
<malay>kita macam baru masuk</malay> industry then they they they bully us they they not just (uh) okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment <malay>tapi</malay> if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like <malay>macam kita sampah</malay> or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like [oh] my god you you you you forget where you where you start you <malay>kau kau dah lupa diri</malay> [kan] this is what happen when <malay>kita lupa diri</malay> so I I I just want to advice myself that [oh] my god please
#nadia# don't ever <malay>lupa diri sebab</malay> one day <malay>kalau</malay> I get that extra money <malay>ke</malay> I get that extra title <malay>ke</malay> I might forget about myself and people below me
bad which I don't want that to happen and
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know <malay>bila</malay> this (uh) blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's (uh)
that's a wrap
