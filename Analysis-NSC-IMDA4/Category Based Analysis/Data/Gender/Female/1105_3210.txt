<malay>penat</malay> <malay>entah macam</malay> okay one of the reason [eh] <malay>sebab</malay> secondary school <malay>dengan</malay> primary school <malay>dah habis sekolah</malay> [tau] so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dah nak masuk</malay> holiday mindset <malay>aku dah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>abeh tapi</malay> poly <malay>masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>lagipun</malay> during this period [ah] the exams are like
the exams are like cut off about
<malay>nak kena apa jaga</malay> safe distancing [kan] so like the exams are out so most of our
exam are replaced with (err) graded assignments
so <malay>macam</malay> and most of the time [kan] my graded assignment <malay>semua kena buat</malay> report and for report confirm <malay>nak kena buat</malay> research <malay>banyak</malay>
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a <malay>banyak benda</malay> [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay> by the time <malay>dah habis sekolah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat</malay> and <malay>nak balik rumah</malay> one hour journey <malay>macam</malay> just the thought about it <malay>dah buat aku penat</malay> and when I came home
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday [ah] [ah]
I submit [lah] but it was like [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
half half <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> fifty percent <malay>punya</malay> reflection journal [a'ah] ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>abeh</malay> like
like you saw [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I just <malay>macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis</malay> !oi!
[eh] but your poly days <malay>macam lagi rabak</malay> because
you design [tau] like
like creativity like (err) <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
no because three point one is more of <malay>macam</malay> internship [tau] and these tuesday <malay>ada</malay> briefing on the internship [ah] and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it <malay>macam</malay> I don't know because <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> I don't know [eh] because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced <malay>kau macam</malay> put it in a beautiful way
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> just the thought of (um) having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
[ah]
(hmm)
(um)
but you know what (uh) I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean (err) ya it was at home so like but quite like <malay>mendak macam</malay> like (err) no (err) so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that <malay>yang</malay> assigned <malay>dia</malay> through
zoom or [ah] microsoft teams
[oh] she is (uh) in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
[ah] work from school even internship [eh] [ah] ya from home I mean
[ah] so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
I don't know [lah] <malay>dia tak</malay> elaborate [ah] but but yeah it was mostly a research
and like even but then right
<malay>dia datang</malay> for like one two days first two days [leh] then the period starts
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work [what]
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that [what]
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first [kan] orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like <malay>macam</malay> familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building <malay>tapi</malay> for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then (um)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so like and [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> like most of my <malay>kawan yang</malay> year ones
<malay>dorang</malay> like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the [ah] school <malay>punya</malay> website
so <malay>macam</malay>
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right [kan] so <malay>macam dorang macam</malay>
how am I supposed to <malay>berbual</malay> with this person <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
actually diff races okay [lah]
no [lah] I <malay>berbual</malay> english because by the time right for my batch <malay>dah banyak ada yang ambil</malay> tamil <malay>gini semua</malay>
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret <malay>masuk</malay> poly ya but
but I didn't regret <malay>masuk</malay> poly because like because certain things <malay>macam</malay> how
okay so <malay>aku macam</malay> old schools <malay>sikit</malay> computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how <malay>kental</malay> I am
ya so <malay>diam</malay> so [ah] so <malay>bila masuk</malay> poly <malay>tiba-tiba dah kena buat</malay> [ah] share document and all that then I was like <malay>apa ni apa ni</malay> I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like <malay>macam</malay>
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma [ah] outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
like I don't know I don't know [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if I think that <malay>macam</malay> [eh]
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like !huh! <malay>apa ni</malay> like what am I supposed to do there [ah] so <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] my god
<malay>kau tak bilang aku</malay>
[oh] you mean secondary school or what
[oh] primary five then I still in the kindergarten [lah]
no wonder <malay>kau selalu pergi</malay> library I thought it was to like to <malay>baca buku</malay> no
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay [ah]
since I'm already eighteen right so <malay>macam</malay> some some things that actually almost all of the things [kan] <malay>kau</malay> <malay>kat aku</malay>
but at that point of time I was
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa</malay> because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things <malay>daripada mami dan</malay> #abi# <malay>macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda</malay> everything first hand <malay>aku selalu dapat</malay> second or third hand <malay>aku macam</malay> I was kind of jealous at that point of time <malay>tapi</malay> that
I
<malay>macam dengar</malay> like what's like actually what happened actually so <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] not deserved [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
not deserve [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] deserve [lah] <malay>sikit</malay> deserve [lah]
messenger
<malay>macam</malay> messenger facebook
true [lah]
eighteen [oh] ya
(hmm)
[oh] secondary three secondary four okay so <malay>macam</malay>
okay firstly [kan] since [ah] okay so the teachers <malay>pun macam tahu</malay> [ah] like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates <malay>semua macam</malay> [ah] heck care <malay>macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni</malay> just it was that bad (uh) like even like teacher <malay>pun macam</malay> what
why is this class not like taking it seriously
<malay>tapi</malay> for me right
<malay>aku pun macam</malay>
why not have fun <malay>macam macam</malay> this is the last few days <malay>sebelum</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> like some <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> ya
not something to be like
a good memory [lah] so like our class <malay>macam</malay> quite
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like <malay>macam</malay> act <malay>serabak dorang</malay> [lah] like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
like absent for like out of five days [leh]
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
[ah] so <malay>macam</malay>
I had to do most of the things that <malay>macam</malay>
like attendance [ah] keep track of <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dah hantar</malay> acknowledgement slip or whatsoever [ah] so and most of the time even the teachers know that [ah]
(uh) ya so even the teachers know that [ah] anytime like they had to
<malay>macam tanya</malay> monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one <malay>yang akan</malay> represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
it was that bad so <malay>macam</malay> all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students [ah] twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious [lah]
like to be honest for me right
<malay>tak ada satu pun yang layak</malay>
<malay>tak ada satu pun</malay> [ah] <malay>terpaksa</malay> [ah] [ah]
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one [lah] the four years [lah] it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like <malay>kakak</malay> was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time (err) I don't know [leh] because [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like they most of the teacher point out [ah] like I am so different from you and <malay>abang</malay> ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what <malay>macam</malay> ya no matter what [ah]
<malay>aku akan</malay> avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like (err) for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then (um)
for that grade I got a
B three I don't want to tell you <malay>tak payah</malay> [ah] so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us <malay>dah macam</malay> go through many things so like and sec three sec four <malay>ada macam</malay> project <malay>macam masa tu ada</malay> this international is a <malay>apa</malay> humanitarian job [ah] so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising [lah] so like almost like everyday <malay>kita orang</malay> stay back and <malay>macam</malay> pop up <malay>macam</malay> this one booth <malay>kita orang jual air jual roti jual</malay> pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> and had a lot of fun [lah] then <malay>bila</malay> secondary four okay by the time secondary four <malay>semua orang dah tahu</malay> that is going to be the last year and this is the last time <malay>untuk macam</malay> rebel [ah] <malay>bukan</malay> rebel [ah] as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow [ah] <malay>macam</malay> and since <malay>kita orang dah tahu</malay> is our last year [kan] <malay>semua orang makin rapat</malay>
then (um)
and then so <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
even when <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the teachers like complain about us and then our class <malay>macam</malay> [ah] it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
<malay>macam</malay> this class <malay>macam</malay> !hais! this class like [ah] [ah]
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us (err) pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy (err) male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like [oh] my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like (err) on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear <malay>punya</malay> height
[eh] <malay>tak</malay> actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> everytime right I will like <malay>gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek</malay> then <malay>sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>geram</malay> [ah] but this kind of memories like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in (uh)
poly diploma in (uh) arabic private school so
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days <malay>macam</malay> it's just like
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
[oh] [oh] ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard [ah] vanguard
[oh]
[oh]
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
[ah] because for my primary school like
like they like
[ah] separate into our six six
A B C D E F [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class [ah]
but then like for the lower class right <malay>dorang</malay> like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing <malay>kesian juga macam</malay> like everyone <malay>akan tengok</malay> ya but then but the thing I hated the most because <malay>kita orang</malay> the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because <malay>kita orang macam macam</malay> [ah] okay [ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> apex camp no I am more of a person of <malay>yang tak suka</malay> interact <malay>bukan</malay> antisocial
I don't label myself as antisocial
<malay>cuma</malay> I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group [ah]
<malay>kau</malay> hold grudge [eh]
[oh] she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
[oh] [oh] okay okay
[oh] no
so means <malay>dorang</malay> stay back longer than <malay>kau</malay> stay back [ah]
[oh]
then issac was six
[oh] then why didn't you like <malay>cakap</malay> to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six <malay>punya kerja</malay>
[oh] primary six [oh] [oh] but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay
varsity jacket
[oh] that clip okay
so you had to like
[oh]
but did you realise everytime during camp or <malay>macam</malay> stay over <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
like most of us are <malay>macam tak tidur</malay>
[oh] <malay>korang tidur</malay> [eh]
[oh] no because for my batch right <malay>macam</malay> everytime <malay>kalau ada macam ada</malay> #qiyam# or <malay>macam macam</malay> sleep <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
<malay>selalu</malay> like <malay>malam</malay> [kan] <malay>kita orang tak tidur</malay>
and there was this one time it was the it was the guys [ah]
<malay>kita orang kita orang</malay> (uh) <malay>tidur dekat</malay> level three the boys <malay>tidur dekat</malay> level one but then [ah] #toa payoh#
I mean like canteen
[ah] okay so [ah] so but then <malay>kita orang dekat</malay> level three <malay>kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual</malay> [ah] with the girls [ah] <malay>kita orang berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> gossip something like that
so suddenly we saw someone running to the school gate
like <malay>dekat</malay> parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand <malay>kita orang macam</malay> curious [ah] like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning [oh] one [lah]

it was a punishment
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly <malay>tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari</malay> to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did [ah] but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like <malay>tak tidur</malay> so the rest <malay>kena</malay> punishment but then right I think the male teachers like <malay>macam</malay>
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep <malay>macam tak terganggu</malay> with any check
[oh] ya
like quite
creepy <malay>keras</malay>
