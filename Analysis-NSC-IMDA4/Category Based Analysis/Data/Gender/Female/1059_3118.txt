so basically (um)
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and (err) so (err)
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything [lah] about his life so
true enough [lah] he is a very (uh) forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an (uh) up point for him [lah] you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
number one (err) it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very <malay>macam</malay> like (uh) <malay>abang</malay> why you asking for my name no [ah] upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in (err)
#changi# airport
(um)
and that #changi# airport is what we thought it was [lah] to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why [lah] but of course there's that connotation [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> it's not it's not really
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it [lah]
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then (um) so now he is (uh) working at (uh) #novena# and he is there because (uh) he wants to do office work and rightfully so [lah] because he wants to (uh) spend more time [lah] with your family
(uh) and
since he has going to move towards
getting married (uh) he thought this the right step [ah] as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound [lah] in why he's doing it okay then he talk about (um)
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay [ah] this one [ah] [oh] every time I do as in [ah] like
was it so difficult to [ah] get this out
so [ah] <malay>dia suka dia suka</malay> in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here <malay>abah</malay> was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got #zina# to sit right beside me
the mirror the mirror side
[ah] middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so [ah] what else (um) okay so I I
[ah] that one I didn't get to ask but that one is <malay>tak tak important [lah] ya
so the other [ah] important part was about his job experience [lah] so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain [lah] actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he <malay>apa</malay> the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
[ah] okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
[ah] that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
[ah]
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact (uh) do you have connect plan that's he look at me like (uh) what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years [oh] we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said [lah] ya [ah] six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and [ah] okay
<malay>apa yang susah sangat</malay>
that's why exactly that's why I say
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and <malay>abah</malay> were very calm about it <malay>tak ada macam</malay> problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that [eh]
[ah] so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was [ah] number one [ah] <malay>apa</malay> there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then <malay>dia tinggal</malay> #pasir ris#
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale [lah] because they want to look for some a place near (err) <malay>istighfar</malay>
because <malay>dekat</malay> (um) the parents place #pasir ris#
ya [lah] but I don't know why they want that place [lah] anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
this is this could have been <malay>boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] [kan] which is to
<malay>bilang</malay> [kan] that you want to (um) do this to both your parents and #zina's# parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that (err) the keys you know then what you have to actually this part <malay>abah</malay> was the one who [ah] already point out I just reiterated the point
<malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>macam terdesak</malay> [kan] you have to like actually have to push for this [ah] then you are making it difficult for both sides
[ah] then he just he just nodded [lah] he he understood (uh) but I was still <malay>macam</malay> thinking [eh] do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here [ah] but I think it's in between [lah] it's in between that apologetic but also <malay>macam</malay> like okay
[ah] he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel [what] <malay>begitu</malay> I say it's not about that [lah] it's about you informing do it properly
correct ya
so (um) ya so that that part they understood [lah] you know what it's it's spilt milk ready [lah] [kan] like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
[ah] then I then I also talk to them [lah] like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan <malay>abah</malay> also want to hear what is his <malay>apa dia punya rancangan</malay> [lah]
(um) then it was very clear <malay>rancangan</malay> is that
the next year somewhere <malay>dalam</malay> march they intend to <malay>tunang dengan zina</malay>
and then
that's why [lah]
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk #zina# whenever #zina# butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then (err)
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet <malay>abah</malay> probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement [lah]
the <malay>nikah</malay> would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] revise plan [ah] [ah] correct
[ah] I also don't want to embarrass [lah] #zina# cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing #zina# session but no point [lah] the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
[ah] then okay then at least say that gives proper time [lah] for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the <malay>abah</malay> was saying you know #zina# just got
(err) just finish studying <malay>jadi apa</malay> the plan in these two years for for her (uh) then this #azram# <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] ya (uh) this is to would be
for #zina# to actually [ah] secure a job
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about <malay>macam</malay> like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me #zina# also needs to work to build up a
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows [lah] that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why <malay>macam</malay> it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple <malay>tak payah tak ada</malay> complication
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working [lah] and you #zena# needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience #zena# hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for #zina# to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children [ah] then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
[ah] that one okay [lah] they bring about the halal thing [lah] so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya #zina# needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
and I and I <malay>pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] that
you
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
grow up
<malay>dia zina pun nak kena</malay> grow up
<malay>asing asing asing masing-masing kena</malay> grow up <malay>tersendiri</malay>
<malay>lepas itu</malay>
grew up together
[ah] so you need give that time <malay>untuk</malay> you both <malay>nak kena</malay> grow up [ah] that's the thing <malay>budak itu diam</malay> [jer] so I <malay>tak puas hati</malay> because like you can just be numb about this whole thing [lah] that is a which is (uh) quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that <malay>abah</malay> is there something you want to (uh) anything you want to ask them (uh) I said ya so [ah] let me check in (um) so
#ashraf# you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
so one thing that I brought out is you both <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>tersendiri</malay> grow
and then
[ah] come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
[ah] then they say
okay for me I (uh) I feel that
<malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>nak kena apa ada</malay> this (uh)
grow up right <malay>memang nak kena ada</malay> grow up <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) growing up needs to needs <malay>perlu berada dalam</malay>
[ah] context <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dari sendiri sebelum kahwin dan selepas kahwin</malay>
<malay>maksud dia</malay> has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
so it's like if he [lah] in the sense that [ah] so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that (uh) growing up takes place both [lah] during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this [ah] so I made it very clear that don't just lip service <malay>dia perlu perbincangan</malay> further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate <malay>abah dengar ini tak mahu</malay> communicate communicate like <malay>tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa</malay> <malay>abah</malay> there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so (um) I think they got it [lah] so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
then after the whole session also I told #zina# and even just now I texted saying that
<malay>kau orang nak kena</malay> sit down <malay>nak kena</malay> plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say [ah] ya [lah] grow grow grow but you just gonna
<malay>tak</malay> work on it you just gonna <malay>macam letak kat tepi</malay> [jer] and just <malay>macam</malay> put it into the back of your mind <malay>tak nak macam</malay>
<malay>apa buat kerja</malay> develop this it's not gonna work
so
of course [lah]
of course I'm not <malay>macam</malay> blind to this [ah]
(mmhmm)
because at the end <malay>itu</malay> mama <malay>dekat</malay> kitchen and (mm) mama <malay>malu malu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti bila kita duduk makan baru</malay> mama <malay>duduk</malay>
anyway I
<malay>dayah tak ada dayah</malay> said she doesn't want to be there also [lah]
so (mm) ya then I told him okay #ashraf# after all that's been said [ah] I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya [lah] I said you have
I didn't say <malay>sembunyi-sembunyi</malay> [lah] I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
(mm)
then
(um) so basically that's it [lah] and then
at least it's it's clear [lah] that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
body gesture and how he interact with #zina# he is very firm he's just firm [lah] it's that not say very firm [lah] but it's firm <malay>macam</malay> whatever <malay>zina macam nak nak tanya</malay> [ah] #ashraf# right do you want water then he will just say
no he will just use
very <malay>macam</malay> he won't just he won't say [oh] it's okay #zina# he he won't
(mm) like
so I can see [ah] and the way he speaks also is <malay>macam</malay> very direct and very
(mm) ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage [lah]
ya
so
ya
ya so it's not <malay>macam</malay> so as as ambiguous as it was [lah] at least it's kind of <malay>macam</malay> very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to [ah] give #zina# time to work [ah] give #zina# time to develop
<malay>kita tak tanya pasal dia punya</malay> family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
sister is working as a librarian but at #changi#
#changi# business <malay>apa</malay> #changi# [ah] ya that one ya that one warehouse [lah] ya so
ya so it's was very easy [lah] then after when he left also I was telling [lah] see how easy and simple #ashraf#
was
by just being upfront
<malay>dia macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> I I don't know that
no #zina# you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
so <malay>jadi macam</malay>
ya [lah] so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
then <malay>abah abah</malay> is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that <malay>abah</malay> like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay <malay>abah</malay> is comfortable with him already
ya so
like my [ah] that's why it was very simple [lah] because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that [lah] [kan]
so and he also can recognize [lah] the value in it and can recognise why you know #zina# needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that #zina# needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time #zina# would be the one taking care of it
#ashraf# [ah] because (uh)
someone needs to be there at home [lah] he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or #zina's# parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working [lah] and then I then I ask him so (uh) are you exploring the possibility of #zina# working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
[ah] that's something that they will have to <malay>macam</malay> resolve [lah] how but at the very least they are giving #zina# time to grow
(um)
okay [lor] then after then the
in the dining
(uh)
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear [lah] clear and upfront
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been [ah] <malay>apa</malay> been attached to for the three months
[ah] it was okay normal not not that <malay>macam</malay> overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that [ah] the past (uh) he has yet to have the chance to go for <malay>jumaat</malay> players
ever since COVID like <malay>macam</malay> basically he's just trying to share [lah] like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like <malay>macam</malay> he just brought up we were talking about <malay>jumaat</malay> prayers and then we were sharing
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
ya <malay>tak payah macam pening-pening sangat</malay>
[ah] actually after that was a lot more interest <malay>lepas itu lagi</malay> interesting
for example
(um)
was <malay>abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir</malay> [ah] <malay>ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah</malay>
<malay>ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik</malay>
<malay>tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena</malay> [kan] then I said <malay>abah</malay>
<malay>abah nak kena tengok</malay> [eh]
#hidayah# okay you you got two different daughters <malay>abah cakap apa</malay> different both are daughter yes both are your daughters <malay>tapi</malay> there are two different girls two different daughters
okay
#zina# is on the receiving end she is <malay>zina sudah memang nak menerima</malay>
<malay>apa berkahwin hidayah</malay> I don't think she is there yet <malay>dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu</malay>
<malay>pasal apa</malay>
then <malay>zina pun</malay> add in [ah] ya but she says she wants to get married ya <malay>memang dia nak tapi</malay> is she proactive looking no [what] she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors (uh)
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
!huh!
then (uh) then I said so <malay>abah</malay> you need to understand <malay>yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan</malay>
#zina# is receiving #dayah# is not there yet
so <malay>abah kena</malay> recognize that and #dayah# is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say <malay>abah macam habis kita</malay> then I say okay yes I know I I <malay>faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana</malay> now <malay>bila habis sampai bila abah kata</malay>
then <malay>abah</malay> let me give you some advice
if you <malay>nak di</malay> to even
<malay>dijalankan</malay>
<malay>abah (err) mama <malay>bila nak</malay>
<malay>calonkan</malay> or <malay>menunjukkan calon</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> quality
<malay>biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada</malay> quality <malay>dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik</malay> of course <malay>sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam</malay> give up <malay>dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah</malay> just throw [jer] ya then mama say <malay>tapi</malay> the one <malay>yang dekat</malay> australia <malay>itu abah mama tahu tak</malay> he is just a taxi driver then #dayah# will think <malay>macam macam bingit</malay> [lah]
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working [ah] [ah]
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
because he actually (err) <malay>apa</malay> he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to <malay>sewakan rumah ini</malay> so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
#dayah# at is at this stage of her life
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang aku cakap</malay>
that's why I say <malay>cari orang berkualiti berkualiti</malay> is not just about
(mm)
(mm) so we don't know that [lah] !huh!
ya so anyway <malay>jadi macam</malay>
<malay>abah</malay> understood that [lah] I said <malay>abah tak boleh</malay> control <malay>apa dayah nak ini</malay>
<malay>abah boleh</malay> control <malay>kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh</malay> control <malay>itu itu yang abah boleh</malay> control
so I said right now it seem that <malay>dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan</malay> fine <malay>tapi cari berkualiti</malay> this if people are not are <malay>ada</malay> quality and I said <malay>pada abah</malay> it's not about social status it's not about <malay>macam kaya tak kaya</malay> ya it's about the <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match [ah]
basically this this guy ya
<malay>jadi budak ini dengan dayah</malay> are two different people so cannot
that's why
so [oh] anyway going back to #zina# I I told #zina# like
you need to sit down and you really need to (uh)
figure out the plan on how you gonna
<malay>buat apa memperbaiki diri sendiri</malay>
then <malay>membina diri sendiri</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina</malay>
<malay>bersama</malay>
<malay>jangan cakap saja</malay>
plan it out
<malay>tak boleh zina cakap</malay> [ah] ya ya okay I will look at it [lah] <malay>abang</malay> ya
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>cakap abang</malay> [lah] okay
fair enough [lah] if he (uh) considered (um)
cause he then I say (uh) I
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said [oh] I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know (uh) <malay>semalam</malay> that (err) you you are #ashraf# then I was thinking okay how is it <malay>macam mana dia akan menerima ini</malay> [ah] <malay>cara</malay> [eh]
<malay>zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku</malay> like
<malay>nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama</malay> I don't know [lah] but then <malay>lepas itu dia tanya</malay> (err) <malay>abang</malay> your name is #salim# is it [ah] yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me <malay>abang</malay> [ah] like if <malay>macam dia</malay> #satay# <malay>ada banyak</malay> ya then <malay>abang</malay> also can bring back the
so I thought (err) ya that's why it was easy [lah] <malay>macam abang pun cakap</malay> and because like I said
I told #ashraf# that I'm appreciative <malay>yang dia terus terang dia</malay>
<malay>ada apa ada wawasan</malay> [lah] [ah]
<malay>lepas itu abang pun cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak</malay> clear [ah] <malay>habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini</malay>
(uh)
<malay>encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] I thought <malay>macam</malay> the
<malay>macam mana</malay> it went through was good [lah] ya
[ah] #azlina# #azlina# need to <malay>macam</malay> grow up [lah] on this
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how #ashraf# is
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're <malay>macam</malay> like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has [lah] correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what #ashraf# has did did you see or not how #ashraf# did it
I told her [lah] did you see or not what #ashraf# did
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront <malay>tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi</malay>
[kan] daddy <malay>cerita senang</malay> then I say isn't it simple so that <malay>macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru</malay>
[ah] you just have to be upfront [jer] [kan] <malay>senang</malay> and ya [lah] ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
ya
that's why [lah] she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as [oh]
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
#zina# that is not easy-going
(mm)
<malay>aku cakap dengan dia yang</malay> easy-going <malay>dengan</malay> being firm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going [what]
you are not (um) having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
(mm)
that's why during the
during the discussion <malay>dengan ashraf</malay> I was saying #zina#
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study (mm) [ah] <malay>ashraf dengar</malay> [jer] [lah] what he want to say he just (mm) (mm)
that's why #ashraf#
if
(mm) but whatever it is he is already <malay>macam</malay> he never <malay>macam</malay> like show the reaction of <malay>macam</malay> you know or he didn't show it [lah] of being <malay>tak nak tak nak apa</malay> [oh] like shock or what I think he knows [ah] what he's getting into with #zina#
the way
ya [lah] of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya [lah] I agree of course that's why I said they both <malay>tersendiri nak kena</malay> grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed <malay>tersendiri</malay>
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent [lah]
<malay>dia</malay>
I don't think he would [lah] if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
if if <malay>kalau izat buat gitu</malay> then I will tell him off [lah] [eh] <malay>kau kenal dia ke tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa</malay> so we have to be we have to take this step <malay>kita kena (uh) <malay>apa kita mesti</malay>
(err)
<malay>ambil</malay> (uh)
<malay>kegiatan begini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak boleh macam apa ambil</malay> scenario [jer]
push #zina# right
pull
pull
ya
consume
I <malay>faham</malay>
step up
no [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan</malay> no
(mm)
so ya basically concludes the whole thing [lah] with
#zina# and #ashraf# then
I was two zero <malay>abah</malay> open this topic about #dayah# then I was asking #zina# #zina# what have you been talking to #dayah# [lah] about #dayah's# like (err) relationship or [a'ah] <malay>zina cakap</malay> no we don't talk each other !huh!
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya #dayah# and me then ya I understand that you and #dayah# are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what #hidayah# is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
<malay>sekarang dua-dua sudah</malay> try [kan]
<malay>dua-dua sudah</malay> try
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so you tell me <malay>apa nak kena buat sekarang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>nak buat apa sekarang</malay> then <malay>dia sudah</malay> [ah] ya try again [lah] try no
<malay>sudah</malay> try <malay>sudah sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so nak <malay>kena buat apa</malay>
do what you want me to tell you the answer <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] I have to give you the answer
!huh!
why you must have the <malay>jawapan</malay> for me
I want to hear from your own <malay>mulut</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> ya then <malay>kita nak kena</malay> ask someone to help [ah] then <malay>siapa</malay> this someone to help
you [lah] [ah] then
<malay>kenapa</malay> it has to be me to ask you to
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
you know <malay>abang salim kita ada</malay> problem
okay just kind of <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
see things eye to eye <malay>tak boleh macam bersefahaman</malay>
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why <malay>zina kalau</malay> if this were the reverse that let's say you and #zina# you and #dayah#
I had the same kind of argument with me and #izat# I bet you [ah] you and #dayah# would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least [ah] you see [ah] it me and #izat#
<malay>macam mana pun</malay> that has happen [ah] #izat# would still come and apologize to me
I'm doubting you know whether you and #dayah# would apologise to each other
then you did #zina# was saying <malay>macam</malay> like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to #izat#
<malay>macam</malay> like life [lah] about children about
<malay>apa</malay> marriage like that that
ya ya
[lah] <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like how how he (uh) <malay>apa</malay> decided to get married with with #salimah# then ya we have ya before even during during <malay>apa</malay>
during [ah] our <malay>apa</malay> being after being married also we still talk about <malay>macam</malay> certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not <malay>macam</malay> pen pals is not like <malay>macam</malay> like the way I would talk to #faris# for example but
<malay>macam</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> things things about personal things I still can talk to him <malay>macam</malay> I can easily talk to him <malay>macam</malay> [eh] #izat# <malay>kau tengok macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam dayah</malay> is like I I can have the conversation with #izat# you know ya I can but <malay>macam</malay>
#dayah# and #zina# will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that <malay>macam</malay>
that's why [lah] that's why it seems it's
ya [lah]
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
no [lah] not really enstranged like even after this one I I have <malay>macam</malay> move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise <malay>dulu lagi tak boleh</malay> apologise <malay>pun dia punya</malay> ego is so big
what the
like have to see it as steps [lah]
so
that I mean like
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to <malay>macam</malay> make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms #hidayah# and #zina# is different they are just happy with being ignored
<malay>dayah zina sudah</malay> give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring #hidiyah#
that's how bad it is [ah] so at least me and <malay>izat kalau kita</malay> disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like <malay>izat macam</malay> has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that <malay>macam</malay> he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>tak nak berbual dengan si salim</malay> no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
how he <malay>macam</malay> best character he needs to learn to work it out
so okay [lah] I think
<malay>kita semua memang</malay> have your own areas of growth but
#dayah# and #zina# is like they just ignore the problem then I say #zina# especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen <malay>nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi kau orang lagi</malay> will be more separated
I can tell that me and #izat# even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
you and #dayah# ready have a problem <malay>bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi</malay> what do you think
this passive aggressiveness <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay> [ah]
and not just <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay> no it's not <malay>tak apa</malay>
(uh huh)
ya I I did I did <malay>macam</malay> tell her [lah] that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that (uh)
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>fikir</malay> how
this is important this <malay>memang mustahak</malay>
that family comes first
that you need to see that
you cannot just <malay>macam biarkan</malay> that this issue (err) to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya [lah] so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
<malay>bersetuju tak</malay>
<malay>nak abang salim tolong</malay>
[ah] first you have to you <malay>setuju</malay> if you <malay>setuju</malay>
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask <malay>hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak</malay> then
we will make it happen
<malay>jadi</malay> it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem <malay>masalah yang dia ada ini</malay> is trust issues #hidayah# doesn't trust her because #hidayah# feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what #zina# has trust issues because things #dayah# is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you [ah] so that's why [lah] trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts [ah] so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] it's just not healthy and you cannot just
<malay>biarkan macam gitu</malay> [jer]
yes so I
mama <malay>abah</malay> just listen so good thing was
mama <malay>abah</malay> willing to hear
and then
mama !wah! at one okay at one point
(mm) <malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
nevermind just (mm)
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like (um) there was one point where (um)
#zina# was (uh) no I (uh) #zina# was saying that she was (um) the reason why <malay>apa</malay> she went on to telling #izat# first because she felt more comfortable talking to #izat#
then I said #zina# since when you are that close to #izat# then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to #izat# then I say rubbish [lah]
then she she <malay>sudah bingit</malay> [lah] <malay>bila kena</malay> rubbish then she walk off
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
she she <malay>kena</malay> already [lah] then she walk off
so that's why I told her ya #zina# you are close to #izat# because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to #izat#
#izat# is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct [ah] but I say you are close to the boys just because of (uh)
(uh) you are close to #izat# just because the boys (uh) with #izat# you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to #izat#
then I say since when you been talking to #izat# since when
all all the
then say ya of recent years it has been the case [ah] that's that's the part I said [ah] rubbish then stop it since when then she already <malay>sudah kena</malay> then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>mana !wah! you are the
you are that close to #izat# then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys [kan]
further studies
[ah] then I then I also
so going back to <malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] we were talking about #zina# and #dayah# and I was asking #zina# who do you think you
need this person the person [ah] to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what #izat# can do this job [ah]
[ah] then #izat# do you think then she's like smile [ah] !aiya! [lah] cannot [lah]
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
(mm) that's why
<malay>jadi sebab dia kena tengok</malay> and understand that this is the situation
(hmm)
<malay>jadi macam bila dayah</malay>
and #zina# sit down together then they can iron this out [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward [one] really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
they just don't see the point in <malay>macam</malay> making sure that they are
you know comfortable
ya of course
true [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh macam</malay> just simply you know say that [oh] this is a one time deal <malay>mesti</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ingat</malay>
ya so obviously it takes steps [lah] it's not <malay>macam</malay> I one time can <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
<malay>apa terus langsung</malay>
