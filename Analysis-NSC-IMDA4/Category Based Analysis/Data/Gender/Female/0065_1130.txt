and it turns out to be some insurance company
no it's not is is like you know
ya they they're basically trying to sell insurance
ya exactly and I didn't know that I thought it was just some fitness like workout healthy health program something like that
he probably doesn't know ya that's why
so they called me just now to have a meeting
like
no because I was reading up the the vitality membership thing then I thought it was quite interesting so I was like okay okay sure like okay I'll just I'll just go agree whatever and then they scheduled for the meeting today just now
then I just I just went like I just attended the meeting [ah] and then after that they like the the
the membership the program itself is like it's quite interesting you need to like you only have to clock in ten thousand steps a day like for five days out of seven days a week and then you get like cashback you get like vouchers and stuff like that which I thought was pretty cool
but then after that they started asking me about my savings
like they started to ask me like (err) are you are you a a thrifty spender like how do you save your monthly allowance like when do you receive your allowance when they kind of thing and then
I was like [oh] this one confirm want to sell insurance right and then I just like [oh] then I just answered their questions and then after that ya they asked me if I was interested in a savings (err) savings plan with them

when you deposit money [lah] whatever you know you get the interest returns right like how many percentage per annum that kind of thing
so they are trying to like like coerce you [ah] okay like you know like it's so
like for example (um) per annum is I think zero point zero five or something like that but then they're offering three to four percent
which is actually a lot [lah] and it's like when they showed me the like they they generated the (err) returns and like the the sum assured and stuff like that and then I saw the paper and everything and then like [eh] can earn big bucks [sia] actually from this but it's not an investment it's just a savings plan
but ya ya they give you interest
