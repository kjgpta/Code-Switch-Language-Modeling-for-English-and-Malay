captain marvel I know that captain marvel is a lady [lah] but (uh) actually <malay>kalau</malay> you can make it into a man <malay>punya</malay> character <malay>pun bagus juga</malay>
so it's basically the strongest avengers in all the avengers even thanos <malay>pun kalah</malay> okay there's one more is I like to be the witch [ah] a witch
from also from avengers <malay>kenapa</malay>
cause <malay>yang</malay> time <malay>kita tengok</malay> end games <malay>tu</malay> actually <malay>kalau</malay>

even your body <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi macam</malay> bodybuilder have a small physique [lah] <malay>kirakan angan badan besar-besar sangat</malay>
not that good
meal [eh]
meal <malay>tu apa makan apa-apa</malay> [ah]
[oh] overseas okay I got one that I remember
[ah] until now I <malay>pernah makan</malay>
whale meat when I go to japan
<malay>itu</malay> that is very memorable <malay>apasal</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> whale meat <malay>yang paling mahal sekali</malay>
actually <malay>dia punya</malay> whale meat <malay>dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis</malay> [jer] <malay>dia potong</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan</malay> #ramen# #ramen#
<malay>dia punya</malay> japanese version <malay>punya</malay> #ramen# [lah] then <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>selepas tu</malay> first I thought <malay>macam dia punya</malay> <malay>dia punya</malay> portion <malay>dia</malay> is quite big [tau] <malay>besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih</malay> too little
[oh] it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause (uh) it's not #sashimi# usually <malay>orang jepun kalau kasih</malay> #sashimi# <malay>dia akan letak dekat</malay> a different plate
but this one is cooked (uh) but not like deep fry <malay>punya</malay> cook [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think steam or what [lah] cause
<malay>dia letak</malay> on top of the #ramen# itself so we must eat along on the #ramen# <malay>dengan dia punya</malay>
condiments [ah] basically <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> seaweed <malay>semua</malay> [lah]
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually (um) the most unique [lah] <malay>paling</malay> unique <malay>sekali</malay> and <malay>dia punya</malay>
restaurant is actually located outside #meiji# shrine [ah] <malay>yang pasal halal</malay>
<malay>tak halal tu</malay> actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese <malay>punya</malay>
restaurant [kan] once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>babi</malay> or any (uh) meat stuff [lah] even <malay>ayam ke daging ke apa</malay> so once they sell <malay>barang</malay>
seafood is purely hundred percent just <malay>barang</malay> seafood [jer]
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
okay okay <malay>yang itu paling</malay> best okay <malay>yang dia punya</malay> whale <malay>bila makan</malay> it's [eh] <malay>dia punya potong</malay> slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
[lah] put inside my mouth it just melts <malay>dia kira macam makan</malay> butter <malay>gitu cuma rasa dia</malay> is <malay>bukan</malay> butter <malay>rasa dia</malay> is <malay>lemak tapi bukan lemak macam</malay>
<malay>kambing ke lemak</malay> [ah] no [tau] it's just <malay>lemak</malay>
but you just taste the sea water so <malay>kirakan</malay>
<malay>dia rasa betul-betul macam</malay>
<malay>lemak ikan</malay> and whale <malay>punya lemak</malay> is really one of a kind [ah] it's really !wah! if
the taste is really unique [lah]
<malay>kalau awak pernah makan</malay> <malay>macam</malay> sea urchin <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat <malay>itu itu yang</malay> very very very unique
<malay>yang orang tak pernah rasa</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak pasti isi</malay> or fats
but (uh) mostly it's I think fats [ah] cause <malay>kalau isi</malay> whale [kan] is a tough [kan]
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats <malay>yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut</malay> even fats <malay>kambing</malay>
<malay>ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti</malay> melts in the mouth
[ah] so that is the thing and <malay>lagipun dia punya</malay> I think <malay>dia potong tipis-tipis</malay> [lah] so I can't really
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best [eh]
actually <malay>takde yang</malay> okay compare japan korea [lah] <malay>kita jangan cakap pasal</malay> thailand
thailand is <malay>dia punya makan</malay> just <malay>semuanya pedas-pedas</malay> [jer]
(uh) japan <malay>boleh tahan</malay> (uh) but japan <malay>punya makan</malay> is <malay>betul-betul</malay>
<malay>bukan tekak orang melayu</malay>
<malay>yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu</malay> is you know what (um) <malay>makanan</malay> korea
cause <malay>makanan</malay> korea even <malay>dia punya mee hitam tu yang</malay>
<malay>orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa</malay> exactly the same as <malay>kita punya mee rebus</malay>
yes #jajangmyeon# cause <malay>kita punya mee rebus semua</malay> the difference is #jajangmyeon# is <malay>macam dia macam basah-basah</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa</malay> exactly the same <malay>macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah</malay> and of course <malay>kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap</malay> cause why <malay>kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi</malay>
and <malay>ada telur ada apa</malay> so <malay>dia orang punya</malay> is a mixture of japanese
<malay>punya</malay> taste bud <malay>dengan</malay> mix with into <malay>mee rebus punya rasa</malay> that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique [lah] quite unique <malay>tapi yang</malay> I really like about korea is <malay>dia punya daging</malay> #bulgogi#
<malay>itu</malay> I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner <malay>dia punya daging</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas</malay> enough <malay>ialah cukup</malay>
cause <malay>pasal pasal daging</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>tu</malay> you imagine <malay>macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan</malay>
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate !fuh! <malay>lepas tu makan dengan nasi</malay>
<malay>nasi biasa nasi panas-panas</malay> [eh] steam rice <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>sedap</malay> you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you <malay>takkan rasa jelak</malay> I mean according to my taste [lah] cause I really like the <malay>daging</malay> #bulgogi#
to that extreme yes
yes I've tried #wagyu# beef <malay>yang halal punya</malay> actually we have
until <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) A three <malay>ke</malay> A two usually <malay>halal punya</malay> #wagyu# beef there's no A five <malay>yang tak halal punya iya yang</malay> A five cause (um)
<malay>yang halal punya</malay> is actually (err) it's only made in australia
<malay>yang</malay> the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself [lah] <malay>yang halal punya</malay> is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five <malay>punya punya apa tu punya punya</malay> grading
[ah]
no the #wagyu# beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
the the #wagyu# beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan <malay>yang yang</malay> [ah]
<malay>lembu-lembu ni yang ada itu</malay>
the essence of #wagyu# beef [ah] <malay>yang banyak</malay> marbling it's also I heard there's also a
a special kind of breed only for
for the #wagyu# beef <malay>punya itu</malay> [ah] market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five <malay>yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya</malay> the rest of it is a usually (um)
<malay>tak</malay> (uh) no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia <malay>punya</malay> is (uh) <malay>dia punya</malay> grade not that high [lah] but <malay>dia punya rasa</malay> okay [lah] actually okay [lah] the thing about
(uh) #wagyu# beef is just that <malay>dia punya lemak</malay> [jer]
<malay>yang</malay> if you if you really notice [kan] <malay>dia punya yang urat-urat tu</malay> is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the <malay>lemak</malay> fats is the same
what makes it different is that <malay>orang jepun ni dia punya</malay> #wagyu# beef <malay>dia suka potong</malay> raw
<malay>makan macam apa tu</malay> the #sashimi# [eh] then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that #umami# effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
<malay>ada itu</malay> #umami# <malay>punya</malay> effect #umami# effect is exactly like how you
eat <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
#ajinomoto# <malay>dia</malay> that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the #wagyu# beef
(uh) <malay>dia punya lemak-lemak dia</malay>
ya
[oh] like I say just now [lah] I only eat #bulgogi# cause that's to me is the best of the best <malay>paling sedap</malay>
the #bulgogi# is really my got to [lah] I've eaten <malay>orang makan</malay> thailand <malay>makan</malay> indonesia <malay>melayu semua</malay> I just like #bulgogi# cause #bulgogi# <malay>pun kira macam-macam</malay> [tau] a different part of korea <malay>yang halal punya</malay> they make different type of #bulgogi# the one that I really like is the <malay>budak-budak yang bikin kat</malay>
#itaewon# the #itaewon# actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain [ah] it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up (err) that hill
that hill <malay>daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua</malay>
<malay>makanan halal</malay> from singapore from malaysia
turkey <malay>negeri</malay> arab <malay>semua ada</malay> so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque <malay>nama dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>tak apa-apa nama dia</malay> is is not it's a <malay>adalah</malay> I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
then after that if you go down
okay cause <malay>dia pun macam</malay> road [kan] so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small <malay>macam</malay>
(err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] you know like those kind of arab street <malay>punya</malay> shophouses you go [ah]
<malay>macam gitu</malay> you go then <malay>adalah dekat situ</malay> [ah] actually <malay>yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu</malay>
they are malaysians but the way they cook the #bulgogi# is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the #bulgogi#
a lot of them and also there are other specialty [kan] it's actually <malay>ayam rebus</malay> and <malay>dia punya ayam</malay> it's actually they take the whole
<malay>macam</malay> spring chicken <malay>dia kasih</malay> steam <malay>itu benda</malay>
and <malay>dia rebus kat dalam</malay> the chicken soup the chicken broth !wah! then they they just [ah] basically
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
<malay>dia tak potong tak apa</malay> the steamed chicken <malay>tu</malay> they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
[ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> one bowl of rice
!fuh! <malay>makan sedap</malay> [ah] actually during winter <malay>makan tu</malay> is the best [ah]
cause I go it's actually
not really winter [lah] it's quite cold but not really winter <malay>yang</malay> I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
<malay>dalam</malay> minus
twelve [ah] minus twelve <malay>yang paling sejuk</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu yang paling</malay> best [kan] <malay>kat</malay> japan on the new year's day new year's day <malay>pagi-pagi bangun</malay>
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal [lah] I I actually go down
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean <malay>dia punya</malay> snow <malay>dia punya</malay> snow is <malay>tak banyak</malay> must wait for the night time then we go to the
nearest park then that's where all the snow is [lah]
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> you go cause #tokyo# [kan] is <malay>bandar</malay> [kan] so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields <malay>dekat yang pokok-pokok</malay> [ah] then you can take the snow from there
very interesting
(err) truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore <malay>punya</malay> weather cause singapore <malay>punya</malay> weather you can only expect two
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
<malay>punya</malay> weather [lah] like (uh) autumn
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> spring [lah] winter
cause why for I mean for own
livelihood [lah] I mean <malay>tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah</malay> <malay>berapa besar</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah</malay> <malay>kita</malay> then <malay>lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk</malay> weather singapore <malay>sendiri dah</malay>
<malay>dah banyak apa lagi kalau</malay> imagine <malay>kita kena simpan</malay> for
winter clothings <malay>lain</malay>
autumn clothings <malay>lain</malay>
spring clothings <malay>lain</malay> summer clothings <malay>lain</malay> so we will [ah] take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal [lah] that is for me [lah] but unless it's [ah] you are
talking about we are living in japan <malay>negeri dia besar</malay> even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there <malay>dia punya rumah sana</malay>
<malay>murah-murah</malay> and actually it's freehold [tau] it's not <malay>macam kita</malay> lease
ninety nine years is freehold <malay>rumah dia</malay> is actually very affordable
<malay>kita punya rumah</malay> three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized <malay>punya rumah</malay> in japan freehold
and !wah! I tell you the
<malay>punya</malay> scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area <malay>macam kita punya</malay>
<malay>tempat</malay> [lah] #hougang# #ang mo kio#
<malay>kita punya</malay> you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right <malay>kalau dekat jepun</malay> you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban [ah] it's <malay>macam dia punya</malay> heartland [ah] <malay>kira</malay>
is all <malay>rumah dia</malay> is all (uh) <malay>rumah</malay> bungalow bungalow bungalow
<malay>lepas tu yang ada tempat ada</malay> gate <malay>yang ada tempat tak ada</malay> gate but mostly <malay>tempat dia orang</malay> is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
okay in japan [kan] in a middle of
<malay>dia punya</malay> village <malay>dia</malay> is actually a farm
<malay>dia akan</malay> farm is actually <malay>itu</malay> farm <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>jepun punya beras</malay> [kan] <malay>lain</malay> [kan] so basically all the villagers <malay>dia akan</malay> (um)
<malay>apa tu</malay> have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right [ah] until modernization come [lah] but that farm itself right <malay>untuk kalau</malay>
<malay>nasi</malay> basic <malay>punya nasi</malay> is actually more than enough to feed the whole
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of [lah]
so even until now also there are still people but not young people [lah] the old people [ah] <malay>dia orang tua-tua yang</malay> [ah] mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right (um) <malay>yang paling</malay> best <malay>kita orang</malay> tourist they let they let us enter
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive [lah] but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
cause <malay>dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english <malay>yang</malay>
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english <malay>pun</malay> is actually
broken english it's not really full (uh) <malay>punya</malay> english the language that we learn (um) from our
school [lah] cause (err) frankly speaking in asia right
[oh] <malay>budak-budak</malay> singapore <malay>kita punya</malay> english is one of the highest grade [lah] <malay>kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa</malay> english in all of asian <malay>punya</malay> country even if you go to like
russia even china you know <malay>apatah lagi</malay> malaysia indonesia <malay>ni semua</malay> their english level <malay>dengan budak</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> level
is really <malay>macam langit dengan bumi lain</malay>
really far [kan]
[ah] so that is the gist [lah] actually
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> for japan <malay>tak</malay> (uh) it depends on where you go <malay>kalau itu tempat</malay> is <malay>betul-betul</malay> hundred percent muslims okay usually <malay>macam gini</malay> even if you go
to any other country <malay>macam</malay> thailand even #bali# or what [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a <malay>dua dapur</malay>
one <malay>dapur</malay> is for the halal the other <malay>dapur</malay> is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they <malay>ada dua dapur</malay> for those pure
muslims usually <malay>yang macam</malay> if you go japan is those
<malay>orang kita cakap mualaf</malay> [ah] <malay>orang jepun mualaf ke apa</malay> [ah] they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the <malay>dia punya</malay> sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually <malay>kalau macam kita punya</malay> singapore <malay>ada</malay> MUIS
[ah] so they also have their own <malay>punya</malay> MUIS [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those (uh) restaurants <malay>yang</malay> mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think <malay>dia punya</malay> rental <malay>dia punya duit</malay>
<malay>sewa dia</malay> every month is very expensive so they need to cover [lah] they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive (mm) korea <malay>jepun</malay> all the same even #bali# even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop <malay>dia punya</malay> area
hundred percent halal they won't accept (err) alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting [kan] that's what I when if you go around the world then you see [lah]
(mm)
correct correct correct is like that one
that's how they live their life I mean <malay>untuk kita kalau macam</malay> extra <malay>was-was kita jangan makan</malay> but you must we must know that there is actually two <malay>dapur</malay>
it's not one <malay>dapur</malay> they make they mix everything together no no no two different <malay>dapur</malay>
(uh) so they have the alcoholic
actually they <malay>yang</malay> the alcohol <malay>pun</malay> it's not really <malay>dapur</malay> [lah] it's just <malay>macam</malay> a bar just a bar place
for them to to you know to do their things
[ah] so that is the gist [lah]
(err) cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty [ah] but since <malay>kita pun dah ada banyak</malay> options <malay>sekarang</malay> so (mm)
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy [ah] but again [lah] like
(uh) what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much [lah] <malay>kalau macam dia cakap buah</malay> avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday <malay>nanti</malay> you get other complications when you get when you eat <malay>benda yang</malay> is too good everyday is no good if you search
into youtube [kan]
there's this <malay>guru</malay> from india he say garlic is the best (uh) medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
(uh) have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic <malay>punya</malay> (uh) <malay>cara perubatan</malay> really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic <malay>punya</malay> treatment they all use garlic
[ah] yes cause garlic is very good [lah] basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
<malay>apa tu</malay>
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy [eh] I
healthy
fruits [lah] I eat fruits [lah] but (uh) if you want it
okay [ah] usually fruits [lah] I just eat fruits
<malay>itu aje</malay> the most the most healthiest <malay>yang</malay> I eat
[oh] almost everyday is egg [lah] by right egg is is considered healthy food [mah]
skills [eh] meaning what
<malay>apa-apa</malay> skills [lah] is it the the the
hardware <malay>dengan</malay> software <malay>punya</malay> skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether <malay>nak jadi apa</malay> I say I <malay>nak jadi kaya</malay> [kan] so
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code [lah] code very very well so that I can build
(err) games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine [ah] you <malay>dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja</malay> eight to five
or <malay>kerja</malay> shift or whatever
<malay>untuk cari nafkah</malay> you straightaway have an app
and that is your business product [ah] after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
cause <malay>sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua</malay> they
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in <malay>negeri macam kita ni</malay> singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause <malay>kita punya negeri</malay> [ah] is the hub for education so if we have the right skills <malay>kita boleh bikin</malay> product from that skill
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
(uh) one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
I <malay>suka makan</malay> so I <malay>kalau boleh</malay> skill <malay>untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak</malay> (um) but one thing [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>suka masak</malay> I don't like to
<malay>masak</malay> a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before <malay>dia punya barang mahal-mahal</malay> portion <malay>besar</malay> yes <malay>dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam</malay> very posh
<malay>tetapi</malay> their fusion food <malay>macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu</malay> even <malay>dengan tekak orang putih</malay> they don't like cause (um) when you
fusion western <malay>dengan</malay> asian <malay>punya makanan</malay>
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
(uh) I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants <malay>yang ada makanan</malay> fusion <malay>yang betul-betul</malay>
(err) how to say <malay>ada dia punya rasa dia</malay> is you can actually you can want to go there again [lah]
<malay>tak ada</malay>
all
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event <malay>macam</malay> birthday <malay>ke kawan-kawan nak</malay> celebrate birthday promotions <malay>ke</malay> [ah] probably
<malay>sekali-sekala macam gitu dah</malay> but for
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause (uh) again [ah]
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again (uh) it's all about the skill set [ah] if we got
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money <malay>untuk apa</malay> [kan]
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food [ah]
just say food
[oh] ya (uh) the last skill [eh] I have [eh] okay basically for me [eh] I <malay>daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah</malay> start <malay>belajar</malay> karate [lah]
(uh) I really want to have that kind of skill <malay>untuk</malay>
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it <malay>macam</malay> example karate
[ah] judo <malay>ataupun</malay> mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
karate under okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style
and okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style is actually the original <malay>punya</malay> karate [lah] which is actually
goes very deep [lah] and also very (err)
they have very rich history (uh) their okinawan
in fact <malay>yang</malay> karate <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang jepun</malay> practice is actually fake
cause <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about <malay>orang jepun</malay> it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate
it's called <malay>nama dia bukan</malay> karate <malay>nama dia</malay> karate-do
do <malay>dalam bahasa jepun</malay> is a way of life even judo
karate-do #aikido#
all the do <malay>yang kat belakang semua</malay> is actually <malay>maksud orang jepun</malay>
is a way of life so <malay>orang jepun</malay> is more on to the perfectionism
<malay>tapi</malay> if you really learn the original okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style it's more of the
the relax <malay>orang</malay> #okinawa# actually <malay>belajar</malay> karate like even
<malay>kalau awak awak belajar</malay> #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate [kan]
even if you come late the the <malay>orang</malay> the instructor <malay>tu</malay> can actually still accept you but for <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate
if you're late for one minute [eh] they totally banned you from the class at all
so <malay>untuk orang</malay> #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate is actually <malay>untuk orang malas-malas</malay> (err) like myself
actually <malay>orang</malay> okay the main difference between #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate <malay>dengan</malay> japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate is this <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to (oo) (oo) <malay>dia kira itu dia punya</malay> how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by (uh) contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think [ah] <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate is by contracting their body
<malay>untuk kasih badan dia</malay> tense
(uh) cause <malay>untuk dia orang</malay> what they learn from
#aikido# judo <malay>ni semua</malay> if you
tense your body means you have more strength but by right #okinawa# the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
(um) you can practise the real okinawan <malay>punya punya</malay> martial arts [ah] <malay>punya ni</malay> karate cause even
<malay>dia</malay> they call this <malay>macam kita</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia bunga-bunga</malay> [lah] <malay>kita punya silat bunga-bunga</malay>
<malay>orang jepun pun ada</malay>
(err) <malay>orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> is a
<malay>nama dia</malay> #kata# #kata#
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okinawan <malay>punya</malay> #kata# is actually more
realistic more relax and more
practical <malay>tapi orang jepun punya</malay> #kata# is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't (uh) focus about <malay>dia punya</malay> feel
actually <malay>ini</malay> karate <malay>ni semua</malay> [eh] it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a <malay>budak yang belajar</malay> okinawan karate <malay>dengan</malay> japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm <malay>budak</malay> #okinawa# they will win cause <malay>orang jepun</malay> they also learn #kata# but <malay>dia punya</malay> #kata# and karate <malay>dia</malay> they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause <malay>untuk orang</malay>
korea <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>orang</malay> korea <malay>punya</malay> the way they fight <malay>bila</malay> when they practise
#kata# it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
but <malay>orang jepun dia punya</malay> #kata#
the stands <malay>dia punya kuda-kuda dia</malay> is
to charge at the long distance
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original <malay>punya</malay> martial arts fight is for
to fight the short distance
you ask them to fight each other <malay>yang</malay> long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan <malay>punya orang</malay>
come close to japanese <malay>punya</malay>
karate <malay>punya budak</malay>
<malay>dia akan</malay> blur <malay>dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin</malay>
[ah] that's why when they have the any competitions
okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate will always win japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate
but the big but [eh] <malay>orang</malay> #okinawa# even though they are more relax <malay>dia punya</malay> gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
#okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate [kan] every class only maximum ten to fifteen people <malay>yang belajar</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya guru dia</malay> they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate <malay>lama-lama</malay> is dying out
but japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class <malay>ada dalam</malay> hundred people
two hundred people <malay>tiga ratus orang belajar</malay> in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
they do not know about okinawan the original one
[ah] and also in [ah] in japan <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
they are trained not to use any weapons
but by right the original karate <malay>yang</malay> from okinawan one
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use (uh) a weapon to fight
that is the true essence of okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate
[ah] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>bezanya</malay> it's actually there's a lot of difference [ah] you can talk
three days three nights [eh] <malay>tiga hari tiga malam boleh</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis</malay> cause it's actually the <malay>punya cerita</malay> is very interesting
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really [ah] do research on it
sorry again
was free
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
okay for singapore context [eh] <malay>aku nak percuma senang</malay> [jer]
<malay>aku nak rumah percuma aku nak kereta percuma</malay>
(err)
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
yes of course healthcare
cause healthcare <malay>dekat</malay> singapore <malay>yang paling mahal lepas tu</malay>
<malay>yang lain benda percuma</malay> is of course <malay>kereta dengan rumah</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal</malay>
<malay>orang budak-budak</malay> singapore <malay>ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah</malay>
<malay>yang dia orang boleh mampu</malay> (uh) mostly is that's the case [lah] <malay>lepas tu yang pasal</malay>
<malay>kereta</malay> of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
<malay>yang kau dah kasih orang</malay> lease for ten years <malay>engkau</malay> charge <malay>orang tu sampai</malay> hundred over thousand for a a normal car
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this (err)
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
carparks <malay>yang kita ada</malay> is <malay>tak cukup</malay>
I mean that is the realistic view [lah] but if like you say you ask me again
<malay>apa barang</malay> free <malay>nak</malay> of course [lah] <malay>nak rumah kereta dengan</malay> healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare <malay>dah ada pernah</malay> personal experience [ah] <malay>kalau dekat</malay> singapore you do not have any insurance <malay>apa-apa jadi dengan</malay> you [ah]
<malay>bayar</malay> [lah] <malay>sendiri sampai pokai</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> insurance <malay>boleh</malay> cover <malay>sikit</malay> at least <malay>duit tu boleh cari juga</malay> [lah]
<malay>boleh apa orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>termampu</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> no insurance at all [ah] <malay>kena bayar pokai-pokai</malay> [ah] <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>hidup nak</malay>
humans no longer
[oh]
[oh]
okay [ah]
<malay>sifat manusia ni</malay>
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
what we do okay <malay>kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu</malay>
then <malay>zaman kegemilangan</malay> islam
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the <malay>khalifah punya</malay> empire
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
<malay>dia orang tak payah nak nak pergi menanam tak payah nak pergi jual barang tak payah nak apa-apa dia orang ada macam itu hidup dia orang</malay>
<malay>ada dibiayai</malay> [lah] <malay>oleh</malay>
<malay>kita punya khalifah dulu</malay>
so <malay>apa dia orang bikin</malay>
<malay>dia orang belajar</malay>
<malay>dia belajar</malay> (um) (err)
<malay>zaman-zaman</malay> rome <malay>punya punya buku-buku</malay>
they translate <malay>daripada</malay> latin <malay>pergi</malay> arab
in fact [ah] even the egyptian <malay>punya</malay> historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why <malay>kita banyak</malay> actually a lot of our
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually [ah] push [ah] <malay>macam</malay> all the
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
(mm)
everything
so <malay>kalau untuk zaman sekarang</malay> if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing [lah] we will explore <malay>untuk sekarang lagi kita ada</malay> we are very modernize
so most likely will
<malay>kita akan</malay> explore the space [ah]
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
[ah] just [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
go to mars maybe go to venus
[ah] cause I think that is the way to go [lah] you just want to explore
<malay>kita manusia ni</malay> we we love to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
we automatically learn a lot of new things [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] repeat repeat <malay>soalan</malay>
activity [eh]
meaning what [ah]
work <malay>bukan</malay> activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity <malay>kalau</malay> activity
(hmm) [ah] eight hours [eh]
activity [eh] activity
activity
eight hours [eh]
!wah!
no no no is working out
okay activity <malay>yang paling</malay> boring [kan] [eh]
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight <malay>tak boleh</malay> cause (uh) you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight [eh] I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
<malay>apa tu</malay>
karma
ya
(mm) <malay>kalau</malay> okay [lah]
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke [lah] if a comical joke easy [ah] double cheeseburger
cause why I every time I hungry <malay>kalau rumah tak ada makan</malay> I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause (err) my life how to say [ah]
it's a pretty boring [lah]
<malay>kira</malay> [kan] I don't do a lot of stuff
<malay>dekat luar</malay> I'm always at home so <malay>kalau</malay>
say about <malay>macam</malay> bad stuff no [lah] not really [lah]
<malay>kalau ada</malay> bad stuff <malay>mesti hidup pun</malay> I can't sleep at night also [lah]
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> not really [lah]
I <malay>yang pasal ni</malay> I can't really say much [lah] [ah] ya
actor [eh] (err)
okay [ah] actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
(um) he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
<malay>dia punya</malay> abs <malay>tu</malay> eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one [ah] also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like (err)
what troy that
trojan war troy
<malay>dia jadi</malay> achilles achilles <malay>itu punya</malay> movie okay I like two movies [ah] in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] troy so that the difference
between this [ah]
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
is actually <malay>pasal orang paling kuat</malay> achilles
that cannot be killed (uh) then after that
(mm) in the end he died he have a choice actually <malay>kalau dia</malay> if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong [lah]
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
had eternal glory <malay>macam orang ingat dia</malay>
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
[ah] [orh] even beyond that (um) you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that [eh]
any normal egoistic man he actually (uh) it shows <malay>kita manusia</malay> especially man [ah] (uh) all
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male [ah] character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this [ah] characters also this achilles
(uh) his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya [lah] and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
about this movie right about three hundred and <malay>ni</malay> [ah] troy is all the quotes that they used
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used (um) can really
make if you really into this [ah] like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful [lah] I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity <malay>itu</malay> word [eh] <malay>macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena</malay>
<malay>soal jawab</malay>
so it's it's about the same thing and also <malay>dalam</malay>
[ah] <malay>gambar-gambar macam</malay> achilles <malay>ni semua</malay> troy <malay>ni semua</malay> it's all the same thing it's their quotes [eh] you can actually bring it to real life and <malay>ikut</malay> [lah] so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out [one] [lah]
ya that's the gist
[oh] how I keep [ah] I don't know [leh]
actually I just went through life [ah]
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that (um)
after I read a book for half an hour
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
all these (uh) youtube [lah] especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it [lah]
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read [one]
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy <malay>yang</malay>
texts <malay>yang panjang-panjang semua</malay>
I don't like I would
prefer texts <malay>yang macam</malay>
<malay>yang pendek-pendek</malay> short and sweet <malay>kirakan macam gitu</malay> yes summary and also mostly
pictures and of course obviously the videos [lah] I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right (err) I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something [ah] (err) you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist [ah]
thirty two <malay>tiga puluh dua tahun</malay>
seventeen years old [eh]
seventeen years
old self
<malay>tengah buat apa</malay> is it the O levels
[ah]
seventeen
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] actually seventeen
need to know [ah] you need to give me a time period
seventeen
[oh] poly [eh]
(err)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] actually <malay>nak cakap</malay> (err)
advice
actually <malay>kalau</malay> if I look back in my life right
I don't truthfully [ah] I don't regret anything
<malay>kalau</malay> whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever [lah] I've been through (um) but <malay>kalau betul-betul nak</malay> advice of course [lah] (um)
advice [eh] okay the best thing is
[ah]
cause at that time also <malay>kalau misal kata nak cakap</malay> [oh] you learn coding you learn all these app making right
[ah] actually frankly speaking [eh] at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn <malay>sekolah</malay> poly that I learn is actually that was the
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago [ah] and actually
(err) <malay>orang yang ajar tu pun</malay> the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that (err) they are not that brilliant also
[ah] if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
so if you ask me to <malay>macam</malay> you know to start a something new I don't think (uh) there will be good advice cause
even for those like you imagine [ah]
microsoft mark zuckerberg <malay>ni semua</malay> [eh] the way they start [kan] is a really is all a downhill task [lah]
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
(err)
things in life yet
[ah] so cause also <malay>apa-apapun nak kena</malay> see
your character back then when you
(uh)
<malay>tujuh belas tahun</malay>
so my character when I was only
<malay>tujuh belas tahun</malay> really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned !wah! <malay>betul-betul</malay> (uh) <malay>benda baru</malay>
that kind of thing so just live life [lah]
just a live my life that's all [lah] (mm)
!wah! <malay>ni banyak</malay> boss <malay>semua cakap gini</malay>
where do I see myself [eh]
in five years' time [eh] okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same [ah] as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married [lah] so usually is you do like that
you just be normal stuff [ah] five years' time [eh] okay <malay>kalau cakap pasal</malay> goals [eh] (um)
actually
