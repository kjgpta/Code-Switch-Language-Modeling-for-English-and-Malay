[oh] it was so much fun after a long time I <malay>tak pergi kerja</malay> then went back so met (um)
it's a small group [lah] not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then (um) the place also okay [lah] not so busy last time used to be very busy but now (um) because of the COVID thing so companies send their
[ah] their staff
(um) <malay>macam</malay> in a small group [lah] instead of last time one big group
a participant they only allocate (uh) fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like (err) two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
[oh] I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the (err)
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
group [lah] but no more number of days <malay>dia panjang</malay> [ah] (um) james was the in charge [ah] it's quite fun [lah]
I don't know because the deal is (um) they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges [lah]
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
(um) the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge [ah] one que
and one and then myself doing (um)
but surprisingly all the participant came for
[ah]
screening right they are prepared <malay>awal</malay> you know I mean normal
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
<malay>kerja dari rumah</malay> more relax they says [ah] then they say [oh] then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
<malay>tadi tadi</malay> one is from (um) one's from mycrone
if <malay>nenek pekik-pekik</malay>
(mmhmm)
because I told <malay>bibik</malay> to give anxiety pill early
I think <malay>nenek</malay> is more on anxiety rather than depression [ah] because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
[ah] she [ah] panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
[ah] so I guess it's more anxiety than <malay>dari</malay> depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit <malay>termenung</malay> thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then (uh) there is
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause (uh) every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
and she started want to pray then she [ah] <malay>tak yakin</malay> that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and (um)
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
not (um) it's quite to say [lah] couple of days when she was at the peak (um) which is really really very I should say <malay>macam mana</malay> very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
her <malay>macam</malay> worse or <malay>ataupun dia punya</malay> (um) <malay>paling tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya mengamuk atau</malay> dementia <malay>punya</malay> (err)
level
so as what you say [lah] maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like <malay>macam</malay> quite [ah] quite more peaceful (um)
(um) more <malay>macam</malay> if she she shouted yell and (err)
but not much and then (err) at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming <malay>ataupun nak minta keluar</malay> from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
which is different [lah] this today's it's so much different from the past
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just <malay>redha</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>ikhlas</malay> and <malay>redha</malay>
ya
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone <malay>itu sahaja</malay> (um) from last time she doesn't want to be alone
she's a bit timid [lah] I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister [lah] but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really [lah]
timid is different from people who is fierce #shah# timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
<malay>hantu</malay> are not human
she's very <malay>garang</malay> human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing [lah] she's very scared the rest I don't think so [lah] <malay>macam</malay> people she's not afraid of [lah] none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
ya she went through all the assessment
of course [lah] unless she says like stupid things [lah] then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans [lah] <malay>merepek</malay> [jer] accounting but cute [lah] she answer
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that (uh) these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but (err) she turned to me and tell me of like (um)
<malay>apa ni merepek nak balik</malay> [ah] which is funny [lah]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you (um)
what's your name how many children you have <malay>lepas tu dia tanya</malay>
all the personal things [lah] then <malay>tanya</malay>
(um) past then present then <malay>tanya</malay> in between so
cute [lah] but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up [lah] so she <malay>macam ada</malay> rest and then after that continue again (um)
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no (um)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
you didn't
(mm)
(mm) ya
(mm)
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
(mm)
ya but the progression is like (um) the progression is actually <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] people
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much [ah] maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
(um) which <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] [ah] depression [lah] maybe [lah]
difficult for me to say [lah] because it involved brain and then like <malay>nenek</malay> they said that some of her brains already stroke
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
educate the caregiver <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
because <malay>dia orang ni</malay> sooner or later they going to be
(um)
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
(oo)
(uh) sooner or later she she will forgot how to (err) right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say [ah] [eh] I thought you want to (err) pass motion or you want to <malay>kencing</malay> and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that (um)
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the (uh) leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad [lah] mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
(um) professional <malay>ataupun</malay> [ah]
nurses <malay>yang</malay>
(um)
well educate about all this <malay>macam</malay> well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is (err) no the better [lah] no way I'm quite difficult [lah] this this this this dementia or old aging <malay>punya</malay> (err) problem [eh] it's going to hit the world
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
the youngsters educate the youngsters <malay>ataupun macam</malay> make it a point that
(um)
or <malay>anak mesti nak kena jaga</malay> parents <malay>atau</malay> there is this centre <malay>ataupun</malay> help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
<malay>kita kena ada</malay> this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
[eh] <malay>tak baik</malay> say <malay>dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik</malay> say <malay>tak nak jaga mak bapa dia</malay>
the because people don't go through
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that <malay>macam kita nak</malay> abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say [eh] <malay>tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak</malay>
so it's gonna be the same
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that <malay>ataupun</malay> european europe country <malay>atau</malay> the america they find that sending the
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
<malay>dalam islam</malay> okay <malay>kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan</malay> a must
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put (err) into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got (um) cousin [lah] she could say [ah] eight boys [ah] the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be (err) medical attention given to her [ah] anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then (err) third she got (um) caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver (mm) they have
(err) nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know (um) half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday (err) maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so [lah] because she's already bedridden
(um) don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this (um)
kind of <malay>macam</malay> (err) educate <malay>ataupun</malay> information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
that's that's what my opinion is [lah]
ya I know
(mm)
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this (err) dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya [lah] I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
[oh] [eh] you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
<malay>macam</malay> preparation for the future for the future or
old generation [lah]
I think so because but (mm) but I don't think so they take nowadays they <malay>dia orang macam tak</malay> encouraged but they are
they have this <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>dia tak</malay> encourage <malay>tapi dia dah dah</malay> ready
<malay>faham tak</malay>
I did in this [ah] they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you <malay>dah tua</malay> you <malay>tak nak tinggal dengan anak</malay> you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a (um) estate where a lot of amenities <malay>macam</malay> vast or or supermarket doctors <malay>dekat dekat</malay> and then (err) the whole building <malay>dia orang pun ada macam</malay> (err)
(err)
how should I say <malay>macam dia orang ada</malay>
clubhouse [lah] something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but <malay>dia orang tak macam</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh]
have campaign <malay>ataupun macam kasih</malay>
<malay>tahu dengan</malay> public no they just do it you want it
okay this (uh) we have it you know <malay>tapi dia tak ada</malay> encouragement <malay>ataupun dia kasih macam</malay> I find [lah] <malay>macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni</malay> not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
an idea <malay>ataupun dia</malay> come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system [mah]
they don't they they say said very (err) how should I say (uh) <malay>tak macam besar</malay> [tau] like very big <malay>macam siapa tahu tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>siapa tak tahu tak tahu</malay> [lah] that kind of thing
you know like like like specially our money [ah] nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
so it's kind of like <malay>macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu</malay>
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
then they are they are well informed otherwise <malay>takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang</malay> be bothered <malay>takde orang tahu</malay> [lah] (um) that's the problem [lah]
that's problem [lah] people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right (err) your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card (err) see see and then (err) this this lady said !hey! you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is (err) (err) giving some (uh) help fund because I really apply then is it [oh] you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true (mm) how to accommodate right
<malay>kita tak macam</malay> based we are free religious
(um)
(um)
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious [lah] I think the more points of
other activity <malay>macam</malay> [ah] more of entertainment entertainment and activity [lah] you know of <malay>ataupun</malay>
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite (um) (err)
complex [lah] I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
(um) I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
old folk citizen soon or not far also but (err) right now people at my age I should say <malay>ataupun</malay> people at <malay>pak</malay> age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
<malay>atau</malay> plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both <malay>ada</malay> compromise both <malay>boleh</malay> plan <malay>sama-sama</malay> and both also <malay>boleh</malay> you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
(um) I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at (err) until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't (uh) take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
<malay>macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun</malay> I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
[oh] what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the <malay>dah tak boleh juga</malay>
I <malay>kena orang</malay> then I know I don't want to burden my children (um)
<malay>kau orang</malay> share <malay>cari orang jaga mak</malay> that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday [ah] one of my children must visit me [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>ataupun nanti cuti</malay> come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> [eh] <malay>banyak karang ni</malay> I see like <malay>macam</malay> my girlfriends
are people that I know [ah] they have mom which go every week go to every are of (err) <malay>anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu</malay> I I don't know whether is it a good idea because <malay>mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin</malay> is it
[oh] at this stage [eh] <malay>dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit</malay> is it good for her to change
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
the second option is so much better because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> burden others because you see [ah]
<malay>anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul</malay> [ah] children wants to but you must also remember <malay>anak-anak</malay> not the spouse <malay>ada anak</malay> I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then (um) <malay>anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya</malay>
peace also it's like (um) <malay>mak ni macam jadi macam</malay> you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you <malay>faham tak</malay>
unless you <malay>macam</malay> okay let's see [lah] this is
[ah] what I think it's good it's like <malay>macam</malay> let's say I <malay>ada empat anak</malay> I <malay>ada dua belas cucu</malay> something like that <malay>dua belas cucu enam yang</malay> very (um) <malay>macam dah</malay> secondary school <malay>ataupun dah pergi</malay> tertiary you know which they can help
you know so <malay>empat</malay> plus <malay>enam sepuluh sepuluh ni</malay> take turn [lah] take turns to (um) go to grandma house to this (err) monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then (err) this day to this day okay <malay>mak pula yang kena tinggal sana</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> take care out <malay>dia orang ada ni</malay> [eh] <malay>ada</malay> helpers twenty four seven <malay>dekat dalam rumah tapi</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> make sure stay <malay>duduk makan tengokkan dia</malay> the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be [lah]
rather than (err) <malay>kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis</malay> I <malay>rasa macam gitu lagi</malay> better [lah] <malay>emak yang</malay> in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
you mean you're not used to it that (uh) you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
[ah] sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
monday and thursday my turn okay <malay>dia ni</malay> wednesday and friday <malay>dia ni</malay> so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
[ah] contribute no that's what I think [lah]
I I mean right now this is
(uh) right now right now right now at this situation that I (um)
at present [ah] most of my (err) friends
other elderly parents so (um) I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in <malay>mak nenek</malay> into one station the rest all have to rotate [lor] whether dementia <malay>ke tak</malay> dementia <malay>ke pun</malay> rotate
[oh] maybe <malay>macam cik rosnah</malay> [lah] <malay>cik rosnah punya mak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu satu</malay> place when maid with with the helper than everybody come <malay>cik rosnah</malay> come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then (err) also so cute then they have this like <malay>macam</malay> caregiver <malay>punya</malay> holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then <malay>anak-anak lain</malay> have to sit take care
(um) so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam pada mak</malay> [lah] better <malay>mak</malay> that way [lor] I don't know
(mm)
[oh] you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
(um) ya
[lah] you got a point there also [lah] it's what you say <malay>tapi kalau sebelum dia orang</malay> could are given a task <malay>kita kena</malay> educate [lah] the main thing here the the the role model is very important
(um) how you want to (err) how you
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them <malay>macam kita tak boleh</malay>
(um) <malay>macam</malay> !alamak! this week I cannot [lah] I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go [eh] I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to (um) <malay>macam kita kena tunjuk positif</malay> that <malay>kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita</malay> look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment [oh] I can't
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that [oh] it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
(um)
(um) ya true
ya true <malay>sebab masa tu nenek</malay> okay
but <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang nenek</malay> have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really [ah] really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand [lah]
(um) that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is <malay>kuat takpe</malay> that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know <malay>dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul</malay> because <malay>dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan</malay>
you know <malay>kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana</malay> okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one <malay>nak cuba cuba</malay> calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
<malay>siapa yang tak marah</malay> even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
you know so quickly the other
party must come out <malay>kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun</malay> [ah] <malay>ikat orang tua</malay> (um) <malay>macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang</malay>
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid <malay>itu yang buat</malay>
(um) <malay>banyak terjadi</malay> didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this [lah] because <malay>nenek</malay> is actually educating me you know
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna <malay>macam sakit ke macam</malay> (um)
<malay>bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan</malay> (um)
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
<malay>punya punya apa</malay> mental mental <malay>punya</malay>
our readiness [oh] <malay>mesti nak kuat</malay>
ya really last time I people always says [ah] <malay>tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua</malay> then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I <malay>geram sangat ke</malay> then what is <malay>syurga</malay>
<malay>macam tu</malay> I can't even reach <malay>syurga</malay> if I do this to my mum
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
I take care of her not because I want <malay>syurga</malay> I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to <malay>macam</malay>
I she's get she got annoyed her you know <malay>ataupun</malay> you know I <malay>tak boleh tahan dengan dia</malay> then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
[ah] ya that's why I said because I <malay>cakap</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> awareness [ah] so it's something that <malay>macam</malay> god is given me awareness [oh] okay this is what you need to do [lah] that I need I can plan compared
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
[ah] twenty four seven take care of <malay>punya</malay>
[ah]
<malay>orang tua</malay> and then they they they now I have [ah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard <malay>atau</malay> by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
now it's a time for them to take care of me
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through <malay>tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena</malay> take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang bila mak fikir</malay>
or as what you say [lah] don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
(err) <malay>macam</malay> knowledge <malay>macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu</malay> I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give (um) <malay>macam</malay>
a talk <malay>atau macam kasih</malay> volunteer <malay>atau</malay> told people or need help <malay>atau</malay> need advice I think I have
I have the capability [lah]
the
(um) (mm) (um)
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have (err) your energy level is our only that point of time [eh] is that much
and then you have feeling [ah] that [ah] you are human that you know that (uh) sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this

breakdown
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing [ah] technician go machine you know <malay>macam mana</malay> machine
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion <malay>dia orang</malay> emotional <malay>dia orang</malay> is so complex that we
don't know [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> professional you are a good [ah]
it you'd secretaries <malay>apa ke</malay> all of them based on experience or <malay>dia orang punya</malay> client <malay>punya</malay> patients <malay>punya</malay> experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because <malay>dia tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak</malay> okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay <malay>kita kasih penat tapi tetap</malay> keep on scream <malay>bukan itu dia tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> scream <malay>sebab sakit perut</malay> you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being <malay>dia macam</malay> twins [lah] twins <malay>muka sama</malay> everything <malay>sama tapi tetap perangai lain</malay>
(um) (um)
somehow you were saying that family knows best [lah]
okay (err) family know best in terms of tackling one (err) let's say the mother [lah] because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
her likes and dislikes you know the (err) for the professional we bring it to the they I just (uh) based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
(err) other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> family members <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> and then (um) very important [lah]
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming (err) since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
[oh] so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> they call it (err)
trial and error also
(um) ya true
(um)
so because chicken
[oh] complain and complain
(mm) (oo) (mm) (mm)
(oo)
<malay>makan</malay> ya
[ah] nevermind just like grandma [lah] <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak bilang</malay> actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say <malay>nak keluar tak boleh tidur</malay>
you know she said [ah] <malay>mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa</malay> and then when we stopped her from going out the she said <malay>mak nak kencing</malay>
there's a [oh] <malay>sebenarnya nak kencing</malay> [eh] [ah] then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after <malay>kencing</malay> you <malay>tidur</malay> okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
(err) so sometimes <malay>kat dalam bilik pun sama</malay> and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place <malay>atau bilik</malay> is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
[oh] <malay>bilik dia sejuk</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar</malay> she keep on saying <malay>nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar</malay> then we keep asking why <malay>nak keluar</malay> then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us [ah] only if she could tell <malay>mak nak keluar</malay> because [ah] <malay>bilik ni gelap</malay> [lah] <malay>bilik ni sejuk</malay> [ah] okay <malay>kita tidur kat luar</malay> that will be much
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
(um)
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers <malay>dia dah penuh</malay> (um)
<malay>susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada</malay> some [ah]
crack <malay>ataupun</malay> ulcer <malay>ataupun sakit perut</malay> I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> baby it get get baby <malay>kita kita jaga macam dia punya</malay> journey is to be independent [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> old folks <malay>kita jaga</malay> needed is to be dependent
(mm) ya
