(mm)
(mm) three wishes [eh] okay firstly I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nak jadi</malay> billionaire
(mm) because
<malay>jadi</malay> billionaire I feel secure
and having a lot of money
can actually solve a lot of problem <malay>macam</malay> if like in case of emergencies like
<malay>macam</malay> accident <malay>ke apa</malay> I have the money already
or like when I want to buy something that I like
I can like feel rich you know like <malay>macam jalan sana jalan sini</malay> [eh] I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
then the second one I think I want my own transport
so I want my own transport and <malay>rumah</malay>
so like what you asked right I <malay>rasa</malay> transport I <malay>nak motor ke kereta ke</malay>
[oh] best part is
I <malay>nak</malay> my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
<malay>tak payah nak tunggu</malay> flights <malay>pun</malay>
like I want to go here and there I can <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sembarang</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak</malay> flight okay <malay>aku naik aku punya</malay> private jet that kind of thing
like also [kan] <malay>macam bawa orang</malay> [lah] like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so <malay>macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam</malay> you know <malay>sekarang kita nak naik</malay> plane <malay>pun nak kena bayar</malay> for the air ticket right
but I since I already
have the private jet why not I just <malay>macam</malay> families let's go like I can
I can <malay>payung</malay> you guys for
the travel you know
transportation [ah] [eh] <malay>tapi duit belanja tak</malay>
ya then the third one
I want to have like
I want to conquer a lot of language so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> skill like that [kan]
like what's you skill [oh] I can speak a lot of language <malay>gitu macam</malay> but I want to speak like the common one [lah] <malay>macam</malay> mandarin (uh) korean it's like
common <malay>sekarang</malay> then
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
<malay>kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam</malay> nice right like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
since it's a wish right <malay>dia macam bukan macam</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
[eh] <malay>sudah aku nak letak</malay> magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need [lah] <malay>tak payah</malay>
so what about you
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
talking about family gathering
you know about <malay>yang seratus</malay> dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
or like amusement park [ah] all that <malay>ada</malay> tourism
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
you want to picnic <malay>ke nak</malay> overnight
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait [lah] for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau dia dua ratus lebih</malay> then
you can only use your your own only [kan] <malay>abeh bayar seratus lebih gila</malay>
then
maybe we can picnic <malay>ke apa</malay> right what you said picnic then <malay>kalau kita</malay> picnic <malay>pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak</malay>
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no [lah] we put that aside first then we
<malay>macam</malay> hotel then chalet <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>untuk</malay> staycation <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] (mm) actually not bad [ah] I think the idea is not bad <malay>abeh kita boleh</malay> barbecue <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kalau kita macam</malay>
chalet
chalet <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> chalet <malay>tu boleh</malay> barbecue [pe]
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food [lah]
forever food and our transportation
and then <malay>macam rumah</malay> okay <malay>rumah</malay> maybe like <malay>macam</malay> if it's like four hundred we can just
like
share among us
so it's like <malay>satu orang</malay> like <malay>berapa berapa puluh</malay> dollar <malay>gitu</malay> or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>untuk makan dengan minum</malay> okay [ah] nice then we can just cook or we can like <malay>macam</malay> chalet or what we <malay>tempat dia boleh masak</malay> [kan] so
we can just buy our groceries <malay>ke apa</malay>
then we <malay>macam simpan dalam</malay> fridge then <malay>esok tu</malay> breakfast <malay>boleh masak</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> then
I think by lunch <malay>gitu</malay> we need to
book out already [kan] so okay [lah]
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
[kan] celebration also need more money
because right <malay>takkan kita nak buat macam</malay> so called birthday party <malay>tak ada</malay> decoration <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
decoration need money also
I mean we can buy <malay>macam dekat</malay> daiso <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] so <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat</malay> neighbourhood kind of shop [kan]
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
so I'm not sure if <malay>kalau</malay> (mm) but it's a nice idea [lah] to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> both
party together like that
because we can <malay>macam</malay> save up a bit of money rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>satu</malay> birthday party <malay>lepas tu</malay> birthday party <malay>lagi habis duit</malay> then
(um) you know that a
<malay>tu</malay> confirm confirm <malay>kena bayar lagi</malay> [eh] service <malay>tu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mm)
nice but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation <malay>macam</malay> like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
we should use chalet or something rather than that because <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> rules or regulations <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>kita pun nak buat macam</malay> we want to save
cause <malay>sekali tak</malay> save [eh] (uh) government <malay>pula</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] like some agency <malay>datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih</malay> [eh]
ya [lah] marina is nice [lah]
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one (uh) one place where I know
(err) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> rooftop like that [ah]
not not really rooftop <malay>dia macam</malay> not rooftop or shelter <malay>tapi macam</malay> indoor <malay>sikit</malay>
[ah] we can we can find the place around there so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>kita tak kena</malay>
because marina west coast east coast <malay>tu semua</malay> is all
outdoor [pe]
so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> we still <malay>boleh lepak depan situ</malay>
cause that time when I went (uh) to marina
for a picnic with my friends we actually <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
<malay>abeh</malay> okay maybe <malay>kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita</malay> pack up <malay>sudah hujan lebat</malay> [kan]
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there [ah]
because it's like !alah! <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [jer] point point point
<malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [kan]
so
we
<malay>pergi cari</malay>
I mean we got the what is called [ah] <malay>yang besar tu</malay> parasol [eh]
parasol whatever [lah]
[ah] <malay>yang payung besar tu</malay>
we brought that also so <malay>kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ</malay> we <malay>letak</malay> so
[ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> what is it <malay>macam terpercik</malay> [eh] is it <malay>terpercik macam</malay> <malay>hujan kena</malay>
[ah] splash [lah]
like
if we <malay>macam takut hujan</malay> splash on us then we put the (uh) the <malay>payung besar</malay>
(mm) even though we under the <malay>macam</malay> cover [kan] but still [lah] we just
<malay>letak pasal takut kena juga</malay>
but still like nice because
<malay>kita tak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal kita letak payung besar tu</malay>
I think I think our cousin have I think [ah] I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still (uh) that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> glamping is it <malay>dia macam</malay> wait [ah]
ya ya this one [ah]
(mm) nice we can go this kind
(mm)
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
I don't think <malay>dia orang akan macam</malay>
(err) <malay>kau nak</malay> stay <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu</malay> I don't think
they let us
(mm)
I not sure later after this we can google [ah] whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think that's good though but rather than <malay>macam</malay> we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
(err) take <malay>macam</malay> morning like that no we should like <malay>macam petang petang gitu</malay>
we should rent from <malay>petang petang</malay>
<malay>sampai ke malam</malay> like that so <malay>sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu</malay> ya we should rent that kind
so that <malay>macam</malay>
we confirm know we won't sleep [what]
[oh] nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle [lah]
(mm)
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate [eh]
but I I don't know <malay>kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu</malay> skate <malay>macam</malay> you don't know how to skate [kan]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>abeh kalau aku</malay> roller blade <malay>sorang</malay> [eh] <malay>sedih</malay> [sia] <malay>aku orang semua</malay> cycle cycle cycle <malay>aku</malay> [eh] roller blade <malay>dengan aku</malay>
no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad [ah]
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade [lah] no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
!whoa! okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before [ah] but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
(mm)
what about glove
for rental [lah]
(mm)
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want [ah]
what if people really got like
pee on it or what !eww! but ya still !ee! okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
[oh] I remember that time my [eh] my cousin our cousin our cousin said <malay>nak pergi</malay> zoo
<malay>merepek pergi</malay> zoo <malay>pergi</malay> zoo <malay>tengok binatang</malay> [jer]
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
both of us we don't really like animals <malay>macam</malay> !hey! <malay>kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>binatang tu</malay>
like
what's more that that you can do over there
maybe <malay>aku tak</malay> appreciate [ah] but
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
I seriously want that instead of <malay>macam pergi</malay> to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
<malay>gila</malay> I will just research about it later <malay>lepas tu nanti kita tengok</malay>
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
(mm)
that's why I say but okay [ah] okay [ah] it's a nice idea
then we can go for like normal outing also you know I feel like we should just
go out like normally
cause I felt like <malay>kita macam tak</malay> spend <malay>banyak</malay> time
<malay>yang macam</malay> cousins we don't really have much
time to spend together you got like
you working they working
I'm like I'm schooling all that <malay>macam</malay> all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to <malay>macam jalan-jalan</malay> together

since okay so what I'm planning to do is
we
we from this side from west side we bring food

so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
we are going to like have birthday celebration <malay>ni semua</malay> from
