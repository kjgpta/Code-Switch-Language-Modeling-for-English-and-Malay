okay what is he doing now
#khai#

(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
what
(mm)
he bailed
okay
ya
(hmm)
they just throw him in the office
and give him work to do right away
no training
[oh] my god
then he quit
like said goodbye to them or just
very what will be like so tragic like if you went then they might where the new guy
did the the manager or supervisor call him
ya
well ya
but then the part of the contract term is
[oh] is the just for this job is just for two month so there's no contract [lah]
then it's okay [ah]
then got
how much is he paid for this two month
!huh!
ya and he has it's office hours monday to friday
one point five
really [meh] okay [lah] my first
but not admin
no pay [lah] like he he he didn't even clock in the entire day is only one hour then he #zao#
wasted [sia]
ya what happened to the brooks brother
no the thing about her
[ah] I
last september
mid september I so I go home <malay>naik</malay> taxi right
then I already photocopy I need to fill up the form
for (uh) for claim any any kind of dates I need to fill up
I already submitted by end of (err) end of september
the end of september
and then some more my our pay is seventh of the month right so <malay>aku</malay> submit
<malay>aku</malay> submit like
seven or eight october
and then she say it will be in [ah] for november pay [eh] [ah] october pay [lah] but I will receive in november <malay>apa</malay>
then (uh) when I receive my pay in november recently I checked then I ask her [lah] luna I haven't received the claim that I was supposed to then she said [oh] is it let me get back to you and that is on six november
yesterday was twenty first right
twenty first november I texted her again I asked her hi luna is there any update about the claim
and she never reply
she never reply I can show you
I mean twenty five twenty five twenty five dollar and twenty five cent may be may mean nothing to you but
you see
when it come to this [one] she just disappear
ya
I mean come on [lah] I'm underpaid in the first place I know we're not supposed to share about (uh) our pay
but among our my colleagues all of us actually
talk about pay
yes
for me I'm just temporary there so I said I just said [oh] my paid is one point eight only
and then my another colleagues she also another temp staff she said my pay is one point nine
ya
then I said is it
then she just said maybe is your agent don't want to fight with I said I did offer a higher pay but she refused and she said [oh] the rejected don't want to pay any higher
is a shocking [lah]
because
to compare me and her
no her experiences is only from C K
ya
so it's not fair I I have
job experiences
from what retail from high end boutique
from H&M
bridal
so
I don't know how they actually
I don't know how they actually gauge the pay [ah]
maybe but job the thing about it is the job ad put two point two to two point four
and I actually put my expected salary as two point two because that's what the job said what job ad said my previous full time job I get two K [what] so
shouldn't you at least
ya follow up with the same rather than you know paying me lower
and then got one colleague she one year contract so her pay is one point nine same as a temporary staff one point nine [leh]
one year contract
so one year one year contract shouldn't she earn more because she
yes because
their workload is much more they have to do emails and then they have to do sales as well at the same time
maybe
and then there's new guy coming in right the one that replace
the bing for the ya that's the new guy
and then he go and say how much she got paid to my other colleagues that got paid one point nine
so <malay>dia pun</malay>
#peng# [ah] because <malay>dia tanya macam</malay> how much you got paid [ah] then after that [ah] he said [oh]
more than two point two less than two point five
you I mean
contract one year so same same contract as her so the workload is the same
experience wise ya
she has a diploma cert
he only stop until
from
#changi#
yes [ah]
yes
so is he he also worked there for two years sales only
no experience in terms of emailing or what this other colleague she even though
<malay>dia</malay> she just with what just graduated from poly
but her past past jobs her intern job are all related
cause she did events management so in term of <malay>macam layan</malay> customer and all she's quite good [lah] like when she draft email actually not bad like no problem in terms of grammar
so of course [lah] I understand why she is angry [lor] then
ya she got paid one point nine he got paid like two point four so that's like five hundred more [eh] four hundred more
yes
so one one point nine she brought home one point four [eh] one point six [ah] one point ya ya
<malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>entah macam bila dia datang kerja</malay> right <malay>sekarang dia datang kerja dia tak dia tak ada semangat</malay> ya demoralised I mean
wasted the cert <malay>macam tak ada guna</malay>
<malay>aku ada cakap aku cakap</malay>
[ah] <malay>suruh dia berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> manager cause confirm <malay>ada macam</malay> review <malay>apa dia dah habis dia nya tiga bulan</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> sometime manager <malay>aku tanya macam</malay> okay everything okay everything okay
so <malay>kalau aku cakap dengan dia</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> it bothers her so much
ask maybe
that one point nine is just <malay>kau punya</malay>
your ya maybe your trial period pay
even if it's not trial period right actually is by project
yes yes exactly I I mean I also don't know [lah] like try your luck [lah] then she said
no [lah] but then if I said it like that right surely my the manager will said you never read the contract properly
her fault
[kan] <malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>kasi dia</malay> scenarios [sia] like some ya you try [lah] you try talk like that
[kan]
<malay>kita kalau nak berbual kita tak boleh macam</malay> [ah] <malay>cakap pasal macam asal kita tak</malay> happy
yes cannot <malay>macam</malay> involve other people and knowing that they what what's their pay like because surely there is already breach of contract [pe] and the agreement
cannot [lah] [sia] I don't think the manager will even talk talk to us about that like she won't be comfortable discussing this matter cause is not his
liberty I means he's not the one that
gauge how much she should pay
he's not the one that agree
<malay>dia setakat</malay> hire [jer]
and do the interview
is the right
but that means she has go through
no
and then she said <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia takut</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau dia berbual gini</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> manager <malay>aku ke dengan atau dia berbual dengan</malay> <malay>ke apa</malay> or maybe the boss confirm after this <malay>dia kena macam pulau</malay>
confirm <malay>kena pulau</malay> [kan] yes <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni budak yang minta minta</malay> higher pay
sad [sia]
she is
because she's got paid the same as how much I've I've earning and my job is so easy [eh]
is just doing sale
no pressure no nothing
even though we don't get commission [lah] but still we are still doing our job
so it's <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
actually their their pay is is good [leh] for full timer
two point six
email [lah] I mean one thing about about that is
you have to do email while you're on the sales floor
is not conducive
is not conducive at all [lah] I I I when I see them doing email <malay>macam</malay> annoying
yes so can you imagine you are doing email <malay>abeh</malay> you you see customer coming right
then after that you have to stop doing your email you have to serve the customer
then after that when you go back to your email you forgot what what you want to say already
cannot like that what ya exactly like you need you need a space for you to really sit down and read your email
but this is not the case that's why when I see her <malay>macam</malay> one point nine is not enough [sia]
and during her off day also you still have to do work you know backlog
you have to update the you have to update the shit
saying which one which case or which customer case you handle and then you let's said the customer follow up or the retailer follow up you have to you have to continue you have to update
yes
yes that why is not that I don't want you to have the job but is just it doesn't justify the pay [ah]
yes and is not only that [sia]
<malay>macam</malay> it's like a chain effect
the big boss will be
the big bosses <malay>anuh</malay>
the another boss boss boss then after that go to manager then manager <malay>kena</malay> manager will go to us <malay>kena</malay>
yes
cannot you cannot said that
I I want to ya because I have four days leave [mah] I want to clear my leave
but if let's say
this year cannot applied already december somehow december there's already people on leave already
and december is the christmas period so you cannot already
good luck [ah] I I thought taking leave cause my contract end second february so first second and the last two days of january I take leave then I #zao# already [lah]
good right don't need [lah] for what
come back for what said goodbye
I don't have pass
is just uniform I can give them on my last day all clean ya
I don't need that or probably they ask me to wash after that I come back one full day one of the days to return the uniform
and pins
they don't they don't care
from what I know [lah]
hopefully like let's said I rather not take my leave and get paid
you know you get you can get paid right if you never take your leave
ya ya ya
but I'm sure they don't want to pay the extra
if one hour ten ten dollar
one day eight point five hour
so eight five eight five times four three hundred plus
I rather take that three hundred then taking leave
but if let's say I can applied leave
from
second last day of january then why not then I <malay>kira</malay> [kan] unemployed after that ya
no plan
actually
yes
no the thing is he offered me a
<malay>macam</malay> work with him [lah] is not work with him
but it's more like I design for him a collection he wants to come out a clothing brand
so ya but he wants me to
right
he wants me to design but he wants me to come out with the brand and and take it as my brand under his wing
then I said I I said to him [lah] <malay>aku aku cakap dia terus macam</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi kau yang ada</malay> design <malay>dia</malay> [sia] <malay>kau dah ada</malay> the inspiration in mind [tau] you already have the vision
then <malay>kau nak aku buat</malay>
the whole collection okay
<malay>tapi kalau kau nak suruh aku ambil kau nya</malay> brand I cannot
is ya is not my <malay>aku aku dah cakap dengan dia</malay> is not style then then it took him a while to understand why I
and very adamant about it [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
is not my brand I don't is like louis vuitton
yes that's a beauty director but there's still a designer for the fit right yes and staff like that so I told him that way then he he he finally agree to it then he said okay [lah] we see how we start out with one collection first
so then when I take over it I cannot work with #raki# anymore I don't know whether he confirm or not because there's no there's no update
but yup
<malay>tu aku macam</malay> okay [lah] I just accept his offer and is going to be next year so
