<malay>biasa</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ada kerja</malay>
<malay>tak apa</malay> if you <malay>nak</malay> I <malay>masak</malay> [kan] I think <malay>dapur tu terbakar terus</malay>
no serious okay maybe I'm not as bad as some people
cause [kan] I have a friend (uh) <malay>nama dia</malay> #amelia#
you know her [kan] ya you know her she tried cooking
I don't know what she was cooking [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia kasi bila dia kasi</malay> family <malay>dia makan</malay> [kan] <malay>semua kena</malay> food poisoning
no and then you know her mum was like hospitalised for a week
serious
I don't even know I think wait I think she was baking some sugar cookie <malay>entah</malay>
I think <malay>untuk raya ke</malay> [pe] but then I don't know what she put inside baking soda wait you do put baking soda inside cookies right
okay then I don't know what she put inside that poisoned her entire family but ya <malay>selain dari masak</malay> is there any other position I can do anything but cooking
I don't mind as long <malay>duit halal</malay> and it doesn't involve cooking or maths because I'm not good at maths I mean like if simple calculation <malay>saya boleh tapi</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> algebra <malay>tu semua mampus</malay>
okay [oh] my god thank you so much you know I've gone for so many interviews [kan] but then <malay>semua orang tak nak orang pakai</malay> hijab hijab <malay>atau melayu</malay> like there was this one tuition centre that I applied for they were like happy with my grades <malay>tu semua</malay> and then <malay>dorang dah dorang</malay> accept [tau] and then <malay>lepas tu dorang tanya</malay> like for my race [lah] and then like what language I speak <malay>tu semua</malay> then I was like [oh]
I malay and then I give him my full name then he was like [oh] I'm sorry but (um) the position has been filled so we cannot hire you then I was like bro you just mentioned not too long ago that you wanted to hire me then <malay>sekarang mentang-mentang</malay> I <malay>kata</malay> that
I <malay>melayu</malay> you don't wanna hire me anymore
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] and then like there was another company [ah] (err) it was an accounting company so I'm from (uh) I was from a media course then I have a media diploma then I went for this (um) digital marketing job and the person told me during the interview that I don't have the qualifications but in order to get a job at their company I need to be willing to <malay>buka</malay> my hijab
[kan] so I ask [lah] <malay>kenapa nak kena buka</malay> hijab and then they were like [oh] cause they deal with a lot of (um) western people western clients european people and these people they don't really like working with <malay>orang islam</malay>
because
<malay>pada diorang</malay> [kan] <malay>pemikiran dorang ialah</malay>
kita sebagai orang islam kan kita semua terrorist tu semua you know
<malay>kita orang jahat</malay> so <malay>kalau dorang nampak yang</malay> company <malay>ni ada pekerja islam pakai</malay> hijab <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang tak nak</malay> work with this company
and then the thing is the thing that upsets me the most is that they <malay>paksa</malay> the <malay>pekerja kat situ untuk buka</malay> hijab there's like <malay>dua ke tiga pekerja kat situ</malay> at first <malay>dorang kerja boleh pakai</malay> hijab [tau] then all of a sudden I think new management <malay>ke</malay> [pe] [ah] <malay>dorang kena terpaksa buka</malay> hijab cause <malay>kalau tak dorang kena buang kerja</malay>
and then you know [ah] <malay>sekarang tengah</malay> COVID nineteen <malay>nak cari kerja bukan main susah</malay> [kan] so those few workers had no choice but to <malay>buka</malay> hijab <malay>dorang kesian</malay> [seh] !wah! <malay>aku macam nak sepak</malay> [jer] <malay>muka dorang</malay> like [eh] bro what does us wearing a hijab have anything to do with our capabilities or anything my <malay>mak kerja dekat</malay> company <malay>besar</malay> okay it's a it's an american company that was bought over by a japanese company
and in this company my <malay>mak pakai</malay> hijab <malay>pun boleh naik pangkat tinggi</malay> [tau] you know and there's <malay>ramai orang islam kat situ</malay> in fact one of her receptionist just converted to islam
and they are okay with them wearing hijab so what is this small local accounting company so against <malay>orang pakai</malay> hijab you know I think that's just them being racist
<malay>menyampah</malay> [seh]
and it's not just in malaysia that <malay>orang islam boleh pakai</malay> hijab like there's a lot of countries out there that allows their muslim workers to wear hijab even though I have to admit [lah] singapore <malay>lagi bagus sebab</malay> the racism isn't really that obvious here but still though you know my I my (uh) #obek# [kan] she actually works at I don't remember which hospital but then she has to remove her hijab
and she's not even a nurse she's just what is she doing [ah] (uh) I think she was doing laundry ya so dude you are doing laundry you don't even have to face the people like the (um) <malay>orang-orang semua pesakit-pesakit</malay> so like why do you have to remove the hijab that's so stupid what does have wearing a hijab have anything to do with doing laundry I can wear a hijab and do laundry also
ya even though I hate doing laundry so heavy but ya and then like (uh) you know in malaysia the the women's army actually wears hijab
ya
which I don't want to do [lah] I mean I don't know about you but just walking ten minutes in hijab is enough to make me sweat and imagine having to exercise in hijab !wah! I did that in year one because okay in my school we have this (um) thing where all year ones have to do sports it's called sports for life
so (err) I was in what was it called squash [oh] my god I love squash it's like tennis but you just hit the ball against the wall and you can actually go blind for it ya but then the thing is [kan] (um)
I I was wearing I was already wearing a hijab [lah] in year one and then dude the warm up exercise consist of us running around doing push-ups squats and all that
I felt like dying it was so hot cause like not only was I wearing a hijab so not only was my head and my neck covered up but I also had to wear the sleeve and then so inside I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and then outside I was wearing the sports for life uniform and then I was wearing socks and all that !wah! dude it was like
it !wah! I felt like I was dying in the desert [sia] serious
that was how hot it was and there was only two fans in the court and then I wasn't even there was so many of us so I wasn't even anywhere near the fan I don't even know how I survived that I should have just joined yoga or something
no [lah] cause actually the reason why I joined sports [kan] was cause (uh) it was super cool to me like can you imagine playing tennis or whatever against the wall you don't have to worry about looking at other people in the eyes but then (uh) I found out that usually squash like in pairs [kan]
you have to be careful cause you can actually hit your partner with the racket and then like (um) you have to wear the face face gear or something cause sometimes (um) the ball will hit against you like when it bounce against the wall [kan]
then like (uh) then my my coach was like scaring us about how this player he didn't pay attention to where the ball was going then it hit him in the eye then he turned blind then I was like shit why did I even join this no that and
one of my crush was actually in squash
ya so so like when I found out that he was in squash I was like [oh] my god we can play squash together so I joined [lah] but then we ended up being in different groups
so
his group was in a different court <malay>sedih</malay> [seh] I <malay>susah-susah penat-penat belajar</malay> squash join squash but then <malay>tak sama-sama pun</malay>
and now he's with an older lady
so
[kan] [kan] I mean I don't remember but I think his new girlfriend is quite hot I guess so I guess I can see why he wanted to be with her but still like dude (ugh)
[oh] my god you know speaking of men I have one month like by the end of this month to find a guy
because

#diana# wants to set me up with her boyfriend's friend and her boyfriend I'm sorry to say this okay if you ever meet her don't tell her that I told you this <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] boyfriend <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>tak</malay> handsome <malay>langsung</malay>

[kan] like okay
I respect everyone's beliefs
I have friends who are atheist I have friends who are non-believers I have friends who are buddhist my family has christians and taoist and all that like my family is a mash of like different religions

I don't want to cause
<malay>dia fikir</malay> [kan] we were being match made [tau] so he's really into the idea like he told (um) #diana's# boyfriend and #diana# told me that he's really up for being match made with me [kan] that's that's how I reacted like like what with first of all I've never even met #diana's# boyfriend okay second of all we've never met each other I I deleted telegram
after he sent me that message and then I replied to him I deleted telegram so (um) I don't know if he sent me any messages [lah] I haven't re-downloaded it and I don't think I will anytime soon and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] (um) so #diana# <malay>kata</malay> (err) [oh] I have like my standard <malay>tinggi sangat</malay> [lah] I <malay>tak boleh pilih-pilih sangat tu semua</malay> so she's giving by the end of the month she knows where I live by the way
so she's giving me until the end of the month to find a guy or else she's going to like do her best to set us up and I don't want that
I'm <malay>segan</malay> too but I would rather be match made with a guy who is at least like who have something in common with me than with this guy you understand why when I send you his picture
ya when I find ya ya [oh] my god dude
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh] seriously do you know any guy like it doesn't have to be we don't have to be anything more than friends but I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend all my friends all my guy friends are in and they are either taken or seriously weird

ya so I wasn't interested in #ateeb# at all so (err) I told him like [oh] sorry man like you are a great friend and all but I don't think I can see you as anything more than a friend and then he he started spamming me so I just muted him like I felt bad for blocking him and we were in the same class and same clique
so I just muted him [lah] like [oh] I'm really sorry bro but I <malay>tak suka</malay> you so maybe you should just you know move on [lah] but <malay>kita lagi boleh kawan</malay> and then he was like okay then he stopped texting me then you know what he did
he spam
#zi qing# cause at that time #zi qing# was my best friend
he spam #zi qing# asking me to like asking her to get me to accept him <malay>tu semua</malay> and then it was like I don't know how many days he did that but then #zi qing# <malay>menyampah</malay> so she she she like scolded me [lah] like [eh] can you tell #ateeb# to shut up or not [ah] you know he keep on texting me and spamming me non-stop !huh! asking me to like get you to get together with him then like [oh] my god I don't even like him then because of that

and then he even asked me out but then apparently he like #zi qing#
so so everytime he ask me out like it was to buy stuff for #zi qing# or like to plan a date with #zi qing# then I was like bro what am I you know you ask me out you bring my hopes up and then like all for her you might as well just !wah! fuck I got friendzone so hard so many times man and then #ateeb# <malay>tak</malay> give up so apparently [kan] did you know this apparently #ateeb# spread a rumour and like a lot of people believed that I was dating #ateeb#
