because I was like damn pissed off [lah] cause he really thinks I'm like girls is just like so weak you know like I hate it because
that [one] I don't care [lah] like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me <malay>ke buang</malay> (uh) me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done [lah] and <malay>dia pangkat</malay> sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant <malay>punya</malay> rank [lah] so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did <malay>buang</malay> so whatever he did to me he will get back [lah] ya
we are basically like the black people
no seriously like white always have the privilege I mean guys always have the privilege
(mm) that [one] is damn sad [lah]
I can't really say much but ya whatever it is like try me whatever happens happens [lah] because I know how to save myself but then we see how it goes [lah] who knows things change we don't know but like I can just be brave that's what I can do I just ya put my mind into him
like because like I feel like I'm talking to you like you know just don't make anything bad happen to me okay
I don't know the way that is not like (err) being like disrespectful disrespecting [lah] I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> cause he's the one that create us [what] so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with #allah# like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like <malay>bukan macam</malay> [eh] <malay>lu macam muak</malay> no
that's exactly ya that is like <malay>ya allah tolong</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>buat macam gini</malay> you know like please [lah] please [lah] at least that [one] he knows <malay>macam</malay> because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>berbual maki ya allah</malay> you know that
kind of disrespecting ya but then no [lah] so far I never do that before I'm like always like you know I'm always very comfortable
[oh] my god
I don't know what is their motive though we never disrespect your god why must you disrespect ours
I think because they watch a lot of nuns [lah] how is it scary we are [oh] my god we are covering up what we can cover man nevermind they don't understand we at least understand our religion nevermind as long as we believe in what our god trying to make us do nevermind they don't understand they don't need to understand [lah] they don't have to also
if not just ask us [lah] about you know try to understand about our religion at least like okay [lah] explain us about good I explained ask about your god
just because we look scary !wow!
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those <malay>hijab</malay> people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear <malay>hijab</malay> and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant #blah# #blah# #blah# no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
like all those wannabes
same <malay>sama</malay> ya true true
(mmhmm) like not like not just saying that we are that old you know to the point where we can judge them like seriously this is you know
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect <malay>memang betul kita semua bukan</malay> perfect <malay>pun</malay>
so is like something is even <malay>orang yang</malay> very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes <malay>kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam</malay> [oh] !wow! <malay>kita aku rasa aku betul</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi orang lain tengok macam</malay> [eh] actually <malay>dia ni apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia buat</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>salah</malay> [sia] <malay>padahal sendiri fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>baik baik baik</malay>
<malay>tapi nanti bila dah</malay> live a long life already <malay>fikir balik macam</malay> like [oh] my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that [lah] like so <malay>sekarang</malay> for the <malay>mak</malay> and <malay>minah</malay> I feel sorry for them [ah] because they maybe <malay>tak dia kurang ajar</malay>
<malay>pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar</malay> so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a <malay>minah</malay> and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a <malay>minah</malay>
I can be any anyone [lah] like can just say I'm a girl with a lot of personalities
I can be a <malay>minah</malay> I can be a #mat# I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and #allah# give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to <malay>macam</malay> you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes <malay>kita tak macam</malay> we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but <malay>padahal macam pada kita</malay> is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to <malay>macam</malay> sugarcoat everything <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you are doing so great [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai hijab tak tutup</malay> (err) <malay>apa apa ni leher takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>lupa melayu sikit takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tak tutup pun takpe</malay> [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai tudung dengan</malay> sleeveless <malay>pun tak apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kau nak main bola pakai tudung</malay>
never heard of that but ya like <malay>semalam dah cakap</malay> [ah] it's like okay that kind of <malay>teguran</malay> is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like !wow!
[eh] example like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! #farah# so nice [ah] she everytime sugarcoat me ya but <malay>padahal</malay> #farah# itself is like
like I don't really mean that you know like I I'm just trying to sugar coat you because I want you to be my friend like that type you know so it's like people just don't know the difference
exactly (uh) like seriously I feel so <malay>malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri</malay>
(mmhmm) I mean they have like that self esteem okay fine that [one] I but then like that's too much [lah] know your limits [lah] no need to rub to our faces [lah] at least (mmhmm)
[eh] [oh] my god <malay>kalau tak jadi riak pun</malay> #allah# <malay>tak terima</malay> [sia] so #allah# <malay>sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat</malay> so the more you share to people <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak aku solat</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>lima waktu</malay> [sia]
okay then what you want me to do <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you confirm go to heaven [lah] what you expect exactly so is like [oh] my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite <malay>quran</malay> [ah] a lot of time <malay>macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau <malay>dah</malay> khatam belum</malay> like <malay>aku dah khatam</malay> [sia]
I'm like okay you can at least say like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kalau</malay> if your friends like haven't <malay>khatam</malay> and you have already <malay>khatam</malay> like at least two times three times you can just <malay>ajar</malay> that person <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>aku tolong kau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku bimbing</malay> [ah] <malay>apa aku akan jadi</malay> your guide [lah]
guidance okay so <malay>kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam</malay> K [lah] <malay>aku jadi cikgu engkau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku dah khatam banyak kali</malay> like you don't have to say that <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah]
like for example I haven't <malay>khatam</malay> you already <malay>khatam</malay> then I'm like I really want to <malay>khatam</malay> because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of (um) like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then #farah# came up to me like example [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) do you need help like <malay>kau belum khatam</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab aku baru khatam</malay> so <malay>kau perlukan bantuan tak</malay> at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay [ah] <malay>boleh tolong tak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like [oh] my god like <malay>memalukan gila</malay> [lah] <malay>serius serius</malay> like <malay>tuduh ke</malay>
