<malay>aku tengok</malay> drama [jer] the world of married
it's about this girl she's very successful <malay>macam dia jadi</malay> the associate director
of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her [ah]
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
in the first place <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> whether she
he really cheat <malay>dekat dia ke tak</malay> eventually [ah] she found out [ah] and about the girl and everything
then there's a lot of drama with the girl cause the girl <malay>macam</malay>
although <malay>dia tahu</malay> that he is a married man <malay>dia tetap nak dengan</malay>
that guy [ah] then that eventually
(um)
because the guy has always been <malay>macam</malay>
living off from her wealth
so <malay>dia</malay> the wife
was actually very very very
(um)
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
then but then in the end <malay>dorang</malay>
(uh) <malay>cerai</malay> [lah]
then <malay>cerai</malay> the the wife manage to take all her wealth back
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama [ah]
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage [ah] because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
(uh) you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this (uh) phrase
[ah] loving loving some falling in love is not a crime then I'm just like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
ya
but
now like the story I <malay>masih kat</malay> episode nine so like
(uh) they got divorce but then
the (uh) kay the son right is so irritating [seh] <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>besar pun dia macam</malay>
<malay>macam selenger selenger gitu</malay>
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
(um)
she like restrained herself
cause <malay>dia tak nak</malay>
<malay>anak dia ataupun dia tak nak macam</malay> involve
in this kind of thing again [ah] drama again
ya
(mm)
but then I heard that
I mean [lah] I don't know cause #Syamsul Yusof# has always been
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> how to say [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> rumours <malay>pasal dia</malay> like you know remember about Diana Danielle also
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love [what] like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore [kan]
because I heard that he stole something and everything
I mean he really got really really <malay>macam</malay> soul soulless again
but
I don't know [lah] how to say about him but I feel that he keeps on screwing things over and over and over again
[oh] wells
ya
ya
but
I don't know [lah]
[ah] up to him [lah] he celebrity [lah]
but you know (um) you know I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] if I want to do my hair tomorrow <malay>ke tak</malay>
ya the original price is about three hundred fifty [seh] and hundred fifty for three hundred fifty treatment
then right I see their steps like firstly they will like massage
then after that they will like put essential oil for you to relax then they will put something for your scalp then they wash
then after that they put like this
beads then they crush it then they put like the medicine the carotese medicine or what
then after that they steam
after they steam then (uh)
okay already like they blow dry
(mm) I like I mean I've booked for tomorrow but I don't know what time what time you going school [ah]

I have like about
two more one year plus
till I end my work
[ah] I <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak sabar</malay> [seh]
I never know why
well cause maybe you don't really get sense of security there like everyday it's like it's playing with your anxiety did you do something wrong or not
ya
why I mean like even if I were to continue my studies I don't think I'll be in the same school as you
is it cause you <malay>tak</malay>
(uh) used with your friends <malay>lagi kot</malay>
!huh! they you mean you don't #chiong# last minute [one]

but I thought yours is near the [one]
[orh]
then did they say hi
but [ah] Shein [kan] <malay>dia kena baik-baik</malay> [tau]
cause some of the stuff they are like over
overpriced or like they take from Shopee or something
[oh] my god you know like I've been searching for clothes [kan] then most of the clothes <malay>takde</malay> my size [seh] it's like I go to like
AforArcade I go for Modparade I go for Editor's Market actually Editor's Market maybe tomorrow I <malay>tengok</malay> cause
ya tomorrow [oh] my god ya so right I don't know [seh] what I I should like spend on cause I budget myself to only spend like three hundred
so like one hundred fifty gone
then maybe like fifty gone for transport and like nine thirty gone for
(uh) eat (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
and a fifty I mean like another hundred gone for eating
so that would be two hundred fifty then I mean I have like fifty dollars left
like what you cannot also buy [seh] fifty dollars
no I mean for the whole month
ya so confirm cannot save like that
I've been trying to save
that's true some more I pay for the bill and then pay for myself
!hais!
[oh] ya ya that's true
!hais!
a lot of mishap [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> this year
is it really <malay>susah ke</malay> whatever you studying
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay>
you like right what you doing
anyway I think [oh] my god ya then after that
I need to buy present for #Anas#
ya and I don't even know what type of taste or do they even have this
clothes but I thought I wanted to buy him body cause clothes <malay>susah</malay> [ah] for me I need to see his size all then later he cannot wear how
ya some more like clothes hard
cause I don't know whether he will like my taste
but he chose to wear it that's the thing it's
is it then <malay>tak</malay> [kan] I <malay>nak beli</malay> [kan] <malay>dia baju batik</malay> confirm <malay>dia tak beli tak pakai</malay>
no he won't wear purple he say Barney
what serious [ah]
[meh]
exactly he is
[oh] ya that's thing I <malay>takut tak muat</malay> cause
you know got like those like slim fit regular fit all then I don't know all this guy shit
ya that's why I thought just buy <malay>sapu</malay> [jer]
he can <malay>wangi</malay> himself
<malay>lagipun</malay>
that's the easiest
<malay>kalau beli</malay>
(err) clothes then you have to take into
size the design whether it fits
ya
but how is he [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
how is he coping now
in the new work and all
(mm)
<malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang suka</malay> act tough [jer]
!huh!
that's true
like long time <malay>tak jumpa dia</malay>
ya
(mm)
it's okay [lah] one day I see him [lah] slowly
(uh)
okay [lah] but maybe my next like three day off I ask him out
but then I scared he go dating [ah]
cause if he's free he will usually go dating [what]
do you like study math anymore no right
[eh] why you don't want to teach the our neighbour anymore [ah]
(mm)
because like I heard the kid is really struggling as well
ya and then like he needs to take next year and then
he skip his grades are doing really bad right now
so he really needs help
but for me personally right <malay>macam</malay>
for me <malay>mak dia tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>yang dia tengah</malay> struggle then like
<malay>mak dia</malay> just hantar <malay>dia</malay> to like those like
tuition centre
then it like didn't help him then she don't want to teach him also
then I feel that <malay>macam</malay> if you give up on your own son then what about
people outside [seh]
ya
but actually he's such a nice kid [seh] I kind of miss teaching them <malay>tapi</malay> I really <malay>takde</malay> time <malay>untuk dia</malay> !hais!
but he play with my soft toys
like when he was sick he hug
#Didi# the dinosaur
and stuff like that
like a little sick cause his mum didn't want him to skip tuition
[oh] my god I think was only fifty
ya last time you also got paid fifty right
no it was never seventy
it was always fifty #Erra#
ya that's why I stop
is like about ten [ah] eleven
or twelve dollar plus
<malay>satu</malay> hours
ya still not worth it
like I know [lah] I get it <malay>dia macam</malay> mentally draining to teach a kid
some more he's very naughty but
I don't know I just <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> I just really hope that he at least
make it to like
make it well
yes true
but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
primary school <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
ya
but
(uh) I don't know [ah] it's like you know like how this kind of drama always happen then teachers will talk about it I just feel that the teachers should just stop talking about it <malay>macam dorang</malay> like to pry open to
people private affairs [seh]
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> feeling of a good
relationship I mean
<malay>dengan</malay> teachers
ever since primary school secondary school and days
because I feel that the teachers all <malay>macam</malay> #kaypoh# you know like during my right
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex [ah] my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell (um)
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students [seh] but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that [seh] and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
I <malay>tak suka</malay> [seh]
so traditional
I don't know [lah]
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
!huh! it's not it it's not
<malay>kita tak pernah lambat</malay> I always <malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
I <malay>pernah lambat</malay>
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no [lah] sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then [oh] ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
then I say [eh] I injured <malay>mesti pakai</malay> ankle guard colour black cause last time we need to wear white socks right
then I'm like [eh] you want to pick fight with me cause of this <malay>merepek</malay> [seh]
don't know
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay [lah] whatever you young but never mind [ah]
but she cannot handle the team well [seh]
she <malay>lepas</malay> [kan] at us so many times
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
at the she was looking <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums [seh]
I remember so many people vomited [ah]
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what [eh] I remember she do the stupid like
(err) push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
<malay>abeh</malay> like we all felt like dogs [seh]
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know [ah]
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
(err) the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
I remember there was this girl <malay>dia macam</malay>
like quite <malay>berbadan</malay> then like she was so <malay>semangat</malay> to go training then after that training I never see her face again
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
[eh]
ya I think I brought the trauma when trauma with me when I <malay>masuk</malay> [ah] <malay>bola</malay> [seh] <malay>masa</malay> I seventeen <malay>kat</malay> cause after that right I <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop [seh]
and like I I feel it's not normal
like before every match <malay>pun</malay> I very <malay>macam</malay>
nervous <malay>semua</malay> you know
!huh!
<malay>tapi</malay>
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
I feel that <malay>dia macam</malay>
help to
discipline us and make us stronger [ah]
cause imagine <malay>kalau kita tak buat</malay> sports [eh] <malay>kita</malay> confirm <malay>tak nak gi lari semua</malay> [seh] cause I see some of my friends <malay>yang tak masuk</malay> sports [kan]
