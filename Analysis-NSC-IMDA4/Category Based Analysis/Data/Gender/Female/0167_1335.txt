it's so long since I've seen you
so how are you
[oh] really
how is it
[oh]
[oh] !wah! not bad [sia] the job like quite chill for me I've been like searching for jobs because like <malay>susah</malay> [lah] like I don't know if what I should do with my life right now because I I'm contemplating between like design <malay>atau</malay> like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya because like I I wanted to go uni right but I didn't get in so I will try next year but for now like I need to find a job so is quite difficult [lah] because of the pandemic also it's like (uh) it's like very limited with the jobs so (hmm)
[oh] [ah] cashier job
[oh] that no that one temporary I mean they did ask me to extend [lah] but I it's not something that I want to do for like a long term you get what I mean ya ya cause like cause I work you know at there right like as the cashier so have to deal with like a lot of like like for you [lah] your one is also elderly right then
ya we also have to deal with a lot of elderly like for example like [ah] we got we got the you know the senior senior discount right on like certain days so I think it's ya no no no it's (uh) like (uh) for the elderly citizens like those sixty years old and above right if they buy their groceries on like for example wednesday they get a discount
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of <malay>bila nak apa itu bila nak bila</malay> got the discount right so (um) sometimes they will pick a fight [lah] but like (uh) (uh) I'm used to it already they will be like [eh] today don't have the discount [meh] you sure or not ya then I like (uh)
ya so that's why I'm not working there anymore because it's quite difficult
right [oh] really [ah]
as in she working [oh]
[oh]
ya [eh] she working as cashier also [ah] (mm)
[oh] my god <malay>kesian apa</malay> like I okay [lah] because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the (uh) aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
(um) I think I got make like a few mistakes [lah] once because I was just new what then I like had to do the cashier all by myself right because usually at the start right they the aunty will be beside you to help you so like after like a few weeks right then [ah] you have to do the cashier part alone
so ya then I got make a few mistakes like like something to do with the money [lah] I mean ya then after that (uh) the manager and the supervisor didn't scold me so I guess that's good like they were very nice about it ya even though it was ya
ya [lah] we need to pay back ya we need to pay back but like below five dollar don't need to pay back but if above five dollar need [lah] ya but so far never [ah]
[oh] ya got this one point of time when I was just new then like I was doing with the aunty [lah] so apparently like I think I miscalculated [leh] then got like a shortage of like ten dollars you know like ten dollars or more
ten dollars more ya because I think was fifteen dollars so five dollar offset right and ten dollars she need to pay well I I was supposed to pay [ah] cause I think I was the one that did the mistake [lah] then after that my aunty insist that she will pay for me so I felt so touched by her ya because they they're all very nice there ya ya I think it depends on the outlet [lah]
ya
[oh] my god
[ah] so nice luckily the uncle
ya I also got something like that because [ah] in we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right <malay>dia orang</malay> tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
so ya I don't know if it's like some of them may be on purpose or what [lah] but okay maybe there are others who really not on purpose then sometimes the card will have a error like they will say try again or payment not accepted or something so that means
like that means the <malay>apa itu</malay> the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
[ah] pay on the spot right then the machine cannot use like ya so that's why is like we have to be like attentive [lah] also but also some of the customers like I think [ah] some of them are like purposely like never pay then they just walk off ya
ya ya cause some some of like okay [lah] the one that time cause I work with sophia right then she had to pay like how much [ah] eighteen dollars like she had to pay ya because the customer walk off then like she cannot find a customer
ya ya luckily only eighteen [sia] imagine if the person buy like hundred dollar plus or what !wah! that one is like is like one week pay [leh]
[oh] ya okay I wanted to talk about the the ya wait what's her name #fadreena# is it #fadreena# so you met her from right the try out
(hmm)
[oh] no okay wait so my friend [ah] I don't know if you know her [lah] is she's the one that wear the hijabi she I mean hijab the she's my secondary school friend [lah]
so apparently she and the #fadreena# they are in the same course I believe it's ya same course but they are not classmates [lah] so apparently (uh) my friend she went to japan that exchange program with the school right
then <malay>lepas itu</malay> (err) this girl #fadreena# (um) I think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay [lah] I ask her to come join her also I mean join them as well so at first it was like okay [ah]
then after that the few the next few days [kan] (um) the #fadreena# was like getting close to my friend's friend so like there were times when they would just like she would like go into the hotel room right
and then asked the friend to like <malay>teman</malay> her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately [ah] then after that right my friend was alone [lah] like she was left alone [lah]
then like [ah] the japan trip also like she was the #fadreena# was like very like I don't know like the vibes of her was very off and then like they cannot click because I think also #fadreena# like I don't think you know her much [lah] but her personality quite strong
ya then there was this one point of time I think they were like making fun of each other [lah] #fadreena# and my friend then because [ah] then like she they I mean she said something hurtful about my friend like say (uh) I forgot what [ah]
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short [mah] so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt [lah] then she my friend like we like how to say [ah] (err) like she <malay>kena</malay> back my she <malay>kena</malay> back #fadreena# then #fadreena# not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like (ugh)
very bad from then then [ah] [oh] ya recently cause that time I met with her so the my friend #naziha# right she said like the #fadreena# sent her a long long text
saying like (um) what [ah] why you go around behind my back saying about me and all that when the last time they talk right was like two years ago because that that the the japan trip was like two years ago [mah]

I I don't know some of them say it's she rented the condo but I don't know she can also be she is staying in a condo [lah] basically
ya
ha-ha ya
no (uh) ya then they say like (uh) apparently I think either one of the mother or the the boyfriend was taking drugs then it's can also be like the cause of why they killed the child because you know when <malay>bila kau ambil</malay> drugs right then you won't like know what you're doing that kind of thing
ya so that's why
!wah! so sad [oh] my god I cannot [leh] cause you got see or not if you scroll down below right you got see the <malay>gambar</malay> of the child
