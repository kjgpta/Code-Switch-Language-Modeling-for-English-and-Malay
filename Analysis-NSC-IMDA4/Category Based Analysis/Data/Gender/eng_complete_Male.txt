eh Nads</P2 I haven't seen you in a long time ah
me too ah like as usual ah you know
so like okay ah so I know you recently came back from Australia ah how was it ah Nads</P2
mm
mm right right
then like
what what you study over there ah like in Australia
uh uh
mm
ya ya alright
me what school
now I in ah
Singapore Poly ah that's
mm
so like okay so
err for like my third year kan
need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job ah
so like
ya that's why ah cannot ah you know
for me I don't know ah we usually we like homesick ah you know so I go
on overseas
ah
uh I haven't pick yet ah any yet
club activities kan so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
mm
ya
mm
okay ah I find floorball quite interesting ah like
but like honestly it's not something I like ah as a sport ah you know if
uh sports ah I will definitely choose something else ah
maybe like okay so for they got clubs ah
okay so you know got different schools right
then you got my school lah called the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs ah
so my one is uh club
uh interview eh um when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply kan then I went for the interview
ah that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like walao eh
ah
ya that's why
ah that's why mm
ya ya true ah it's okay lah
sports
clubs ah I think clubs can ah but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can ah so possible
kay
so like for you kan Nads</P2
your school what what course you take ah for you I know you are in year one but what course ah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
then what are the modules you will like learn
mmhmm
mmhmm okay
ah
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me lah cause I got experience in secondary school kan
ah like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is uh about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A ah you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun ah for me
really enjoy ah cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun lah
ya
ya
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three ah is where like the interesting part lah
cause no no no before the internship kan
what ah the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine uh fuel system you know so like for us uh students right before we go for internship right you must understand ah all these kind of uh machinery how it works
cause if we just go for uh what ah
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills ah before our internship
oh what also ah
oh ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this mm
eh they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
uh
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like uh as the water level rises so it's about five minutes ah it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the okay eventually the water level will rise lah but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast ah ya
ya
ya that's why
that test ah honestly I haven't experienced yet ah cause I only year two now ah but something I look forward to ah
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or err what you call the inspector lah so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into lah like that ah ya
ya hopefully ah mmhmm
not bad ah not bad ah
spend a lot of time playing game ah
oo shiok ah I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
mm so something ah
something to kill time also ah in secondary school you know
then for you eh your free time what you normally do ah
mmhmm
mm ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what got any I join right then for you eh cause like you know you are like
uh year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any for your poly have or not
legit ah
mm
mmhmm
oo
mm
so okay ah based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first ah cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a like promoting for you to join right so you go see lah which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
so maybe you can make it to what uh Temasek poly uh floor ball team ah who knows ah
ya who knows who knows but I know the floor ball team very competitive ah
know
see which one you like the most y'know
oh
today ah I just finished my
last paper you know today
uh got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one one two hour paper
oh my goodness legit
so much to study
okay ah hopefully hopefully ah hopefully hopefully can pass ah
but then ah after the paper like
for what ah
it's for like
for my
infection ah or it's like how to say it's like a pimple lah you know in a sense and it bleeds ah so I have to go for appointment ah

advising on the surgery
like okay ah
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery ah cause like I'm only eighteen kan

cause this surgery is it's like
quite risk ah quite high risk ah
have to like what cut open that one put me on anaesthesia
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
uh pull a skin
so I cannot imagine ah a'ah
ah confirm painful sia legit

three doctors in the room ah then they wanted to inspect the you know you know
the wound
then I like quite scared ah then they start pinching pinching the wound then a lot of like the

you know when you're like kay now

then there is like you must start studying right you know do you ever like procrastinate when you want to study
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
for me ah I also procrastinate lah like you know I prioritize my err playing games over doing work ah my assignments ah
very close right then I'll start doing ah
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time ah you know because if
kan like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me what so I obviously have to start on doing ah
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over ah then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it ah you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle ah this issue of procrastination cause like
always ah since secondary school ah
always prioritise my games over the
mm wah
damn
ya it is hard lah but you know we must lah you know
it's very hard lah then okay like okay
through I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
ya group projects like that
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
wah
mm
mm
okay
me ah okay I have ah okay recently
social innovation project ah uh ya
I think combined with
uh different types of uh people from different courses ah so like
uh
to do a project together so basically this like
what is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry ah
so equips you with this kind of skill lah but let me tell you something ah I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you ah
cause like err it's damn rabak I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like walao eh why why got so much workload ah ah I don't want do ah like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
ah
like this
ya
ah then okay okay this one ah it happen like
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal ah for our presentation slides
then these guys right
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate ah
then
oh then they say eh why like that we you the only malay just come lah then I say how can like that I holiday what hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
oh my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining ah keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school designs right
or like do some drawing design kan
ah alamak legit I tell you I don't want ah but it's okay lah
ya but overall I think it's a good experience lah
cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together ah
and also ya it's good lah so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made uh okay you know for our project our aim right
to help people with depression integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely kan
ah they are like damn lonely right
alamak why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use ah then we decided to come up with something interesting for them lah cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
uh our the depression app ah counter
Pikachu ah Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
kay so what's so special about this tab right
uh when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app kan they can uh what ah uh
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual controls right so when they talk then they type right say uh how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
mm it's it's quite cool lah honestly
and also err
you can also prompt for
uh real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one uh what uh questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool lah ya
ya um and also for our app right uh we also put what ah
uh since like most of us like like to game ah like we
most um people like to game like they download apps for what
uh games right
for most people right then
ah our app introduces like some mini short games ah so you got heard of uh what kind of games ah err like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
ah Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
some mini games ah like also we put uh animal crossing ah concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
um
games for the user to play with ah which makes our app interesting ah
ya a lot of people ah
mm
ya so our app
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
ah
what ramen or some like cookie eh
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon ah which is I think quite cool ah so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to ah ya
forward to ya
so that's about it ah for my module interesting ah
mmhmm
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong uh
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two ah
ya semester two ah
it's called err
ah communicative I can't remember ah what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
uh improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach ah like one of them is ah time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance ah it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right kan do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what ah
what's that ah
oh your interview skills ah
for interview
he teach us uh the basic questionnaire ah like how to prep ourselves for interview
err what should we ask during an interview you know how to properly answer an interview
so I think is quite that one ah manageable
ah
ya
ya
so I respect ah for doing that
y'know
like I always stutter you know but like how in the future how are you gonna present yourself like why why would the company want to pick you over other people kan
so you have to present yourself better
so which is what this module is teaching ah
how to how to out
outstand ah among the other other interviewees ah
ya
so it's quite good lah since
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm then okay

and my course right the worst thing right is that people of my age right don't have you know like there was only one or two most of them were like two or three years older than me you know

it's kind of like a more singaporean Reddit kind of thing
have you still been using Reddit lately
vikings

thinking of buying what assassin's creed or
but
eh
but do you play the first few assassin's creed series
brotherhood I don't really remember playing eh no I don't think I finished brotherhood I played two
I think I was the one who told you to play two right was it

I don't know actually I don't know what around bugis is ah
ya never mind ah
I not interested anymore
I don't know
I think I need to translate this page ah

I don't think they were pirates or something lah I think you I think you
anyhow only ah
are you googling
are you googling uh malay pirates or something
uh huh
are you on the must share news dot com that one the seven facts about bugis people
why
ya ya ya there's something about pirates ah okay lah this page is in english so its a bit easier to
the boogeyman is out to get you
the the bugis man uh
that your ancestors were pirates ah
I don't know sia
uh huh
eh so you actually contemplating on putting a tattoo of a pirate ship on your thigh
orh but like of all the things a pirate ship ah that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something uh
ya
sure sure
the spur of the moment that kind of thing eh
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through lah huh
but you would think
huh
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of angmohs
but the angmohs were like you're you're so cool
ya lah he working at some burger
on the arm
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
uh huh
orh I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people ah
brand tattoos for her friends that kind ah
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first lah
ha
actually
ah like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part lah
I think like this is what tattooing feels like ah
you see how it feels ah
like getting injections over and over again
okay lah I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast ah
like really rapid
uh huh
uh huh
was that on impulse also or what
uh huh
uh huh
that your sisters what
oh ya ya
uh huh
uh huh
oh
okay lah so anyway it's kind of like fated ah that you
weren't supposed to get that tattoo ah
or do you like keep it all from her
then her friend is like the party kind ah
oh
orh so they know what you are up to lah
are you gonna go mexico do you have any plans to go mexico soon

ah
uh huh
but you don't remember ah
ah
not like the hit up other girls kind of satan ah
mm
uh huh
dude you remember or you don't remember
okay lah I guess it turn out for the better lah huh
well I just I just finished my reservist today also ah
never sia
then
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes ah more like it
ah
half was that half was
half was like
so they were
that was the other half lah the other half was
but ya other than that
err what time ah
like
uh ya
ya
orh
ah
sia
oh then my medical call
not bad ah
quite interesting ah
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill lah yes ah okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
then we reached the lift lobby
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
err are you the one who called just now then the guy was like ah ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he oh his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is uh pretty rare ah to to to see like shocks getting given by the ah
ya but the guy
uh huh
oh
orh but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping ah
I I think so
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
oh
compulsory to what
oh serious ah
ah
uh huh
okay lah I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay lah that guy quite nice the the community responder
cause he was at home ah he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
uh huh
ah
ah
so from from no breathing no pulse ah
oh ya that guy
uh huh
uh huh
confirm gone ah is it
uh huh
got the what again
ah the the one and two and three and four and that kind ah
ah
wait that was a doctor ah
it isn't you know
sian sia
who gets to do as in nobody want to do oh nobody wanna do
why sia
uh
huh
but uh
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also lah so he was saying that
cause
orh
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is lah but like
no point
oh
so can what
huh
ah ya ya the ugly one lah
oh
ya ya
oh ya I ding was telling us lah
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the lah recall
ah
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
oh
mm mm
okay ah
cause I came also like
then go up
but okay lah fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress lah cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no lah but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya lah definitely sia
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge lah but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the ah take charge
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
but now makes sense ah
ya
and fire bike
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
oh
uh huh
eight people
wah
oh
but wonder how often it's actually being used lah in
ah
ah
eh my friend from paya lebar also the madam told them don't turn out sia
they said they want to minimise
ah they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
ah fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I suay ah my
ya sia
don't know ah apparently it's the first time ah that
only the
they said because of the or something ah
but I don't know ah not really buying it
okay ah bo pian ah just go ah
then they also all the all the people were like
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
ya so it's called double meaning ah
so like
ya lah so must just be extra alert
okay lah but as in bishan usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
not bad lah at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay lah interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
ya
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different sia
what didn't you download the app
ah
uh huh
I think for you all different lah cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay ah
download what
oh no lah I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
oh the card ah
oh for a as a reservist ah
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
uh huh
uh huh
what did I what did I teach you
oh
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
uh huh
oh I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected ah
oh ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know ah
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
uh huh
uh huh
that one they are not choking already ah
huh
ha
in case anything happen like just cover your back ah is it
orh
oh so she wanted to go to the hospital ah
huh
something lah you feel like you are contributing it ya
oh
ha
huh
so you were already were were you there on the scene already ah for this
that was that was was that you
orh wasn't you ah ah
wah yesterday they were telling me like
err ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
ya ya that one that one
then
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
that you can close
ah so like
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
then he like
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
then which doesn't make sense because
but he climbed downstairs
then door open then he like he told them ah what he saw
then the two people outside like eh
but we didn't even close the door sia we just like we just held it ajar
ya that's the
as my my my call
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
ya
then what you doing tomorrow
ah
uh huh
oh so you buying for yourself lah
orh
ah
oh
ya I
I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen kan
then I I was having headaches like every week
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
oh shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
err
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing
cause I was googling it's called photo

right
yup
how old is your daughter now
oh my god you see
you see
it's ah it's he's a it's
he's turning two this coming december so that is how long that I've not seen you
and the the irony is that you only live like two blocks away from me
just after kindergarten okay no no no no no no no no no because if you remember correctly right for the longest time
yes we just performed our buttocks off ya and you remembered in her house there was like there's there's like
a mini stage where she you know it was in like her I don't think that is her living room her house her flat was quite big
ya lots of memories there but very err blur
vague
cloudy ya ya you can use the word cloudy because it's err
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me lah
yes ya
ya but at the same time I was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
in front of people
and then after that the
so
ya ya you were you were it
I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay lah the word is forget ladies and gentlemen um
manufacturing
right no no no continue no no no ya
this was another traumatising part err on my end
I guess so ya I guess so
oh ya ah we were kids we were
just stop lah like whoa
ya but you know
right
hmm oh my god
forced that's the word
you know what I felt the same way about you
and
what
oh my god I remembered
right
right mmhmm
mmhmm
we ya
I remembered
then we were doing oh and you know ya that was
we were very very happy
right
oh ya

yes I remember that part also and another thing which I also remember was that err
brother john
no
love
brother brother love
mmhmm
ya eh same ah
right
okay
you
I mean you are very positive
what
right right right right right I I feel that I feel that you are trying not to raise up that that that whole thing about you know fat people are lazy or whatever ya I err
yes err I mean my mum is quite
fat and I love her and my dad loves her very much you know err ya she's been quite fat for
quite some time

as in to to do his exercises right
and he will do the the simple exercises with the stretches no I I did introduce him to yoga but I I don't think he's interested in that
ya he starts to like cycle so
like I'm actually happy for him you know because
I guess I mean
ya so um um he will be one of those and hopefully he be going strong you know like for a few more years lah
ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him
what do you mean
ya
ya
not say active lah like I am not interested in the whole thing I I I don't know maybe because I'm like you know I like it's weird because okay

shah rukh khan uh and then uh what's that some of the bollywood's
uh actors and actresses
uh I really want to I really want to watch them ah
uh how about you
oh
ya I think that one also I I I really adore uh I really
interested to to see a lot of uh sharks ah

uh the fee ah to go to go inside
and dive together swim together with the fish
ah you and your brother lah
ah both of you can what was that I can put on uh scuba diving uh I think I just
if you can really swim together with the sharks eh

that time you watch what what movie
at the bedok cinema
you cried
ah movie
wah
this one what ah japanese eh
oh japanese story but they what they voice into what
orh the subtitle orh how how many viewers
orh
ah
but then quite a sad story ah I I don't wish to watch that kind of story ah
uh can watch lah old people cannot watch lah
why why why not they um
uh what was that revive uh superman's life eh
if a old time uh superman eh I think I will watch ah
I I I I prefer superman other than any other Marvel
ah heroes ah
uh what was that uh superman uh
powerful character ah compared to other marvel heroes ah
mm
hulk also
eh
ah right
ah ah
so last time when I watch hulk eh last time eh uh series eh they no no no nothing
ah there was actual visual
I like uh I like the the series very much ah those days ah
superman uh hulk
ah
which to me it's it's not
really accept so much lah we prefer normal
I mean natural visuals ah
mm
ah sorry
okay lah I I also appreciate uh movies lah
those time also I watch true lies
uh what's that uh movies rambo also
uh but
arnold schwarzenegger uh rambo
ah sylvester stallone
uh I think these movies really make my day ah
and ah for me I like adventurous and not so violence ah
I like adventurous ah and then also
I like to watch fairy tales movie
uh as well like cinderella
snow white
uh I think
uh I I prefer to watch this this kind of fairy tales ah
uh
ah should be no problem ah kan
uh I I think uh
ah we can go there what
ah
I can try baby pool first ah
or you can try deep pool also what
ah I I I think I think we can try ah swimming
you can try your skills
no it's it's quite uh no uh wasted tau
if you you know how to swim you better use use your skills
correct not so this time round you can use the deep pool don't worry lah maybe can we we we we can try slowly
alright then after that you can uh sharpen up your your your your swimming your swimming skills
then after that we can go east coast
ah
so east coast you were to go deeper or you want to go to the shallow
uh and then how how uh and then how you get how you got the way how you run away
he carried you ah okay lah so so
oh but then
uh you sounded not okay lah but then end end up okay ah
okay lah should be no problem lah
so so so hopefully so uh you what's that in sec one sec two you you had
uh several
uh practices kan ah I think should be should be okay
ah
practice
ah
ah
so if you go to east coast maybe we can take a shallow one ah
ah slowly
ah so gradually we can we can really do lah correct or not
I mean it's a waste ah
you can uh we will just we we we we send you to go swimming
uh swimming courses and then after that end up
you cannot swim I mean you are afraid to swim ah
ah
bedok swimming pool
ah pity ya actually actually I want to try also
how to swim also
uh
it's not I'm scary it's not I I'm I'm too scared ah actually I also can practise also
ah
so so so I I I think I can I can practise if I practise I can better become better than you ah
ah
so be beside swimming what's your what's your other fear ah height height is it
oh okay
okay okay
even though it took uh long longer time for you to to complete the course
did someone help you along
so this I want to ask did anyone said ah ee ishraf don't don't take longer time ah you
ah was that you you spoil the whole course ah
okay thank you bye

eh then you pass by so fast eh
don't you think so like with COVID like wow where did all the time go
ya
miss travelling eh do you miss travelling
ya but if mm you could pick a destination where do you think you will travel to uh
um like before COVID lah
new
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van wah love those time seh
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way lah you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van wah that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places lah
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya eh you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
eh but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience eh
oh my god
serious eh
okay okay okay
eh but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
mm
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match ah so my cousin and I didn't keep up
ah K
oh okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K lah at least you were sort of prepared for it lah to happen
I don't know what's nice over there
err melbourne was quite nice right eh or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it ah
like it was like an um
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
ah my god super super shiok
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
wow like that's an experience you won't get here seh
ya lah ya lah that's true lah
ya
ya yes
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also lah
ya more more expensive places err like
those I don't lame places lah like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
eh but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless what
that's true
eh but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know selangor pass selangor
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun eh but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that ah to get to thailand by car
yes yes definitely need to stop in lah like I need my dose of man
ah
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
oh ya never thought of that ah
ya ya ya ya correct correct
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling lah
we drove that camper van right and then we got through err got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice what
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck ah to explore the ferry kan
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it lah
ya correct
ya correct
ya eh you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
I don't know if you do lah but that's just me
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh wow I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know ah oh it's just damn different ah or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
ya
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had err more like
ya but if I had to pick
amorino K amorino is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and messina for the range
ya I think
ya because but wow messina has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
ya
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything ah
gelato messina ah hands down ya
ah what what do you call it mm what was it like yuzu and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya mm
eh and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce wah best seh
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
ya best donuts seh
ya
mm
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
oh ya that's eh so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
uh I think it's the donut itself ah
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like wow oozing out ah
correct correct ya
like honeycomb custard or something wow
wow like mind blowing seh
ya that was interesting ah ya
eh what what was that like curry curry eh
ah thai green curry eh
I I remember I remember there was something like um
ah plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice lah
oh to like caramelized the whole thing ah is it
that was also like a random find right
ya
oh K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually um in dragon's den as in
ah okay okay okay
ya
like you know when we were craving for
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant prata over there lah
ya but ya lah I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there lah
mm
what what what what do you miss
okay okay
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like um things on the menu
a pie pie face
ya that was nice also
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember ah
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess ah I guess
ya
of course lah we had to what
ya
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there ah even though it's in a thousands
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot ah
and because those factory outlets kan have everything under one roof tau
bicester kan bicester
bicester
we were so noob man
oh and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain kan yes yes yes
eh it's a once in a lifetime chance seh we never know if we are going to pass by that place again lor
trying to recall lah
err
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
enchanted garden or something
no no no it's not luge
fifty eh
fifty sing ah
ah okay eh what what else was it that we did over there
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then um
ya I just remember that that thingy ah what is it called ah
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to lah eh but the beaches there were nice eh
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
mm we really miss the nature ah
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya eh but malaysia nature not bad leh actually
ya
mm
no lah you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya but okay lah I mean like okay langkawi has nice beaches
okay lah it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can ah while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have uh know two thousand maybe
wait what did you go to spain for
oh
eh but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
and then
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare ah
huh
so basically you were trying to catch your train err trying to catch your flight you mean
serious
oh my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
mm
okay okay and like the timing wise
okay no cash on hand lah you mean
okay
mm mm
uh huh
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
oh I see like how much it's supposed to cost ah
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
oh wah were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him lah
mm
start of an adventure eh
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
eh wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
ya ya like uh
mm mm
mm
oh I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
mm
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
mm
okay
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the prata was huge
then
oh
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
ah okay okay okay
I see I see
yup
oh
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me lah I've never I've never encountered this before so
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees ah it's just the shoppers will probably be like ah what are we going to do now at such an early time like uh we still want to shop
oh K K eh what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
mm
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay lah not a lifelong dream but

I I don't really wanna work at plaza singapura

pakistani
oh didn't pop the bubble
like ask ah like the great old city they want people
converse
all is like given ah
I will be so early there nothing to do
right that's why I need
the job
sixty dollars no I cannot I I cannot I'm saving that money to book the to activate my account back like for my grab stuff E P
I mean like that is what I have been doing
I mean like it works for a little while I mean like it works like when I had
the K S P money the government money the government grant it work lah I keep my
my money all there
is like I don't think I want to show my face lah you know the korean pictures like the
should I put my phone here
I mean I don't think I want my legs
like this
I am
okay
I don't I don't want a lot of greens actually
not really like maybe like see the
or something like
I don't need to be full lah
I just wanna like because I don't have make up
ya but like
you know how the korean pictures look like
like singapore but not singapore you know
you know I know you know
is it okay duh
oh okay maybe nearer ya
so like black and yellow black and yellow you know little bit fuck
okay
so funny
okay like this it's so hot
okay I should try editing it with light room
oh look like
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
oh
okay
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
but you can learn ah it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so I love it sia no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much how much filter how much um you edit ah
the higher your
your saturation err contrast and all that right
the worst the the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less
ya
that's why that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of um effect and then like the effect you put how high it is ah technically
kan and that's what my photographer friend said ah and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
oh is my card with you
okay
mm
ya same as you right
oh
eh but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take what
like if I end before eleven forty five
mm
but will that minus off like my pay
oh okay that is nice
mmhmm
it just enough time for me to take home lah
so like can I have to go back to orchard
oh oh the stop the bus
then I stop at dhoby ghaut
ah
uh huh
nice I mean at least better than Smiggle
ya why why would you even put like six cents
they say they want to increase my pay after like
whatever whatever but they didn't even do that
I'm so tired what the shit
okay I can't wait to watch my Netflix
brams no
no no it's a it's a K drama about like classic music classical music mm
no actually K dramas ah korean drama they usually end after episode sixteen
the longest it'll be twenty six or like thirty eight
right right
hmm
that's me that's me when I watch scarlet heart ryeo I was so sad ya I mean like scarlet heart ryeo was more than twenty episode I think
oh my god it was so good kan then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then ee
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
I mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood lah because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner like commoner
ya you like the ya the head servant that kind and she became like that like a royal something ah can't remember
is a nice show
like I'm so sad
I heard they make a chinese version of it
that is the thing
kan oh ya I saw
drama the goals are eh like meh
oh you know I watch I recently watch this chinese drama my unicorn girl and then
the the lead actor was the guy from meteor garden
like the chinese the china chinese or china version I don't know ah

ya ya ya ya
I understand ya

ah
ya
yup yup yup
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective uh a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think uh it's quite it's it's something that uh there I I would I would um and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn lah
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
for me
oh right
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
oh definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
ah no no it was a academic uh more of a academic kind of uh mistake lah uh I mean it was a academic um how to say ah misstep which which I could have my my my um my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science ah which means then after that err the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was uh just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six ah I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit ah when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis ah so I had to remove my appendix because err it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had err not err what err gone to the hospital lah uh if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication uh in which this this uh operation actually made my stomach lining weak
uh because they have to cut they have to cut through mah so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my err my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another lah basically so it was first it was an appendix then uh it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical eh in a medical sector your intestines uh usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
uh apparently that can be fixed okay err and and basically what happens is uh if you fix it uh generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
this this this this uh this condition but um the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and uh hopefully hopefully lah ah cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again lah
huh this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was uh in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is err err specifically flying related
so uh they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day uh but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying lah
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
am I still what
in that in that in in in that ah oh debt uh I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them uh ah no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate uh site I was actually doing uh business business aircraft when I was in the
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
yes so when COVID happened err this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad err I mean it was just a very bad timing ah it was the worst hit industry ever uh unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and uh they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old lah so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again ah
to the parts ah they get uh they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
uh some of them they do but most of them for the most part err they don't need right they just they juts leave them there lah they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there ah nobody wants to uh you know ah then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this lah you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be lah
oh man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of uh of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot lah this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was uh it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay lah so I thought it was uh it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did lah and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
but but for now uh I got the next best thing which is uh flying drones lah
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers eh
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen ah but if that ever happens ah you will know why ah you know all about the history behind it lah you can tell people oh yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya lah yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know oh my goodness
yes

ah
ya ya eh tell me about your some of your your ya ya ya what are you doing now and stuff
okay
okay
okay
okay okay
mm
okay
why I scared to be bankrupt because I don't want to owe people money
ah but then a lot of things are restricted like you cannot uh apply for your own home you cannot invest
ah but if you're somebody with a home and if you are declared bankrupt then they will take away their home what no meh not true eh is it oh I didn't know I thought they will take why all your your earthly belongings and your possessions
oo
oo okay okay explain to me
uh huh
ya
ya ya that's what I thought
ya
okay
is it
oo
uh huh
uh huh
oo
if I don't pay my utility bills will they take away my house
oh shit oh my I still have my house lah it's just that I have no electricity okay okay
okay
right okay okay
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
three hundred dollars a month okay
right right okay okay
ya
okay
ya lah ya lah you will be in more debt right ya
oo okay okay okay okay okay
okay
uh huh
okay
so you can still but how are you going to have the money to travel when you are bankrupt
but but like they will take away your assets kan don't they take away some of your assets how does it work
uh huh
right
ya I've always had that impression
uh huh
right
okay
okay
yes
yes
correct
correct
correct correct
okay
mmhmm
okay
I don't buy under my name
uh huh
uh huh okay
oo but wouldn't they be able to trace
because just because it's not under my name lah so if it's so so the thing is that if if let's say all these things are under my name then they can pull it away they can take it away
ah I see
mm
ya ya ya ya
ah
mm
ah I see
oo I see but then what happens to the amount that I mean cannot recover the the the amount eh
but for how long though
five you cooling period means you
uh huh
ah
uh huh
right
okay
oo
oo okay uh huh
okay
oh wow
ah ah ah ah ah
oo I see
I see okay
oo
oo
ya I was always under the impression that I thought
ah
okay
government jobs lah ya ya ya
okay
oo oo oo yes yes yes yes
okay
oo
oo
ah I see okay okay okay
so so it's not that you cannot get a job it's just that the jobs that you uh ah able to get are limited lah certain industries ah
mm
ah I see
ya ya ya I see I see okay okay
the system lah ya lah that's true
ah
uh huh
ya
ya
so technically
damn
damn
oh my gosh
ya
mm
mm
correct correct correct
oh shit man ya I get oh wah like that lah I tell you your finances are going to be
I see I see
okay
two more minutes
ah
ah

okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
yes
cause
when
and like you know I have I've ever gone
not really ah
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
yea
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
huh
what
why
oh okay
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle what
besides
you know the
lanzhou beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes oof
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah oh my god
you know just now
tender
but
the what reason
pettiest
mm
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
oh my god is that your
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
they are like
how I say eh
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no lah I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
ya so like
uh actually
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
ah this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
right now in the world when there are doctors especially this kind of uh jobs doctors so if no they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah uh that should be my answer but if
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
that's what I feel lah because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on on the fence ah on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
mmhmm
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
but then
at forty two eh forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but uh
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at ah
mmhmm
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
mmhmm but the moral is don't give up ah
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said ah everything you explore
on after the next day
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at lah
mmhmm
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
wow okay
okay
that's the first wish eh
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this one it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
um
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
yes
yes
yes
mmhmm
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
the society's
yeah
mmhmm
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
oh yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like oh my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
mmhmm
I mean
that's good for you lah because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me ah I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook oh
why didn't you take culinary eh
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
oh okay
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
hmm
yeah
precisely what I what I I said lah it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
italian
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay ah what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
yeah
no no no no no no I'm not gonna say that
no it's not
yeah yeah I have another one
I already have my answer
it was
yeah yeah it was sweet it was cute like I
we wanted
we wanted to do something lah
oh eh
oh a'ah
but ya so
so like
I remember that
ee
is it gonna be Seoul Garden
oh my god Nandos
oh my god they're the worst
oh I think you told me before
ya ya ya
definitely lah
oh yeah you have that once a year kind of
yeah I know
it happened this year
yeah
yeah it happened
it's something lah I think you I didn't sleep on that day
I remember I didn't sleep in January because you wanted me to stay because you were sick
yeah
I have one stupid question
I saw one
would you rather fight
one horse-sized otter
or a hundred otter-sized horses
you would you rather fight one horse-sized otter
you know otters right
or one hundred otter-sized horses
I
I think
I think I will fight the one horse-sized otter
but holy shit
yeah but it's like there's too many of it hundred eh
ya at least one horse-sized otter you can just run away from that one thing and is very big you know where it is
right
yeah
then at least you know where to you know who to run away from
this
and horses eh imagine you close your eyes a hundred horses even though it's more
horses
ah come on you know what I'm gonna choose
doctor stranger
duh
freaking cool
because scarlet witch is too strong for him
but this doctor strange I can go into places I can look at places I can look in the future I can look in the past I can go back and do this
there's so many things I can do
ya but I know what to do
if you I know when you gonna die
ya so like like that that that scene lah he went through with how many only fourteen million plus
timeline and there's only one that worked and he knew what to do
to make sure that one work
get it so that's what I'm going to do
so I'm going to like go into time
and like choose the best
timeline
then I'm like ah this one will do
get it yes
and and he's intelligent also so
oh my god I can't wait for the new one to come out I want to watch
I wanna watch
ya oh my god
I can't wait
it's
hmm
what do you deserve
oh okay
so metaphorically
metaphorically
oh so now you hate the the oh shit
and then
it
you get ignorance
hmm
I don't know what I'm gonna get
why
why
think I will get
a food that is intimidating
what you mean there's
to you lah because I I talk to you as a as a partner I don't talk to you as a
that's not what I get from everyone
that's not what I what I get from everyone else when I step into the room ya you you ask all my juniors
I have when I'm in work mode
they are scared
you know I'm just saying like I have that
work switch you know
so that that work switch and that
that
that aura that I bring when I'm serious it's very intimidating and
feels
for people is not approachable
that's what I got from people
it's not something that I think I am myself
but that's what people have been telling me
and I feel that has to change
if you want to teach someone you wanna help someone you can't be intimidating
yeah

jet planes on a hospital up till today I cannot
swallow that
idea at all its so
hmm
um

I think they did give a bonus

they deserve more than just a bonus
yeah
right now
the COVID thing makes them work extra hard is unfair for them
what would be the worst
buy one get one free sale ever
why that's good what you get two what you can eat more what
ah my mum would like that

it's it's a mother thing what no eh
I know you won't even eat anything in the kitchen
unless unless it's fried chicken
yeah
after cooking I'm talking about like like raw ingredient
I eat fishcake
well
you know
I
but that one
repercussion
yeah I like it
duh of course it's not
it's not
that
yeah
ya lah
I haven't had any
for
the last time I had was that one I had when I went to bugis plus with you
yeah exactly
that's like
that's like way before I had dengue seh
like a month at least
a month plus
no
I don't need bubble tea
I rather Boost
like
yeah yeah
and I when I was gym-ing ah
and I gain a lot of muscle mass
ya and and my dinner is like
why
mm
okay it's one hour already yes we did it
yay okay bye bye
bye

eh hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
mm
ya
ya
the same
have you checked
oh okay
ten gigabyte kan per month okay
oh
ya ya
uh
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years eh but I think you just bought kan iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade eh
oh still iphone lah
oh but I think recently you bought kan a new phone
oh
ya
unless you have wifi lah at home you already have wifi kan or
ya
ya
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
there's about four point seven inch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition ah I don't think so
let me check
there's no more ah sorry they don't sell anymore ah iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven lah so I think for camera wise if you love the camera kan take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough ah iphone eleven uh
not too sure ah cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven ah
ya alamak
who
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off ah
I'm not really looking to job search yet ah cause I'm doing freelance ah so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year lah I try to finish this projects and without expecting much lah I think I think the most important thing is experience ah and the skills that I will acquire ya
once I start working ah I'm more prepared ah prepared than ever
I think it's a bit hard ah because once you already
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test ah they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills ah you have the knowledge
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
ah ya
and they will ask you like on the spot lah like how do you solve this ah ah this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem lah I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is uh that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them lah
ya
it's more mostly interview skills lah that
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
ah monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast ah mm
the expected
oh
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you lah
oh
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
oh okay okay
ya
ya
ya
oh
ya
ya
mmhmm
oh
oh okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
ah the
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm
mmhmm
microsoft office ah
okay okay
oh ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed ah
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is uh I think
oh
mm
ya over work ah
ya
ya
yup understood
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding kan they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable lah you can still read the code ah like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
oh okay okay eh never heard before eh
even though I am a computer science
C hash eh
I think it's called C sharp ah
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before lah during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know lah this kind of
mostly low level lah like C sharp python eh sorry C sharp uh what is it called ah ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable ah than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing ah more structured
ya
mm
how do you spell logs
oh log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error eh
ya
mm
ya ya
ya
ya
ya

mm
ya it's similar ah same as when you go to grocery
ya
then you are like it's like shopping ah
ah it's a virtual ah everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real ah I mean impossible ah but its similar lah it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
it's the same as you are shopping ah it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually lah
ya very interesting
ya I think like imagine like walking ah
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab kan
why
access to shopping mall eh is it
mmhmm
oh ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally ah I'm not too sure ah there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before ah I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
mm
ya
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
ya
the manager will ask ah like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint ah sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya
ah you also need to be involved in like zoom zoom meeting
for presentation
ya of course ah I think they are going to make one in singapore kan
ya
ah but I not too sure ah like I heard from the news ya and they were hiring ah mm I think a lot foreigner ah
oh ikea ah I don't I don't think so actually I don't buy like
so maybe I might go with him lah I'm not sure when maybe next week
which one the restaurant ah
of course ah open lah
but they limit ah they limit like
ya they make
one one table kan like ya seat of four or seat of two
ya couple family kan
ya
ya
oh counter table ya
oh
mm
ya yup understand
not too sure ah
oh
shopping mall eh is it like shopping mall
oh okay
ya ya
open concept ah
it's like open concept ah
mm
ya
oh ya ya
mm
mm
ya
mm truth
mm
ya
ya
restaurant or bar kan they they have a lot of
ya
ya lah
of course ah
ya
mmhmm
ambassador
ya
ah true ah
I think just make sure like everyone just follow ah cause now nowadays people like
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible lah just that location wise is a bit some ah some ya ya true ah some some ah some might be insecure a bit ah like
to be in track kan
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
ya definitely ah bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running ah it will still run ya because it need to keep checking kan
I'm not too sure ah I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise ah so I think they need like support of
I think so ah I think it's just the bluetooth ah like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device kan
ya this is not this is not easy ah because because I think they still updates ah they're still updating they are still improving
for apple kan and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone kan
Google
oh
android
mm
oh google home ya
ya
ya
who
google home okay
ya
mmhmm
yup correct
ya
ah ya ya
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
I think so ah
the microphone is how far
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ah there's something
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
like
ya amazon products
ya
oh
mmhmm
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
I think not too sure ah like they have their own ya they have their own brand ah I'm not not sure what brand is that ah
maybe maybe they collaborate hmm
I think there might be lah not too sure like
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house ah like or what like
ya
ya because
they use leg
ah pedal pedal ya so they have to use
uh our hand lah our hand to press the button
ya
paya lebar ya I saw I went to paya lebar
oh
ya ya
mm
oh ya ya ya

K
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one lah
so I think you can start first ah
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
ah kinaesthetic
ah kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility ah
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective lah
batman
can help others
but like for me is basically
oh so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
mm ah
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
harry potter there's this
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot lah what's the the magic spell
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing err port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish err irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
robert pattinson
ya that one
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers ah wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
ah if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
K but maybe
ah specifically to children ah because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard ah
like
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
I think also works for ah
adults ah
um but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
ya lah but
teleportation ah
but it saves time it's very quick
mm
ya ah but the thing is
you are saving time
teleportation
please lah don't cut me off lah the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this lah but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it lah ah
ya okay
so that's teleportation
err
um if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
ya
but money to me do it is not everything ah
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
ah your energy your smile and your
sorry occupational hazard K ah teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son aydin
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
wah you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
mm
mm
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited ah okay
orh
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective eh
work hard themselves
okay
mm
okay
err but I okay lah maybe for you kan
K
but I oh something came across my mind lah
ya I know it's just
a superpower
ya
mm
showing
the other side of ya
mm
okay
that's you were saying superpower
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
mm
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome lah
yes no the thing because I was thinking
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
ah
ah the bull's eye of medicine ah ah
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
but also
subsidised
subsidised
then that one you have to talk to the experts ah
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
ah not everyone
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
okay so
eh so that's about superpower lah
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
ah
or because I can
that is just lah
mm wonder woman eh
is okay wonder
okay can I I I will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
ya
ya lah
so but she can do oh she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
about wonder
orh
okay
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
oh it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
eh then that's boring man
eh but they are supposed to
people view online lah
ya there's ah people be ya video on demand
people view
no not apple lah then only apple people
only iMac
mm something like Netflix ah
extra lah then technology is already so fast pace
but is it
Netflix
ya lah
okay actually kan I'm not too sure how much
no
actually like
movie korean you're alive in zombie though
movie korean ya alive and zombie though
like
wah
how
as in like they don't
oh I know okay
maybe
mm
mm
aiya
mm
okay
like ridiculous ah
mm
ya lah but
ah
because of time
mm
but you must understand my my feel
okay the thing is I told you already kan
runs very fast
no the thing is the details
if I want to know
I will read about it
ya or I will go back
like you know I have a lot of things to do
like
ya lah
and
uh
so that is my stand on why I'd like to fast forward
superpower okay
oh now what's what superhero is it
what superhero
burdensome
no we were we were talking about wonder woman batman
mm
mm batman eh
mm
batman eh
ya lah
ah the thing is I I've not

ya err
no thanks to david moyes we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back um bit our hand back
and you associated with all of them
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya ah the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about thiago he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in barcelona central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
I can't believe sia
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham a'ah
when did they ever not lost okay ah to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean ah but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
arteta
plus minus ah plus minus ah
he knows his a level above everybody else ah no but but K you know there's this two theories of
err two types of players football theory eh two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers kan
ah the likes of
guardiola
and pochettino and martinez and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis van gaal ah ajax school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis van gaal is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but err no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective ah okay err
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent ah
he does basically ah
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen ah in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis van gaal school of control
wait then then I have the flip side ah the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually merino takes everything that is strong about louis van gaal and finds the witnesses so like louis van gaal takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using merino flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing ah
bionic inter milan game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but inter milan won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is err
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's mourinho
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin ah
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick zambia lonso
err err schools that kind of control zavi iniesta chaos player
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so err he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why van gaal and cryuff although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
cryuff emphasise more on individual creativity van gaal is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what mourinho exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre ah mourinho he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
opposites outside of the spectrum for one klopp
he
klopp denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
ya ya ya swan
mm
but on Android I I don't have a four

okay
alright so on on the surface level eh on the surface level is like ah
desensitising us to sexualisation so
ten eleven years old kan
eleven years old not wearing ah so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids ah and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences eh
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing lah that's the justification ah so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world ah mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people
it's not a sleazy casting call ah
mm mm
kevin spacey serious

pressurising you to look good in this way use this shade of colour that shade of colour and you are happily buying makeup and you're saying that you are in control of yourself and
are not independent thinkers that they are subconsciously being steered in this direction by the media by by societal pressure by the expectation to look something in a certain way

Netflix binging I've I've cleared so many shows just by watching
four five episodes a night on a weekday and I just basically every weeknight I clear four or five episodes so I started off with
when we started listing
use of my time ya ya unfortunately ya
you watch again superb show lah then
correct
yes
what
better call saul correct
I think season two you still have not ah coming to six
he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself ah ah to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am kan uh we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
morally ambiguous ah but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging tau when you put yourself in and ask yourself
ah ah ah ah ah it's a psychological phenomenon ah it's not a physical disability actually
ya in a fire self-immolation
okay a'ah a'ah
sheer willpower ah a'ah
mm ya
a'ah a'ah but
you should lah sial dude
have you watch prison break
a whole season or all four all four seasons
followed by the movie
no
what is his name will
he didn't die ya he declared himself gay but he
okay
what why why should that be to you you should be to woman okay but err there's four seasons of prison break followed by a movie
after you watch okay after you watch after you watch the movie then you follow season five
there's a season five and that's the final season
ah so it's a four seasons
movie then season five err
that one on the way their their in the works
okay season fourteen end up somewhere around two thousand twelve or thousand thirteen
ah then the movie then two thousand seventeen they came out with with
season five
a'ah
which is and is is coming soon
I started on watching this thing called peaky blinders
peaky blinders is short ah it's only four seasons of six episodes each very short
what iPhone is that doesn't look different from previous iPhone
okay
okay
safe entry
camera ah
I scan one
I keep the browser open
mmhmm
mmhmm
really
okay
mmhmm
which is which yours
why double tap when you can just press the camera app
cause it's you double tap then you still have to press the thing right
ya
oh you go it goes in a clockwise
ah
mm
uh huh
uh huh
so where is
oo
ya ya ya ya ya ya
as long as
a'ah
what's vending machine cafe
I think so
why
one corner
wait
oh hawker centre
a'ah a'ah correct
mmhmm
so it's not the
a'ah ya lah ya lah ya lah

right
can
oh okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
your wedding date will be available then um you can
choose
eh I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically err when you
what's that called where he lives is also err stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just um
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance lah ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
oh then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is ah amendment there is ah basically um when you choose err your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things ah
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to lina everything kan send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire um all the details so that err being a typical singaporean ah we kiasu one so err once err once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
ya is it ten is it oh okay
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller lah basically
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay ah
that's one thing also but
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that lah but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
cause okay
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like err like they're they're very busy lah so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
so included me and alina
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different lah
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday ah you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you oh close the window
ya things like that lah but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
um
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot lah ya but for me it was I chose the eh no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
um ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different ah mm different ah
wah I don't remember whether there's any charges eh
okay okay
don't need one not necessary ah they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
like what is um it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
ya so I told them err I I've got work lah they will they will still will pressure you then oh but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
ya so then you have
you can ask the mother
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
but that word everybody thinks that oh it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end what ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch oh now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point kan
mm dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say err like
it it defeat to me lah it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it lah like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends lah ya so
all weddings there will be time time time delay
really
ceremony there will start at one thirty
then she's like I think we should move off now
kan then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing lah cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding eh eleven thirty she said we should move off now
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location what how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully lah it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live err a chendol station ah everything like in the mosque everything lah quite quite nice lah he paid for everything
then ya lor then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is um itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
for me lah is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible lah in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
yes transportation is is the problem to me ah that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
how no no no no yes they their eh they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way lah you know that they want to save your money and
different person different lor ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing ah they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
err I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at bedok reservoir
ya
ya
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to dewi
like for me I leave it to alina like for me I leave it to alina on how you want to to but the thing is like alina also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research mah
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like eh I cannot be splitting it right down the middle ah right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like eh our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like eh I want fifty dollar my problem lah
I pay myself what that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have err chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that lah ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
mm salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
um
mm
mm
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding err expo and everything kan so it's a bit different ah
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography ah ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing lah ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
mmhmm can do that also
err I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place lah if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled lah I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
mm can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us lah
ya it is quite nice also over there um on the wedding day itself lah ya
as in your wedding day lah I want to book the indigo room over there oh no need lah ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points oh no need lah no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel mm no need no need no need
um
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well lah I would say err okay so basically
you have to see
mm yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and alina did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
wah she the that that that girl is amazing ah ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
but
ya it's all it's all my cousins lor all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early kan ya
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues lah basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about err the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important lah
we didn't walk in
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
ya
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
I was like
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
things like that lah
okay
mmhmm I would say you don't need to worry about the activity ah people will just take picture with you lah
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing eh no one no one cares lah
my the recent one with my with my err sister in law's brother we did at err malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
ya no problem lah
no need lah okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know oh but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
no but the two weddings I been to also
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's wah you got a lot money
to me lah personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me lah personally
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements what
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
yes
yup we we make our own lah um cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early lah cause it's it's not fast job mah
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like wow
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
err my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
mm but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know one when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very kiasu game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like alina throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be what then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes ah and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks lah the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important lor
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right um
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff lah I would say but I like him because err he listens to what I say
ah then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional lah he listens to me lah ya
yup ya so I just walk around ah I told him to follow me ya no lah I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked lina to go inside then she like
I don't know wedding then she okay no need ah ya

ah I'm good I'm good
okay everything is normal but then
err yes err
like one of them err
is now doing the parking the parking
and then err anas is
doing err more of for farming
eh ya ten dollars lah
just to err
err so corn is a one year harvest program lah something like that
ah so if one year harvest corn then one year later
how's the the the the the situation there
oh okay okay okay ya see I see I see then when when you come back from err batam I I know you went batam but I when did you went to batam
you went there for your business
I see
ah okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve err november
orh then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks lah ah
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain lah facebook lah they say not nice lah some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from batam or is there any requirement that you need to get
okay
ah
ah
ah okay okay okay so you you
batam from batam you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront
but I'm not sure
mm
okay
very
ah it's just probably he never come back to singapore for seventeen years lah probably
ah maybe
ya lah too much lah this one ah anyway ah so your two weeks how okay everything
ah
ah
orh
ah
uh huh
okay lah
ah okay
ah so now after that you doing deliveroo ah okay lah deliveroo so usually what time you start for weekend for your deliveroo I mean as in food delivery
ah
okay
mm
oh
okay
ya true true true
you manage your own time you manage your own money everything is you on your own lah okay lah
ya true
talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks dah end of the year already wah very fast man correct or not ah
alamak
ah
this is a new beginning ah they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know lah ah I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
sixteen march eh
but but very fast ah nine months
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one ah that's what they said is probably two two lah so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
mm
okay lah spend money in singapore lah staycation now government give ah hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel lah I think you have to book to those but five platform only
the places that you want to go err places of interest or staycation
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass ah and then from there then you can use lah you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
okay lah they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore lah but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one lah so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period ah
eh
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo jurong bird park sentosa I don't want lah so all these places went already ah so I need to go something different ah maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night ah maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels lah you want to go those like hotel ah of course you need to come out still same price lah not much difference ah anyway
ya
ah
serious ah
government give us ah
mm
ah
ah okay okay I understand
ah so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing lah
huh
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah lah example ah one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
be quite too expensive or what
no
huh
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
huh I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then uh hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up what then what's the point of
huh
bullshit
huh
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive what right so why is the other way round
what the
really happen
until now ah
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
oh that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better what
funny ah
why ah like that
anyway
ya
ah ah
ah and then go and then he video call and then he wave at the wife using binoculars oh my god so cute
very the romantic lucky never go viral maybe ah maybe whoever pick up that story ah and then share share share share ah
I do not know ah shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is johor one is woodlands so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet ah whoever pick up that story ah go viral ah
no lah he I think yes he no eh
this year ya correct correct because right right right
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual err wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel kan for him
ask his wife to come singapore ah bring in
he is going back to johor
so he's
then after that he's
oh he is going back johor now
then
no pay leave two months lah singapore no pay leave two months ah
ah then after that bring in the wife come singapore
huh
oh ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia johor you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation lah
but singapore
the the the cases zero what community wise why go there still still need to
subsidise lah
I mean if if if now err the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go johor knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now
funny lah they all anyway
it's okay lah at least happy for him lah at least you know see his wife
mm
investment lah it's good investment lah
ah
ah
ah
the two weeks
that one two weeks two weeks you stay worse
you never join the apps ah they got apps like zumba lah exercise lah yoga
ah then
I also do other things also at the same time I also helping my my
friend doing this err food
so now we are
for what
okay
ah
ah okay lah
ah
ah I see okay lah
ah so call like a whole set lah
ah
okay okay okay
so he did that also lah
but now because of this COVID thing lah
so for me nowadays you you see my new family cusina
oh ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing ah because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation eh whereby if let's say you go to
thai vietnamese
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
ah is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and err gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place lah be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put err err err
different taste local of a filipino taste lah so yes we did that already so alhamdulillah there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
home made ah
hopefully lah
a'ah
ah
correct
ah
ah
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully lah ah be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet lah because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first uh uh
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it err
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert lah then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
okay lah good lah I was thinking
correct
true
ya lah
so ya lah so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully lah hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit lah
so I I I I will add you don't worry I will add your I know who is this toklang right should I accept should I not this is a scam later somebody I also do not know then after that add already ah this one ah could you give me money this one transfer here oi so many nowadays so that why I worried since you say that is your account I will accept and I will add you
ah that's why I was thinking alfi already got the account what so this one is this one is err new account the other account get hack or what I also do not know but
I will accept that don't worry then I will add you to a dot J underscore kusina or kitchen kusina kitchen
ya
from the house itself lah so probably now also weekend right so nobody wakes up early what
right
then the order
okay lah but then
from ten to maybe two lah today
then
aduh
uh I thought somebody want to come out summon what
ya lah can one
then after this you straightaway go
do do grab already ah I mean do do deliveroo already ah
ah
ah
ya true true
and ah for me today oh today I think I go back later I still need to I just another order coming today banana bread with chocolate melts
that means the banana bread you cut that banana bread inside there is chocolate melts
whoever order this one because no I I do I mean friends or whoever wants to order from me right I mean there are
food I mean standard lah default default like I do this okay that means for example banana cake or I do strawberry cheesecake cups with blueberry cheesecake cups
so these are the standard item standard food but if let's say you want to have something extra inside like example banana cake is just banana cake so someone ordered
ashraf can I ordered banana cake with chocolate melts inside
can
the other guy wants the chicken which is
super spicy different from these three they want something like spicy spiciness how lah this spicy okay lah can lah I can do for you so it's
can be done lah not say cannot be done it can be done like muffin also we do the same what we have blueberry
we have err blueberry muffin banana walnut muffin
uh chocolates muffins so even to have something different can lah we customised to
your tastes lah ah ah so ya we do that lah alhamdulillah lah so today
there's order later five so still have time to go back
and then do cooking ya so we we try to do during I mean
uh we we can't take too much order yet because of
both of us working and then err you know so we
try to take those like during the weekend in advance lah so at least we we can prepare in advance the food the ingredient ya plan plan out what are the things that we need to prepare lah
uh so
I think they came down from from slope correct because err I think behind us is all those private houses right I think there's those err
trail lah so I think there is ya ya ya there is a trail out there so
ah
eh
don't reject too much people know later bukit timah why bukit timah ah so many rejection oh something after night ah something spooky so I don't not want to go up it's it's not spooky lah it's just that the feeling ah there's a feeling like
so dark what all those expats ah

ah
I don't know a lot of histories out there lah so a lot of people like rider like all those I see bicycle know going up to do cycling saturday sunday a lot cycling places ah but very quiet lah

okay
err
thank you so much okay so um
uh are you studying now are you working tell us more
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great ah okay
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
okay
it's it's not a definite shape I can say ah it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or ah specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
unique
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
a few types of mango
and yeah
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite my favourite fruit
so ya moving on err
nah when like I don't know supermarket
err
err hangs around the station
like late at night
so
okay thank you so much
uh ya exactly like I mean uh
in singapore it's it's a very common fruit to find
um
and as products they they come in varieties a variety of products
what do you think
mmhmm mmhmm
err
beauty products so
okay in other forms of food
like like my sister said it's err
for me it does makes me feel happy
err
mango tea kan
dessert
exactly cause
it's
yellow
and
it just draws
err mango bingsu
err
perfect
sunshine eh
um
it's like a brand
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a uh err a fruit name for a brand because
uh they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all lah because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
I guess
that's interesting
okay
I feel like
mango cake is something that you would find easily
hmm
exactly
exactly I feel that
sure I mean uh that whatever that she said was right because I feel that
we don't really think about
oh my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs ah we there's also
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
pudding kan
like
it's amazing how how much I love mango pudding
process
that's true
about having mango soda
do you have have you had any mango sodas
okay
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking kan um
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about um
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
okay
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
it's way before all of us
and there are a hundred types of mango
each with a unique taste shape
so
okay this fruit is not only delicious but boasts
it's actually quite true cause
that
okay the fact that it has it's sweet
eating snacks that is high in sugar you know like
it's
I don't know it's
it could be replaced with just eating mango which is amazing
mango and its nutrients to health benefits
uh it's a good news right because we love eating mango so much
that uh
we know that it has its health benefits
like ya uh such as improved immunity okay that's one of the benefits
wow that's really interesting
protein about
uh vitamin C sixty seven percent of
the reference daily intake
vitamin B six eleven point six percent of the
okay err vitamin A ten per cent of the vitamin E nine percent nine point seven percent of the
vitamin B five six point five percent of the
um honestly
I don't even know what all this means but I'm just reading it out as part of the conversation lah kan
err everyday we learn new things from this conversation
vitamin K okay err six percent of the I I don't know if I've already said that
niacin
five percent of the manganese four point five percent of the
calcium selenium and iron
wow interesting
okay
okay

okay what uh which artist do you listen to the most
okay but
um I wouldn't say okay my favourite song
it
that's just what you feel about it
err I rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that I'm talking about it now
okay so uh besides that err canon in D eh that's one genre that I don't listen all the time but that that's a song that I really really like above all the other songs that I hear
and okay
k-pop
they both have very distinct uh features they both have
ah I will never let you down by rita ora I think that song is very empowering
besides that okay I I also listen to spanish songs and
the the background music has this um hum
accordion and I don't know it's just it's just very

feel and what not

the fact that she can
because I I feel like the good show eh the sorry the good place is a show that is not easy to act in because
it's it involves okay ah

okay
so
hi
uh this is madir and this is my speaking partner zaini
um zaini say something
hi okay so let's look at the prompts um
ah
how are you today
okay
okay so let's
ah
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay lah that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
uh the
oh the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but uh it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow lah but
I suppose um ya
ya
okay
but
still at the back of my mind um
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect um you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult lah and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
uh
ha okay
ya
uh huh
uh huh
huh okay
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house ah
huh
ya ya what do think of the house ah
mmhmm
keep talking ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean for me ya lah I mean it's I do feel
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to kan like I mean like I've always been living in yishun
and then now moving to tampines so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me lah ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
mm
ya
ya lah
ya
uh okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions lah it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
uh huh
uh first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know uh really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand lah
and then the second
would be obviously
oh but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
hmm
mm
like would be health
um you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
uh and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
um
you know what I think I want to talk about our house
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
not no what I'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small I mean it is
I would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no I just wanted to
the only lah but the buttons ge ge which is good lah
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
I was kinda glad that the
me
I choose it
I wanted the the
are you sure
hmm
iran
yang paling digemari
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like mm ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
ya ya ya ya ya that one was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
um we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
mm where they were that was really really very nice and then um
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went tehran
we didn't have a guide like what we had uh in isfahan and yazd
eh no no no we didn't have yazd it's shiraz sorry ya
but
ya lah we didn't have a guide lah
would have been nice lah if we had a guide ah but we didn't have a guide
ya
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
huh
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to bordeaux so many times
oh ya
mm
cranny
mmhmm
uh biarritz
no yes we did we went to biarritz we went to cannes
yes
then from bordeaux we went ya we went to uh dune du pilat
and then we went to biarritz
ya and then we went to arcachon ya
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
uh huh
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course lah it has to be attractive in my way lah
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
hmm and you know the person's kind of vibe ah not not not personality or character lah because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well ah
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
I'm about to really go deep
yes ya
yes
eh no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
soalan pertama fahamkan anda
no
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
mmhmm okay
why
uh huh
ah okay
uh huh
uh
um
design
uh
um
accounting
accounting
accounting ya
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
uh would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question um
okay
uh
uh
uh talented
I have no idea what talented means uh is in in in malay um
uh
ya tom holland
mmhmm
ah
uh huh
actually
uh huh
okay um
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right um how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
um
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could um not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample um opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
um
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
um
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know uh make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree uh unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
and
ya
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
okay cleaning done wah
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
yes
ya
ah oh
we can go later we can go tomorrow
yup
okay so okay
ya
I kinda like it though
it kinda looks more like uh rustic to me
okay
actually kan
I was imagining the the counter top to be
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
eh thicker
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly ah
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
um
uh
I can eat that I think for every single meal
you know
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
ya
ya but back to our house I actually cannot believe that you know that this is going to be our place
just
you know the wall
actually I was thinking ah like dining area
or just this wall
just this wall
the store wall
okay lah
okay lah just leave it plain lah then I can put paintings
no lah I honestly I I don't like lah I mean like
not not the wall lah
eh
eh
what the hell
okay
wallpaper-wallpaper design
nope
no no no
maybe just
sure
no not this one
no
ah
ah
no no don't want don't want
what
no no no I don't like the pattern

ya ya ya
actually this is buying
grandeur twenty eighteen
serene
ya
which I don't think so
I sincerely don't think so lah seriously don't think that it's gonna be
just take a look
ya ya ya we wanna change ya we wanna change in february
february is soon by the way
ah
wah

okay
okay ya
we're good
ah eh eh
eh bro school is eh I hate school
school can go suck dick I'm telling you
okay eh I got one website for
for this one module okay I've five modules lah
so I have my student portal that's one website
okay ah then I got one website for my
uh module submission for another module
I have one website for this other module submission
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites kan is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like you know you know
amongst the students lah
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like eh this one how this one how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that lah to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like um there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
I have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then I have to ya then I have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so I ask around some random stupid questions ah
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota lah
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat lah having a lecture or having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
ask even the professor lah
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use Zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively what
seriously it's so ineffective then I'm
I I like stay up until like two A M almost everyday sia just to do work
mmhmm ya
ya
but
not not on the first week lah like almost all lectures I have
this one lecture I have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example ah python err you there's this one
ah ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input ah input format lah
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
it's it's just so bad ah like and then
I don't know like even the other day
err I have this other module okay
ah it's basically I'm learning about digital electronics lah
I I got some friends lah I got some friends here and there
then the other day I I taught two of them I only took
two hours to teach them I think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
ah like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad lah because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things eh
ya and
ya and honestly I didn't expect that it would be that way
because I thought that
when people say Singapore university of self study eh
okay like that's what people say lah my friend also say that he's in
and then after that I'm like okay lah maybe is terrible lah
but then when I come to I expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
I don't know ah to me it's it's it's just nonsense ah
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like I think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two
err asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
in uni I have to constantly stay up until two just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up ah just to do it
then it's just like it's just so I don't know
this is just too crazy lah honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent lah
this type of high
um really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother one ah
they really not brother one but but right at least it's they quite brother lah because
err and I found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two I have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty lah
ya lah ya lah irfan</P1 your age lah but what I'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya I've never met anyone below twenty eh
ya I eh
ya ya uh everyone there is from like or from poly
wait eh hang on eh
ya ah
ah okay
but
oh part time uni
err um
oh honestly the
I don't think even is a
I don't know is a good choice or not I got I got two friends in
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work lah
there's things to do here and there
ya I think is mainly for people from like from poly the more rilek ones lah the one the not so snake one
ya
but I but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
which is ten percent of my grades
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test lah eh no it's a
test from home
but I'm this browser that you know how you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so so my they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down eh where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they ah
they force they shut things down like
your Telegram
like Discord Steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya lah
stewing from that lah
ya is it is a browser lah on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
I think I no I'm I need to have I need to have internet connection to have the test lah
but I cannot access anything else
ya but I need internet connection because it's a test what
so they ah and then after that the test got webcam ah
I need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam ah either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam what
ya ya ya um the one of the professors actually do that
using her phone for a webcam for like writing things down because maths
and maths how can you teach maths without actually writing things down right
ya
by the way
you have a report ya ah
cause
ya then yesterday I spent like the
I think I spent like two hours writing on just like a few paragraphs of my report because I've never actually I have done a report in poly
but report in poly and report in uni is you know the standards are different
err like you actually have to put in some effort
for a report in uni
I mean
but
would uni I actually have to write I had like ten tabs open just
for
um just for this report section
ya lah I'm but as in what I'm saying is thatthe the step from poly to uni is very drastic you know
I got one friend who is taking this module as me
then you know he's just panicking ah
mm trimester
ah so but then for the first year
ah
okay so it's very weird
when the other day when I was comparing I was talking I was telling I was talking about this with my friends the other day it was super weird
so you know how in or even in you had
thirteen weeks in one semester
right
and then after that my trimester you'd would expect because I have three trimesters in one year right you would expect it to be like okay lah maybe
lesser lesser weeks right lesser weeks because because trimester you have three terms as compared to two terms
right
so you would expect like okay ah trimester but then eh my trimester
thirteen weeks also eh then I see eh their semester
what did I sign up for my my I got three terms each term is thirteen weeks
got two terms each term is thirteen weeks also like what
ya my break time is small lah
but it doesn't it doesn't defeat the fact that
my one term is the same as other university's one term eventhough I'm trimester based you know
ya
no lah err ya lah ya lah
serious I didn't I didn't expect it to be
I didn't expect it to I have to put in so much effort you know
like mm
ya like my sisters were like wah koi koi run
utterly hardworking eh and I'm like no lah I just unfortunately I have to be a hardworking lah
I also don't want to be hardworking but
you know unfortunately I have to be
it's just unfortunately I have to be
eh but you're applying for uni you you're applying for uni or are you going to apply for uni
what was your
mmhmm
I think I think march close I think march close
so you did online interview
why how did you screw up
okay
everyone's volume is err everyone's work is high volume lah basically
ah
okay
okay
for all the courses eh
mmhmm mmhmm
okay
um information security
mmhmm ya with honours
wait how can you apply for only two courses they asked for like six seven courses what
huh seriously
uh huh I think it was six leh
uh huh
you thought portfolio was
the heck okay
ah okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
interest
ya like a reference lah
oh okay
oh okay
ya
what was the what was the second course
what was
ya
no that was no the one that with the portfolio what was it
mm oh okay okay
not bad lah ah sia lah if only hmm if only you were
ya I know right then you'll be stressing out like me also
uh huh ya
mmhmm
ah
oh
I I applied for on err twenty seventeen eh no twenty eighteen or twenty nineteen
eh
ya but then the thing is um
I applied too late like I applied in march also
so I was too late for the for everything so uh there was no slots for me lah
then on the twenty nineteen I applied again and then they asked for a video interview
and then after that the video interview then got the
mass interview like a group interview
ya ya ya but the video interview I got tell you or not the story before
ah
they were like okay so the video they were giving me instructions lah it was like oh video interview is prerecorded
so that means it's not live
questions
then they send it over to me
then
ya ya
yes yes ya that type of thing ah
ya so the other day right um I I had that lah
and then after that one of the questions I can remember I two of the questions I cannot remember one of the questions was like
err out of all the modules
out of the out of all the modules in the module list right
what modules do you like the most and I'm like oh shit
while during the interview while during the thirty seconds break in between questions right
I realised that there's this this this lah and have done
this this this in the past and also uh I have some experience with it okay next question
err what modules do you like the least then after that I I reply in this exact same way
looking through the module list err I realised that there's maths lah
I I'm I'm okay with maths I'm I I did well for maths
but I don't like maths lah that's how I replied you know in the interview
and I managed to get through the through the video interview and into the group interview lah
ya so the group interview it was like stage two right
so the group interview um it was err
the group interview was like I thought it was like one group by one group
okay then after that they brought us out to this err to this like before this room after registering
then after that I'm like ah then I was talking with my group my lah then I was like eh
if it's a group interview how come we're all over here sia going inside this one room is it a mass interview
don't know ah maybe ah
then they're like okay so this is the
this this is the like the contents okay this is the problem
I want you all to you you all got thirty minutes I want you all to work on this
and by the end of the thirty minutes you are to present a
maximum hundred eighty second video presentation using your phone
okay if there's nothing else that's all you just can go home huh
ya and then like ah okay that's all I was like ah okay I expected something a bit more difficult lah
then after that like ya we'll then you can go then we'll send you the uh the email
saying whether you have passed or not lah like next week
okay so I I expected seven days from now lah
mm okay then on the seventh day from the interview I was like eh shit I never received any email sia
ah ah okay because right
is they want to build it such that
you are working in a team
right so
that's why the group interview
is is mass as a group interview but then they want to see how well you work in a team
how your how well you work in a team
how you would communicate with people how you work with people from different backgrounds
with people that you don't know
so is mainly built on top of that
of how you
it's a very team effort lah
so I I guess they evaluate as to how we
were acting in a team okay then after that how well we do our things our
video interview eh our video presentation how was it
all all that thing lah
ya that's that's how I did it lah I don't know maybe because
but then last year
there wasn't be any COVID yet right
ya so I don't know maybe maybe because you applied too late lah honestly
no no no
okay
mm
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
mm ya ya
mmhmm
oh so you are saying that like
so is that what you're trying to say
oh okay lah
mmhmm
ah okay
okay
mm but what type of jobs are you applying for that's the question
okay
mm ya
no but all these all these honestly right all these like
they ask for like two three years of experience right
okay
uh huh
uh err ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
mmhmm
oh like prorated kind of thing ah
ya ya ya okay
so
ah
ah
wei eh ah the other day I just bought this ah

uh huh
seriously
uh huh

mmhmm
eh eh
oi don't like that lah
ya loh then I don't know I just then uh the other day my I met up with my my officer from my unit
ya lah then because he also I have to meet him soon because
to me it's unheard of ah okay when you an okay then after that when you want to
eh ultraboost is for casual this one is for running
eventhough I have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that I have no time seriously you know I I doing work
right you know I the other day I spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay I had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is I take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation lah so I had this ah
I had this lake concept method the other time
and err I will I couldn't get it to work lah even though the concept was there
the idea was there but I couldn't get it to work so I asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept I two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but I cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax lah
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right I put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
sia lah
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course lah comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
two thirty
no lah my friends they don't mind me leaving the house
but
that type of thing you know
a'ah sia
I tell you it's like oh goodness
wow I'm a changed man changes people they say changes people they say

it's quite filling
okay
okay unless we just keep it to five lor like
ya
ya
reunion school reunion
when
ah what was that one day
ya the
fortune cookie

vegan
okay can
wait when when is the dinner
oh
oh oh ya
mm
okay lor
then like that
we can dinner on twenty eight or twenty nine
at buffet town
hopefully
could be
okay
eh but you said at west
oh
we going two days one night ah
oh
wait twenty eight is err
monday sunday sunday lah I think it's sunday lah sunday monday cause every setup he got one weekend he needs to clear
ya
no I think it's sunday monday
eh maybe monday tuesday
oh rates
then he say it's like seven hundred online
the I was only four hundred
but how come it's just that date difference ah
oh
lame
speaking of travel
of course lah I mean it's so nice the weather is cold
no
okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer hais that was
global warming
too bad
okay lah but at least you went out so still okay
okay lah
then like that
hmm more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
oh ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that um what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
mm
huh
ah
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay lah probably
it's gonna be better
huh but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young lah
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest lah is like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
ah I was looking at this youtube um
the youtube is from america lah
yes
so it's like um
she
went to a nursery with
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear lah I don't know lah it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
there's a lot of different plants that um she feature lah
and then err the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent what no meh
no it's like
ah it's like a
um
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
ya it's like um apparently when the leaves are young
like
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though ah
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
ya it's quite tall
yes
mmhmm
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
cause I think it's like um you see
in a
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think um
um and there's no leeway lah
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
it like I think
it's not so healthy because
in their own way of keeping healthy lah so I think in that sense err that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
they actually force them to actually
mm
mm
ah
okay is okay lah but I think before
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation lah
mm mm
mm mm
err
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
mm
mm
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those um
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
um minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of err amenities for them to study which are like the laptop lah the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
girl in
ah ah
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her lah but for like elders other younger kids leh then how
ya
mm
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today lah I think there were also reports plus err like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
um
thought of
like
okay lah the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans what just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans what so it should be
um
encompass in all this care lah
but I think like
mm
mm
ya
ya even um
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
iphone ten
but more physically lah so
err that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
mm
no lah I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of lah I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
oh is it
oh
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on lah
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay lah I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
aiyo but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
hais
don't know what's gonna happen and
mm
I think
how can nature be a problem
that's
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay lor if you say so lor
ah
then there is a big issue lah
but I think like
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
but
ya lah but I still think lah confirm under black market so it's not that much lah
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything one
really what
mm
ya lah but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom what
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already what
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that what they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no lah I think
then animal go home lor
take the bus lor
no lah I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
buy one get one free
I think they kill it leh
ah
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also what and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
ah
you have seen it before what
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
should google it up the prayer plant
and err it's an indoor plant
err
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay lah
technically not really eh it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
um
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
ah ah
really meh I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it err refreshes the air ah NASA say one
really
ah
ah ah
true lah
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
huh
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
shoots ah shoots
oh
okay lah but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
okay wait ah
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
that is true hor
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong um so
what sort of plant got meh
coconut tree but it's not
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
oh my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
a bit different lah the milkshake
ya but anyway it's quite um it's quite a journey
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them um water the plant
like it they pouring into the side lah not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like wow like that ah
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk what
scotch tap hor it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
so I was quite amazed like oh okay you can actually do that
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care lah
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
no one lah not the standard issue plan lah and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
hmm
tomorrow I got dinner
it's quite
he wants to eat jinjja chicken
I don't know I haven't ask him where where to go
ya
ya
then twenty fourth you all got the christmas thing going on so that's also another dinner which is probably
err our christmas gathering lor exco base
ya
like cauliflowers
right the cauliflowers
ya I'm gonna do it at scott's house
chill lah whatever lah
I mean not whatever but
at least if it's a
outside location ya true
Q I don't know that's why we need to wait for the food
it's more comfy
I haven't buy present
I got two
okay good
hais
what's the theme
more than thirty
oh I thought usually if not more than
ya that's why really helping the economy good job though
ours is
buy something that starts with S
so I'm going to buy scott but my secret santee is fanny ah charlotte lah
but
I think I want to buy each of them a smaller present just to include everyone so
for scott I went to buy a packet of salt and the glow in the dark stars sticker that one
and I'm going to give him last
then will be like don't so salty here's your present
ya then therefore shanice I'm going to buy
school supplies she's also going back to school
err ya ah
doing comms ah
ya she was a victim so funny like I think she's not even a year at a new place then she quit already
then she was asking me about like the school life and stuff like that then I'm like okay lah not bad lah then sense a different lor different vibe here
ya but she's not that far off lah if you think about her age and the people there
youngest in amongst us

alright alright
few walks away so it's not really much of a big distance for us to cover
ya the kampung with the malays ya that place
no lah I think for them maybe is about
okay so six get already then after that we err
err until six thirty five then
yes
censored ya so sulaiman was there to pee lah then after that err not long after that lah my turn my turn because for us there's nothing much to do so all we do is go up there
drink lots of water so sulaiman will have a sweeter taste because he
drank lemon tea I I brought my dasani and then we just drink drink drink and for sulaiman he only peed once I peed
enjoy the enjoy
ya
that's life that's life
I see I see so so
sorry
ah
ah
uh huh
mm mm
seven ah ah mm
mm mm
pulau ketam lah
so you mean basically the uncle brought you from changi all the way to pulau ketam
so you mean to the jetty then taxi van mm
ya lah cause the way you say was like did I did I skip the taxi thing or like
ah
mmhmm
mm seriously
how sia
like saw sia
aduh aduh okay so the crabs err
ah
no fish no crab ah ah ah
mm mm mm mm mm
eh eh ah okay
wah same man wan five give me high five
mm okay alright so this wan one ah ah
supper Milo
one of a kind
wait the context this is taking place at where again
ah
mm mm uh uh
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
ah okay but three mm okay
okay carry on carry on
mm
mm mm
mm
mm mm
ah
ah ah I need to remember but ya mmhmm
mm
daring daring
mm mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ish ish mm mmhmm mmhmm
ish ish of course not nice
three three testing ah sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see ah uh huh ah
oh the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of pulau ketam from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in lah maybe a place I've never been in before lah
oo that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to punggol to already
orh aduh so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
oh here comes the big one and uh instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your pulau ubin story thank you so almost for sharing
err time check this one I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually err after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot lah I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit lah ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
lah kan lah kan eh yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months ah ah
okay so for now the same thing lah just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for err I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being err more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on lah
I think slowly lah eh because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed lah I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more lah ya so just err pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
err with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then inshallah when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck lah then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that err it's just whether or not approve or not if approve I alhamdullilah I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it lah if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application lah
err wah cannot I cannot think that means a lot already lah
err
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've err sent for has been
err civil service err healthcare err cleaning err
around those lah is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call lah
ya lah so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
the rejection is the best part ah silence which is the most annoying part because technically eh by right the most professional way for is
at caldecott area there err more of central macritchie lah macritchie reservoir ah so it's there
then err then
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that err we'll just keep in touch err within the week we'll call you back
err with every passing day err when the doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish lah like are you just playing my feelings want to play my feelings ah playing my heart
ah
so
so okay so basically err
then
ya so so that's the story lah the middle person err
err eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
my number to this err communications officer lah then err after that
is fandi ahmad fandi ahmad
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment lah so okay err I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
then mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
you know because for my for me err the the thing is me and this err officer
eh not call lah Whatsapp me say eh sorry shazwan we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
err so the officer said
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say lah err it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya
ya lah so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
that's why mm yes mm
the video lah kan the video
uh
mm mm mm ya
ah aduh
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense lah because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
mm mm mm
mm
mmhmm mm mm mm
err no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings err time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will
say our goodbyes alright I hope
err the fishing ah the fishing mine in the beginning right we already talk so that's why we like awkward a bit now now still awkward lah cause now we talking to you it's just
today is not we today we cannot say
err we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning oh damn

listener

so hopefully for you listeners out there I don't even know if you will listen or use it straight to the machine the will have to understand cause if they have to understand man eh
mm mm mmhmm
I want to say that's what they do but to be honest I only saw the ad on Facebook they say pay eighteen dollars per hour work from home I like
cause ya lah we we understand that through the trial we have to go through the trial first if we are successful then we can talk about the next step lah like we said as malay
it's been very simple but I think when it comes to the singlish accent will be quite
tricky on our end because for us being malays we will always have the mat-mat accent
but the mat-mat accent but I think
it's nothing is not like the plastic moved by itself or anything yes alright okay
it's too far you carry on you want no problem no problem you take your time
uh huh basically Foodpanda basically Deliveroo
Grab Foodpanda ah decent lah this kind of job ah
ah mm mm
mm
uh huh
if you if you not malay lah if if you really really do the extra step
your outstanding mm
around there yes
ah ah ah
mm mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya lah interview mm mm mm
ya
mm so if you were to times four for the month is one K your internship
but this time you can enjoy what you do cause your internship you have to listen to people say make changes but for you you make the change you go from one place deliver the food to the other
mm per day lah
mm
speaking about fitness I actually went on a hike two weeks ago
yes yes no no further no
I don't know how to say but I feel like it's further
close change the last part
I walk from my house I cut through bedok I reach east coast park I walk along the whole east coast park reach the gardens by the bay
from east coast to marina barrage two hours
because
you start from tekong around the area tekong and then you walk that extra mile tampines to here is your other one and a half hours
that's why it's long just join lah that's why I buy this thing
might as well park my

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
uh it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
ah kids also starting school soon
um
when
march eh eh march april
I I think so
because uh now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised
and uh we are in phase three
and I think some of the regulation and uh rules like uh have lax a bit lah
so I think they would allow us to do to uh the visiting this year what do you think
ya I think so too probably uh direct relative
and
ya
I don't know the the government haven't
ya issue any notice yet about
celebration
the thing you have been doing uh quite a bit of research these past few days and I've been
reviewing your proposal
so we can can consider some of uh the ideas that
we share in the WhatsApp
WhatsApp group
so I ya I think we should we should err you know
find some I uh
find the to get some quotation
what is err
what is your uh your your ideas for the renovation
uh minimalist
oh I
uh
I think open concept I I I'm okay with the open concept
uh
ah
you are my uh private
cook
ya uh I will buy all the ingredient
and then uh I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter um
you want a you want to put like a uh you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
uh the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because ah ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better lah because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and uh moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food lah
ya
and then
ya
uh
to to uh depends on uh
mm
kan ah
mm ya I I think you you think that concept
err I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack uh uh the what you call that the the wall there
err
and then you uh you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
oh okay lah
ya lah
you think because uh Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search
so I think
what what you are searching
they they know what you are searching so they are trying to match what you are searching
right
ya ya I think
the uh ya ya can
can can be done can be done
so
mm
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
uh multiple attempt to
uh kill them
they uh they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
uh it uh spraying the the lizard repellents uh spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too lah the our our house here I think
uh the it's there's a lot of uh lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient ah even though I've tried to to to hit them ah is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
oh my god so uh I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
ah
err
ya
ya
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time lah it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners uh I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity lah it's a it's a need lah more of a need
necessity because everything has err you know
wears down you know
and uh our our kitchen looks quite dirty and uh rundown and uh
our our the uh you call it the flooring starts to uh wears down
ah ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and uh they feature a few uh lah but uh so far three D contractors uh in terms of
the the the outcome ah it it it suits our taste ah
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
eh very nice lah we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but uh ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that uh
not not not the sink ah kitchen tap
quite a few lah and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus oh one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
to finish off the ah
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
aiya
I don't know lah it's both it is both uh frustrating and funny at the same time eh
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then err
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
uh
self guilt lah I think so I don't know lah
ya
cement
oh
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship lah
ya
ya the was
uh ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him lah probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain oh ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery lah but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
mm ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare lah how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how lah
which one we we want to choose
ah
so
mm
ya
major major lah
mm
mm
kan
one uh so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package ah
oh
ya
kan might as well kan
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
do it
mm
mm mm
okay lah thousand five ah eh
so I think ya lah
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in uh uh in the future we have uh
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
ah
ya
send me the one
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring ah
I think that one is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that one the the more expensive one
mm
but have to
you have to ya lah everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
if we have the the budget can consider lah I think that one's quite expensive is around
wah but I find it like very good leh
and it's wireless
mm
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
uh brands uh
uh have that those type of uh two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that one very good ah uh I think
can can consider lah if we have the means
but now we aiya we see how for now we just use manually first ah
use the sucking mop ah
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
uh sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive ah
ya that one really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence ah because like I told you earlier on
err ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence lah
ya
mm
the specific uh ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
ah ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well lah
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
mm
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally lah ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya lah like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
mm
mm
uh I think this saturday we we settle uh akid's uh school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare akid uh school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
uh the the the the renovation ah
mm so actually we K we we need to ya lah we ours we we are the one who should
direct them oh we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration ah
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but ah ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

but I don't remember the movie though
quite it's quite funny
ya
think it's at
one hour thirty minutes long
on netflix but then I I I only watch with like friends only ah
that was the last movie I watched
really they have that on netflix
a'ah
it's american
oh
well quite cool
eh there's this one story err superhero story called the boys I don't know if you heard it's quite cool eh
ya it's like a
ah no it's on netflix it's on amazon prime
ya cause I I I'm subscribed to prime right so like I I have like prime as well then I can watch it and then like he does a really good rating
so like
it's about like uh it's like a darker justice league like a more
it's I I don't remember but it's like it's based it's really
it's really like justice league tau
ya
it's like
amazon prime
I think I would say like the movie I mean the show is more like
uh like
superhero movies with like a capitalistic twist with ya like capitalism like human human ah affectist to it so it's quite cool ya I'm just at episode one though
I mean even if I want to watch also I can't watch ya
ah I don't remember eh is it
oh ya
no I think it was sixteen now it's twenty mine is twenty ya it's twenty dollars now ya

uh service marketing very fun you
I it's about it's very technical ah I I don't like it ah I'm not like really invested in that kind of stuff
huh
managing a business
it's called business management
is this like
business management with comms
ya just like one question like the running of it you know lah
it's quite interesting but like
with like everything going on at work like I wonder if it's even worth it you know like what's the point of it all
I guess
like what's the point to like doing anything
if the world is going to fall apart
business
oh that time
ya
yes still still there was still some profits ah it's that
ya now I'm just too busy with school so I cannot do that or inside job
mmhmm
uh now I stop already actually
ya I stop already
err a month maybe
and I didn't spend that much lah
I spend on three tens only
no recently ah recently only three tens
ya I better not gonna sell anytime soon ah honestly
feels like it's it's so much time and like
I I'm not gonna realise any any profits if I sell now definitely
cause right the state of the game now it's like so bad
oh then
honestly ah if it comes wrong then I'm I'm just like whatever man like
ya I'm really just like kind of like given up on the game already
ya just like I mean
the money somehow translate to that so okay lah
ya
ya
ya they should at least like I mean they should at least like balance it out what
I don't know like to keep like the business going and shit like that
I mean like you still owe it to but your customers will be like
they sian about how you manage the game
like reservice
ya
so annoying all these capitalist vultures
they are they are the main reason why is is this pandemic to you state that you please
there's always sole reason why
ya
orh
when was that
really
oh
what
huh
what the hell but it's still manual
no I think it's just him
it's always just him honestly
ya I mean like how the hell it's right go over like with like seven extra gig like I literally played with him few days back

snail god eh
okay I ask you this
if you were to be given a chance to choose between good looks or fit body which would you go for
for yourself and another person
as in like your soul part your
your dream partner
think if it were me
between good looks and a fit body right I would go for their credit card
that's the only only reason why you should be very
no I think
no I think good looks also I feel like good looks is more more sustainable
if you're superficial
if you're superficial
ya
ya I think after awhile you will get tired of looking at a person's body
I don't know think face is like more more personal and like more adoring right
ya
like
looking good ya
so what you're going to do after this
today or any other day
orh
you shave it jer lah
really as in like shave
how sia
when less less care about
why sia think you look good what
shaved head

annoying
but now your macbook is fine right or you don't not playing with that

mm I don't know about that
god
house with a farm attached
with a garage attached
with a arcade attached
it's all considered one
ya actually ya that that's that's that's really good
ya he have a house we can just chill inside doesn't leave it for anywhere
ya
people only people just work they get a house and then they die
ya but like
it should be free right
like houses housing
like nobody ask
before they just work
like this is the place
and you need a place to stay
so you make a place for yourself
that's why should be free
yishun
island eh wow
oh
uh what's the island what's the island by punggol called ah
you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by punggol I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night
it's only open in the day I forgot what it's called lah
oh yes coney island coney island yes yes yes
it's it's very near here
ya I can go
eh let's go
I feel like going I want to look for that cow
nobody knows
ya
I think it's more interesting how the cow ended up there
I guess ya
oo maybe ya
I guess what happened
I think I was thinking that like
kampong glam
wah serious ah oh I think I heard of that
eh
wasn't it our
oh was it
it's the one that you posted on instagram right
the one the girl with the bangs is it
right
oh ya I remember that
mm
ya
but
were they trying to colonize area
orh
but is it like a relatively close to like the surrounding flats
wah that's cool
mm
wah
that's really nice eh I want I want to move there sia
I want to go visit
I want to visit
but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big ah
the place
orh orh
orh so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside ah
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone ah
I mean alone with her friends
all the nature reserves lor
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun
think that's why they normally go at like seven eight so
ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near mandai area there it's like a hidden
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
yes
actually I don't know eh
the animals all wear masks
the features ah
oh ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
pulau semakau the place coney island
ya
can't remember
ya I mean compared to you lah
I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something kan
thing is three years is quite okay lah kan
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures
it's like
as in the big cats lah
they just like pacing around
cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure
then they just walking back and forth
just like restless
they should be free
it's still around right
oh ya
I forgot ah
what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
oh ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from yishun
you never went
huh
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four ah
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
orh
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what huh
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and changi airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on changi airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
hais
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be uh happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
oh shit
genie
you eh what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
huh
oh never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay lah I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
ah
what would I want
ah
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
uh
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
oh my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long eh from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
oh shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
oh ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
oh ya and that as well
uh huh
oh ya
I think you like got scanned use your and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the code is already enough what
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay ah
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all lah but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
ah
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
cat
ya
ya only when I
only when I go to like the east east east area like
pasir ris or tampines then
huh
oh no I haven't seen him for very long sia
ya cause when I've been like super busy with my assignments
ya but I'm like
I'm like going to
uh I'm planning to like going to see him soon ah also
wild cats
oops
sometimes I like my bed I'm like
ah I know what would be better me lying with a cat
just like cuddling
ya it is like sitting in a chair
ya
I think she's like
also like very
uh she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now eh
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy
now
last time I don't have it now it's like very sensitive
it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
oh ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya
but he had fun
ya I guess I mean he's he's not really like scared of it right is he
like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do lah
mm ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
uh human civilizations will be like
uh
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example lah then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like uh like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
uh issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
oh no lah like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff lah like taking care
uh like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like ah I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like uh like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
oh yes yes yes
that's so sad
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
if I was the judge I would say that
just
oh ya that's like really
oh why
okay I think we're gonna be done soon
ya okay ah next time ah

smart for me
I always do my work last minute
what the teacher teacher give me so many work to do
okay but I oh anyways I studied as much as I can and I got the good results that I wanted so
what
mm I think I cannot lah I remember when I was in primary school
the moment they stress me about studies I cannot function any more
ya
mm ya kind of mine wasn't give up I just cannot function
no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because kan
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day what
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous uh homework lah
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no meh
it's like
okay for example eh you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember what
until now I still do that
ah lah primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
same lah
ah think you know you are only one year older than me
so the timing is about the same
just saying
the changes is after me
what born
two thousand one
mmhmm
I don't like that let me surely you are young
oh I thought is
oh oh I thought the same ah lah sorry ah lah sorry
you just now say you talk enough my turn I okay lah you talk lah you talk
I just listen lah
faster give me something else to do
so annoying
ha so what I want to say see lah I forget already
oh I remember P one I was the teacher's pet
ya
but I think
a'ah cause I got bullied in P one
so I became the teacher's pet
the teacher just dote on you
dote on you
uh huh
I guess
sure
ya but everyone
no
like I remember she
she was my favourite teacher miss lee
cause I
okay okay okay
oh ya sure
anyways
she always like I think cause I got bullied a lot by these three people in my class
so she always took me to the staff room you know the staff room in primary school kan is out of bounds
ya but then she always take me in there and then I sit there at her desk go watch movies with her
ya
because in recess I think every every recess they always bully me
I can't remember lah but I remember got one time I sprayed water on my friend also
she sounds like me eh
mmhmm
mm
oh she throw there
ya
mm
mm
why
what's wrong with that
oh oops I also didn't think of that
it's not worry meh
I don't think that bottle is going to oh from eighth level ya ya ya oh ya ya ya ya
no
mm
ya ya
mm then after that
huh
I don't know I okay let's let's just end it I was a devil baby

that was me conservatory
okay tease me but ya
that time I still you know
mm I kind of miss my old self

then every there everyone there was so nice and I feel I liked it
so I just joined it
but it was kind of
how to say I don't think I want to relive my secondary school live
cause so much drama
oh
sometimes I was the middle actually it's hard to say lah there was this one big drama I think in sec four
I wasn't I wasn't in any of the side
but then I didn't I really didn't like it
ya
how to say
not the whole cohort lah but the whole
ya the whole
mm because we were the leaders what
like in sec four we're already leading the whole team
and then after that
got drama lah and then I was just like
ya and something that I wouldn't do
so when that person do I was just like ugh
was pissed off lah then okay I will just say lah it was hannah

ya
I almost lost a best friend
of how many years I don't know maybe ah since like primary eh actually we met since primary two but we only became best friends in primary five
mm ya
ya actually ya
true that

damn
your
your determination your courage in back in the army
you should be awarded the best soldier award unfortunately
my bad
fortunately yes unfortunately
are patient

okay um
you know I was wondering right
would you rather good looks or a fit body because I see like everybody
everybody especially now because we got like coming up soon
everybody are like they want to train and what not
I never really got a difference between having good looks and a fit body so personally which one will you
prefer
are good looking then
you lucky ah
cause you because
you will get you will
you can train you can exercise and you can get there
you get what I mean
so to me it's like I would I would prefer good looks
just because
um
okay lah err I mean
make sense oh going off of that
err
because you were saying like oh live a long live long life and stuff like that right
then
I was just thinking about it like the other day
then like
err
you know how the emphasis is all about the environment there right so it's like there were some like um
note notes lah about err extinction and all that stuff
then I was wondering how would you how do you think that humans will eventually become extinct
we we will go extinct the question is how and when
that that that last point that you made
you know I err
you know the game plague
the one where like you spread the virus and stuff
how easy it was to like spread a virus in the world
um
the the the
we're so interconnected lah it's it's to the point where
we are moving around too much
not to say is bad because it's just
at the same time it's like too much of a good thing isn't good lah
that kind of thing
so
like if you think about it
there are like a lot of viruses in
africa
but
if and when the day comes that people end up a lot more people end up um
then
partly because they are used to it
they are used to like this kind of thing so genetically and also government wise they know how to handle it
but then the rest of us we live in like relatively cleaner relatively more like virus free places
ya so I feel like that would be the one way that we would all be extinct
you know that that
in my in my opinion ah
err too many wants not enough resources
like we want too many things lah but
if let's say we have
like like the population goes down to a more to a lower rate I feel like that would be better for us and also for the earth
you get what I mean
we will be like eh
food and water and all that stuff so now we can
build back up and all that
that's in my opinion ah I don't know
but ya
but to be fair I feel like humans are quite resilient it will be a bit hard for us to go extinct
okay but then
err
enough with that deep stuff
ah this one is
realistic kind supernatural no supernatural later that one is superpower no no
realistic realistic
that's what I mean
any kind of skill lah like any life skill don't need to be specific to soccer or anything
okay
I feel like
second skill is basically about managing stress right
that that's the best way to put it right
then your first one would be
confidence
confidence in public speaking
then your last one is
err let me go by one to three err first one is confident speaking
second one is managing stress
third one is um
the hardest of all the three
okay let me give you mine first mine would be
first one would definitely be managing stress like that one in this world
ya
exam school
just general life stress and all that
if you cannot handle it then you're done for lah especially if since you play sports you know
it's like the anxiety before some people get
personally right
I know people who get like adrenaline
err
very pumped up very excited
but to me is like
it's it's a bit more challenging because
you go for competition then you are nervous and then
you are worried you start thinking about all the different scenarios and all that stuff
and
like
so there's no there's no really any need there's not really any need lah to be very nervous and all that stuff
so that would be that one skill that I would want that ability to
manage the stress manage the anxiety like before an important thing or anything lah that kind cause to me in general day to day life I feel like I'm okay
like I'm not very stressful over everything
but when I feel like I've worked some people gain confidence because they know that they work very very hard for something right but then to me it's more it's more like the more I work for something
the more I feel nervous because
like I put in so much effort already I put in so much time
and then if I mess up now is like wah all that time wasted all that effort gone
you know
so
ya
that's that's that's that one that's that one skill that I would want
and then number two would be
wah actually
I mean if if okay
one one skill would be probably
ya lah I will the the second skill I will relate it to my running
like
I mean naturally lah I would want to be running I would want to like have that ability to run like all those top runners and all that stuff like ya
that's that's the one that I can think of because
um
the the better you get at something
the more confidence you have in yourself
so the more secure you are about who you are like okay
no matter what fails like no matter how bad I am at something I know at at the very least okay this is something that I'm solid at
it's like our safe place ah like it not only does it take our mind off work but it also builds our confidence in that aspect
then you are like okay I need to go and like do something else but let's say if you are if you are if you want to do something else but you are also not very good at that something
I would like to be good at some like very very good at something because
I feel that it would help me
in my own self confidence
in that sense ya so number one was err stress management number two would be to be very good at
err running
then number three I feel would be
um
don't be so direct
like like I shouldn't be very direct because sometimes
I just feel like
aiya
don't bother lah just say it just say it even though like the situation may not be right for it
but I just say what I think
and
all humans got flaws right
so
the thing is
especially older people they don't like it when you point out their flaws
I'm not the kind that will like tell indirectly to somebody then that somebody tell the somebody I will just tell you straight and a lot of people don't like that
ya so those are like my three skills that I would like
ya ya
okay one more oh yes
anything like anything in the world
you know
you wish for it and it comes that kind
mm okay that's true
anything
uh
hmm
stocks
okay for me right
I feel like the one thing I would want free of charge
would probably be food
and if you can have all the money in the world right
if I had all the money in the world I would feel like I don't need to work
so sudden all of a sudden you have like all this free time and then they are like wah I don't know what to do with it
so in my opinion right
if I were to have one thing that was free it would probably be food
not money or like or like the ability to buy stocks because
like
ya if you had you had if you had all the food in the world
if you could get any single food in the world
you can one of course you can feed yourself you can feed your family but
in a larger like extent
you can
which is I feel would grant me a sense of purpose lah
in that sense
so it would really
ya
so
that's for me
then err
mm oh ya just now you mentioned something about superpower
remember when I ask you the skill
so let's get let's get to that question if you had if you could have any just one but any single superpower what would you have
what would you want it to be
I feel like
you know
that's something that I feel so
I wouldn't I wouldn't put that as a superpower because I feel like machines can make that happen
but to me one superpower that I would have would probably be to
would probably be
the ability to
you know how batman is you you read comics
you know how batman is like known as the greatest detective
because of his ability to like
read situations read people and all that stuff
and like look for things and all that
that would be my that would be the one superpower that I want
that kind of like intellect that kind of ability
that kind of smarts that would be the one and that kind of ruthlessness also
then that will be like the kind of superpower that I would want I I can't really find a word for it lah but
ya
because with that you can you basically can control everything
ya you would be the one person who know you will know your your
your opponent's moves before they even do it
which is like quite cool lah in my opinion
ya ya
oh building on that
then what superpower what super since you watch comics what super
hero or supervillain would you want to be
just one
I read both lah so
can be any
I mean you know mine lah mine would probably be batman lah
he achieves what he wants to achieve
and but he also has certain morals that he doesn't
ya
so like in my opinion if you are talking about still being able to stay human
it will probably be batman
because then you don't you you yes you have to face the expectations like
err comic comic batman
is that
err
in my opinion it will be batman lah
ya ya mm
they are labelled as
he can be very like aloof
he can very he can be very like distant when he wants to be or he can be very controlling when he wants to be
put on you
I mean oh so basically it is that concept of with great ya lah like you said lah with great power comes great responsibility in a sense lah I mean in this sense it'll be
the higher the the higher you go in a certain thing the more expectations people like people expect you to be a certain way people expect you to like look a certain way do a certain way and all that stuff lah that's essentially what you saying
okay I mean
that's true
that's very true all of us all of us
okay very true
okay personally I feel like
I mean the most common one for me is
school lah like they they
everybody just has this idea that
like
I'm
a very fit I guess same as you
except that it is a
I I run and in the school like I I'm considered to be like the the one of the better ones lah
and I feel like
that's
that's not very accurate
and
somehow also place expectations on yourself like okay
I have to sort of live up to the expectation
ya lah
so it's like outside pressure but also you on the inside telling yourself
okay I need to make sure like I I look a certain way I do a certain way I
train properly and all that stuff
but
or like how come your muscles not as defined that kind then you are like ah
okay I need to I need to go back and I need to work harder that kind
so in a way it can be bad
but if
you you you
if you don't
if you take it in a different light
you feel
ya
that's for me personally
I don't know
I I
ya mm
mm
what would your ideal day in life be
what would your ideal day in life be
given that you get your dream occupation and all that stuff
I mean okay
the difference is like like in terms of
you want to help like people and all that stuff right
then
like
training people
err
it gives me the most joy
so it I don't really think of it as coaching or a job I just think of it as
something that I like to do
like if you are talking about ideal day
coaching
then
while I'm coaching I can also be training
you get so it's like
then I can like go and run with like my my students and all that stuff lah we can run together we can talk we can bond and all that stuff
it feels like
to me I don't know about other people lah but to me
I'm I as a student would be more motivated
or I as like an athlete will be more motivated if I see like my coach is also doing it you know like eh setting by example if coach can do it I also can do it I should be able to do it that kind you know so I feel like
ya
but ya
is is is
it's fun lah
okay I mean
okay okay the one part that you said that I felt was important is that you are doing it for like the enjoyment of it lah you are not doing it for the competitive aspect of it
ya that's that's
something that I feel
it's something that I would never do
I will always
like
like like the reason why I will want to continue training is to compete lah that kind
you know
like maybe because like genetics and stuff I've never really had any problem with keeping with staying healthy
but at the same time
I understand lah that some people don't have that part
ya so I get where you're coming from

start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character lah
but why can't she the be so why can't she be clear
okay
so new sia
ah uh
mm
mm
mmhmm
clear about what he's getting
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
okay
mm because we haven't even consented to this relationship in the first place
cough up lah information
mm
mm
go into that yes
ya
okay
ya which you you might not but you might not agree ah
ah ah mmhmm
ya ya lah but I guess baby steps then after that
did you did you specifically say that
ya mm
hmm
ah
mm
a'ah seh
okay so
oh so just the informal ya
ah
ah
mm
you said
mm
mm
ah
okay
dayah's ah ah
mm mm
so fed up ah this type of thing
I don't think he even thinks like this lah
oh
foresight a'ah
did you say that did you say
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
are you sure or not salim I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
haiya
I mean I haiya I don't know what to feel about this
ya
send ya
must take this action
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether uh I
pushed or zina will be pulled down
err big personality how to say not big lah firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
your life will turn out well
ah
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to dayah
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with izat
huh you talk about marriage to izat like what
this was before lah
seriously
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
ya but zina can also ask you the same then why and why you and izat is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and izat are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya lah
ya lah because also also dayah always clamps her down
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya lah
ya ya
hidayah is clamping her down lah
ya ya
huh
ah ah ah where
you said that okay
okay
you said that ah then
ya
it's very hard and you will often require a certain mm
change of life events or certain

no lah it'll be inappropriate I'm sorry
ya a bit a bit inappropriate
so uh
what what was it ah
what was I talking about
oh ya
I haven't feed
my turtle
later after this after this
got fifty more minutes they can wait
ya
fifty more minutes until the recording ends
they can wait
I mean they they can go without food for a day lah so
so should be fine what
kan
ya
hmm
ya
ya
yes
ya
no no I don't mind lah
I mean hello kitty is japanese
then I like japanese stuff japanese culture
I mean
quirky what do you mean by quirky
uh huh
like your mug ah
oh that's quirky ah
then
so what do you mean by aesthetically pleasing but
no lah anything lah
you know actually I was thinking I've been thinking how how our house will look like
like if if we were to apply for the woodlands one right
as in
we we don't do like a proper
uh like you know those proper interior design stuff that sort of thing we just put whatever wherever that is
make it make it more unique lah like more us got more personal touch you know
like let's say uh
it's more of a mix and match kind of thing it's like
and not
you know but then still have a theme
but then like mix and match
ya
like maybe uh
you know how how I say I don't want to buy furniture but I want to make my own furniture
no why
you scared you scared not strong ah
huh
no lah
okay okay okay
I I finish talking already
what
okay like maybe uh I will build my own pond for my turtles
build own cage for our future lovebirds
uh huh
ah decoration you know
you keep like personal touch so what what what what
oh ya
hmm
what what what what what did she say
oh
ah
umah
why
oh
what did
ah
uh huh
and then
ya
chickens are not legal
no because
ya
like cats are also not legal in what
no like according according to the law cats are not allowed in but then the the the law enforcer
don't rely enforce it unless if someone complains
so ya but then for chicken right is ended I think
uh because it's a poultry meat
so like uh like they don't want
things like bird flu and all
spread
so that's why they they don't allow chicken
but then
I think
um because the law is quite new I think like less than ten years I think
somewhere around there
ya
but
I mean same same as
other illegal pets lah that are
it's got some people keep snake and all also what they ask people to adopt snake
ya lah obviously
ya
I
I want a pond for my turtle

then they can lay egg over there also
then we got more turtle

breed more I guess or

oh ya anyway talking about samsung right
we were talking about samsung
my mum got a new phone leh
she got a samsung S S ten like
S ten
S ten like
like like like my phone
like my phone but then like the small version okay so for example uh apple iphone
I think there was a iphone six S or seven S and then the iphone seven R or something got the big the small
I don't know I had
or iphone
X ah
ya ya ya ya the big the small
ya ya ya
ya ya
ya so I got the big one then she got the small one
I don't know she kaypoh ah
mm mm
samsung also got like that what
the iphone eight
um as in at where carousell ah
oh how much
see see see do you have it with you now no ah
oh then nevermind lah
iphone eight ah
iphone eight I think
a few hundred lah can
ya
ya lah
ya
hmm
nothing
I mumbling I mumbling

eh bro long time no see ah
not that ah actually cause I just got sacked ah by my company
ya ya you saw my posting is it
err around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful lah cause
I got to travel to different countries ah
among all the countries I would say
uh saudi arabia cause uh it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion lah
err
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
uh finding oh discovering new food there the arabic food was
I would say I would want to go to
spain ah cause ya I would like to go to spain cause
err I want to go to barcelona cause
whole uh football period uh resumes
uh
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
probably can last me for six months ah if I really err spend accordingly and safely lah and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
four thousand wah that I think that's a lot eh for a part-time job
oh I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
uh moving forward
it will be a tough period lah for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
mm
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs lah you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that lah cause as we um you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
err the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important ah in singapore
uh ya I get that a lot lah I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
err it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you lah but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided err you are not doing overtime or what lah
so ya two thousand is not enough lah at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that err or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling lah you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and um the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them eh sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children lah you know maybe
for err
ya I really agree on that lah we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know err
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right wah my house ah I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you lah to ah hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time eh you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
uh this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news lah I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry lah to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree ah there are multiple aspects that um lead to err emotional err depression
or probably um
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right um financial
uh issues I think is the most depressing issue lah
you know cause
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with wah sorry with whatever I'm having lah you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period lah for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think ah I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very uh depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also err came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID lah I mean some people
err actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why lah I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything lah that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
um hold the border
to some uh high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news lah maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
uh explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the uh about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
uh was tortured was raped in front of other people
uh
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
they you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they
torture all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's err moral morally right lah I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
err don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say uh history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being uh killed
err you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
err
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
err I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really err
being outcasted in what you think about that
ya I mean in every community ah be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it err it err really err bring a hole
intentionally in front of people wah that was another level of murder I would say lah
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
err we did have I mean we do have uh casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it lah
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such uh racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others ah you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist lah
ya I heard that um
the malays do have more privilege than uh comparing compared to other races ah know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a uh national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country lah you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example ah
you and your neighbour
and do you think you are treated fairly as as a citizen
that's what I heard lah I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean uh but then ya that's what I heard lah when you are chinese indian
uh sarawakian or sabah you know someone from sabah
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in I mean in malaysia
actually
a clinic I don't know you could err easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say ah but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be err it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being ah you know
they are they are going to get charged in court eh I know you confirm know ah who's that guy ah najib uh najib razak and some other
his uh friends getting charged at court cause
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years ah but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way uh you know they
they uh give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny lah but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
ah our ministers in singapore is acting and how uh well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very uh
I would say ah I don't know what to say ah it's very good lah I would say what you think about that
uh ministry like for example financial or et cetera lah and but then
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke lah I mean have you watch the singapore one
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister shanmugam and mister what it's called ah mister vivian balakrishnan the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
you being a minister you will only err how to say uh not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do lah you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with uh in a higher position right they seem uh they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it lah so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most ah I repeat again most ministers
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
huh so you willing to wake up in the
um
uh maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
err like I said lah having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
uh ya I mean I do agree lah on what you are what you just speak you know but uh
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past uh thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
err no I I don't
I mean I might sound
err like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships lah
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong ah
have have you even notice that you know this person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said lah I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
it's embarrassing ah I mean this is not some gender inequality lah but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that um ya actually women ah do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
uh have to lead them lah I mean I mean this topic is very err subjective lah you know but I think in singapore women are really um having a good career earning more than man I would say
um
probably ten thousand twenty thousand for your own wedding ah
I mean actually
and stuff and um
anyway ah it's a it's a good catch up with you I would see you again around
alright see you bye

okay hello hi ah amir how are you doing
huh okay ah
doing good err just I don't know
COVID situation
but the same for you lah you're also in army right so err it's just ah social distancing
okay
mmhmm
a'ah what are we doing now
okay understand
mm
ya
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
they take turns ah like in six
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see lah
ya
mm
yes
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh uh mm ah
mm
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
oh actually ah
ah okay okay good
okay lah
a'ah
err
I don't ah nothing much about it it's to me it's err quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause err
I post that like the last thing I said was err it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades ah
ah paradoxical kan
err
like it it
because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself ah
really your score
really ah I see
ah I haven't seen that
ah same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school err to secondary school lah
as of time
ya ultimately uh what happens err
what secondary school the person goes to will affect their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about err that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
uh huh
err these days like
like I don't read the news
ya
ah
ya
basically that's the thing
mm
err okay
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army kan
ultimately what is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
or
fireworks
I guess
so
err we come from then
we just talk to our own people lah
ah own circle lah ya oh ya
mm
ya these two years not wasted
ya so far
ya ah
ya err
so unless they went out of their way today
uh huh
mm
ah
mm
do anything else
ya true
ah ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in lah
but even in you can do stuff outside you can learn other skills in your free time ah if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
err so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
err which wouldn't be applicable lah cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn err can be applicable lah
err recently I went through this uh ammunition course
then err
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff ah err stuff related to storage
and uh inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
err
going out with my family that rarely happens
ah
oh ya it's it's different
I see
ah easily ah ah
okay mah
uh huh ah okay ah
that's that's true ah
most of the practical
ah
same
ah
family sunday
mm
err ya lah
for me I
I spend
on weekends mostly at home ah
I spend my weekends are mostly at home usually
this usually happens like on a whim lah
so
ya sometimes I just stay at home relax but at home
you talk to your family ah at home
ya
ya that's good
ah
a'ah ya really
ah
ya
ya
mm
good point ya the thing with me is that I have
err
more women at home than men
so ya I only I only get to talk to my father about it but then
every time I go home he always
ask me questions about err when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one ah like that err
ya but during err during
err the start of the
ya
ah then okay lah oh I forgot ya you registered at the same time as me
yes
yes
bro I only have two tickets dude
I only had two tickets
oh wow okay that's nice
ah must be western wednesday ah
of course lah
ten days worth of days
ya
ah
that's true that's true ya
ya
yes ya
uh huh
yes
uh huh
mm
that's cool that's cool wait
ah ya you didn't do twenty four uh twenty four kan
in tekong ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
hawker center ah
ya
they were like oh thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits lah we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but um is to is to
yes
ya
ah that's a good point ya they just did
ya
ah nine weeks and then next one nine months lah
ah eh I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you oh you're going to talk about the pay kan
so err to me okay
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
err back in kan my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but it's okay
ah okay
ah
ah
ah same
ah
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending lah
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
ah
mm
ah
mm mm
oh no me too
mm
mm
ya
same
yes yes oh my god
oh
election ah
ya
ya that's how it is but uh personally I also don't
err I don't follow that much
err I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates ah oh my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about but then finished already
so now they're talking about elections kan every day they will talk about stocks
wah buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive eh ah this one going up the percentages all
ya and err
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good lah I think it's good that
err more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
mm
mm
ya that's a good thing ah that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we err get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good lah
but the thing is that after this
we're going to go through how many years
err
you have to
I have to find a way to either make money or just I don't know I'm personally
no I don't want to burden my parents like honestly I don't want to burden my parents
like they're going to sponsor my I mean okay driving license is not that much ah
but they've been sponsoring my whole life honestly
so
for uni so they don't have to fork out more money for now
ya so
ya
okay
ah
ah
ya
mm
personally I I
I aim to at least save a excess of five K err by the end of
err because I I've I've made a lot of plans ah like I have the investments
and then I also signed up
I got I got tricked into no okay not tricked I got lured into
signing a deal with investment savings plan
insurance oh my gosh yes
a few bucks okay lah about a hundred every every month
that they will take
then save it saves more than a bank of course anything saves better than a bank honestly
interest rates well
so ya just apply and then
other than that I don't know what to do
like maybe I should also start taking down
err how much I spend
that will be better right
yes
mm okay
mm
yes
mmhmm thinking about it's
it's a rookie work yes it's realistic
uh huh
ah
ah
mm
ah
ya actually though
forgot
you're talking about
pay right leading into something else
was it
ya financially independent correct
mm
mm
carry your own weight lah
yes
mm
ya the thing is that of course okay family is written in my blood you know
the they'll be there for life but they won't be there for life like for your life
you know what I'm saying ya the
like eventually you have to live your own life ah so
err you have to start eventually
and now is a good time to start being independent
ya we can yes yes we can that was the idea
that was like we were going to talk about food
ya I don't know it's you it's you you brought it up yes
what ya I don't get it
and like okay in school or like even now
people can talk so much about food I I don't I personally don't get it like wait have you tried this thing
or have you ya
not dude err not about that but what what did you ask amir
what's my favourite food oh snap
err my favourite food is
the scone from texas chicken
the scone the biscuit thing
mm ya
ya
ya
oh
that's true that's true
for the taste or
nugget okay continue
yes
a drumstick
ah
huh
a'ah
ah
yes
ah
ya it's booming
yes
I do too I do too
ya same ah
so you look at malay people you got the highest obesity rate
highest diabetes rate probably I'm guessing
yes it's delicious
okay ya it's not so good for health
ya
you said comfort food right
ban mian ah ban mian
ah okay tom yum
ya
what is like the maggi tom yum
ah
ah
yes that's true
ya
okay understand understand
mm
just so and so ya
when secondary school miss the pe pe
err swimming lesson kan ya then after that
everyone including everyone has maggi
yes
oh my god ya
ya
ya that was the times
ya
it doesn't fill but yes okay maybe back then maybe in primary school in in early secondary it fill
oh it's it's always bulking season it's like in it's it's it's mean
what thousand calories let's say ya ya thousand calories and I think that's not even enough for me
cause of the amount of work I do everyday but it's okay ya it's a eh that's another thing ah
err
sometimes okay there was a point like when I was studying for A levels right when
I was eating almost purely for sustenance
like I was just buying the cheaper stuff like err
what saying yes
wah
are you serious I went up by sixty ah
oh my god
ya
comfort ya it was comfort also okay okay okay
ah
uh huh
yes
ya that was the essence
mm yes it's true
huh
ah yes ya and I didn't mind I didn't mind it
because it was a perk for studying
no the thing is that I mean for sustenance because
I mean it because I would spend five hours inside an aircon room
just going away at my books
or okay I don't okay lah I cannot read for that long but
ya reading and writing doing exercise for five hours and then after that
because I need to eat I will go out and eat
ya so
then after that go back to study ah that's that's what life was like
err doesn't matter as long as it's food
and it's cheap cause money was
I mean okay my family is is in a fortunate enough position to not worry about that but
considering how much I got per month yes
oh oh my gosh oh my gosh
yes
ya and then non muslims also queue up
ya
no but I think it was it's fucker level it was fucker level
and
it technically was illegal in school canteens but it doesn't matter it was good and everyone liked it
ya used to be a secret menu item right
yes
ya
ya
yes
yes
mm
oh was in the canteen yes that's true
I never skipped lectures by the way
that's a that's a very good point yes
no I sleep during lessons that's the thing
ya oh my gosh
the thing is that I still sleep during lessons even now in
nothing has changed
err except I have to study less now so that's good I guess
err no nothing nothing too complex I can make sandwiches but okay
but I still make sandwiches if you think that it's just
taking raw items and putting it between two breads no there's a lot more to making sandwiches the
just take and pop
okay lah even on the pan okay fine I'm making it sound like there's more than it is
yes it is
it's not ya
ya
ya
mm
do you cook
okay
I remember yes
I get that a lot
a'ah lah
yours was half a bite sized
experiment ah experiment ya
ah that's true that's true
a'ah
ya you don't you don't think about that lah as a as a new cook even
yes
they'll just tell you how to do things easiest okay sometimes they does
but even then even then you have to create ourselves
yes
yes ya pretty wholesome
and he dodged my mum
a'ah
ya
eh was that was that trip just for me
oh my god
ah
okay
okay
yes ah
my gosh that was mad you oh wait
ah
ya the things you do I I haven't done anything like that in a long time like
I find myself not doing very kind these days I mean I do
like if I see opportunity like err
for example aunty needs to bring her bags outside the
ya like that I help but
err ya I don't see
like when it comes to friends I don't I don't I never see anymore
mm
ya
why is it
uh huh
okay
mm
ya
ya so
you doing the thing ah doing the thing
yes
yes that's true
yes ya
ya that's the that's the that's the silver lining in helping others lah
that you have to consider their personal dignity
like when I do volunteering also I go to people's houses and I clean their house
there's certain things that they will say don't do this
don't don't wash my dishes that's not for you to do that's for me to do don't mop the floor I can do that
can you just paint the wall
or like reach for the top because I cannot do that
yes
ya so when you help others
like especially old people they only want you
to help when they really need it cause
they they still want to feel able
like putting it bluntly they still want to feel like they can do things on their on their own
ya
mm
ya
ah yes
mm
ya so ya
I don't know I don't know how it got here
ya
ya food
it's not a question okay
uh huh
and that affects the taste
okay I don't know man I don't know
okay
oh yes
yes yes very true very true
yes
ya
fast food lah fast food is easy
mm
ramen
right
yes they can they can appreciate their prices because they're halal ramen stalls
ya
ya
yes
mmhmm
okay ya I think correct ah
ya you can have your pork
ya it's okay ah it doesn't affect me
ya I'm not it's just when I go out with them
ya like I'm your I'm your limiting factor when you decide where to go
but no they say they don't mind though
they say they don't mind
but do they though
ya a couple of times I've I just followed them to where ever they go then I just sit in
ah buy drink buy drink
ah
that's true
yes
not ice cream inside
ya ya your mum always that to put something inside but but I stopped buying I stopped buying though
ya it is it is
ah ya like where we are right now ah
yes
so much
yes yes
oh bro ya ya ya it's okay that was an easy option
and they don't mind ya I mean ya they don't mind
that's true that's true
some will say ya like
ah err halal lah so everyone like once it's halal but then
a lot of the halal food is unhealthy especially malay food
ya it's quite ironic
ya I think ah yes yes malay the malay malay food
ah that ah
ya ya it's very obvious ya
found another fucker
ah
yes
ya
yes
yes malay community
err my gosh like you ask your malay friends
ya it's older generation lah
but you can change the recipe
ya
ah that's true
ya
ya
but they don't ah
ya
yes ya and it tastes nice that we have
ya
uh huh
oh oh everyday
okay
okay
oh so wait the reason why you bring your own food is because it's healthier is it
okay
that's nice that's nice that's nice
sushi okay
err
I'm not sure about that but I think it is also I think it is
ya
definitely
ya by a long shot
wait or oh sashimi itself ya that's true that's true
oh my gosh ya sashimi is so nice like I
ya
have it more often
yes
bubble tea hmm
nah dude okay ya I get it like a lot of people
err I'm not a big fan I cannot appreciate bubble tea
like I I can taste it if
I mean like it's okay if friends are getting it together right ya then I'll chip
I'll buy along ya it's a social thing social thing
I wouldn't get it actually no I do get it on my own sometimes like if I feel like it
but my bubble tea preference is very small
I wouldn't buy the
I wouldn't buy the the tea flavours
ya so
I'm more smoothie I'm more smoothie
ya the oreo crush lah oh my gosh yes yes
Sweet Talk
ah closed
ah
ah
ya
ya student card lah which I still use by the way
no it's not legal
I know
ya imagine if you are out for the whole week how much bubble tea will you buy
yes
ya that's that's the thing
no after we right
err everyday you'll be out like imagine if you go out everyday
like the amount of money you lose compared to the amount of money you save if you signed on six months
is insane
ya ya extend the contract
I don't know no no no I'm actually thinking about it like the six months two K two K plus per month
no no no joke no joke
ah yes yes
I need money bro no but I realise kan
ya
ya
and earn the same amount of money lah
ya
but is easy you're ya you're already there
ya
mmhmm
cooking
let you learn other stuff ah
it's not
ah
huh
I think ya lah definitely

okay uh my name is
iman salihin also from singapore poly
year two also doing uh marine engineering
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
err okay first
uh higher NITEC but then I found out that uh
I got a chance to go ah because my
three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly err through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
like why why are you not uh interested
mm
uh
what else
okay uh so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay lah
ya
for me is uh
uh
actually from
from till now I just keep changing
apparently now is muay thai
which I find uh more interesting than the others ah in terms of
err social connection and all that
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because uh
I guess now muay thai is going well so far
uh training quite intense so ya
oh
competition uh
not not a performance kind of competition lah
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
mmhmm
okay secondary school life okay actually because err
so
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it ah and I go through it ya you go
mm
ah
so
is naughty eh
uh
my choice ah because err sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
secondary school that is known to be
uh for like naughty kids ah and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the uh the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
why you never go for the interview and all that
he's like oh ya ya you're a student counsellor what ya ya so I
wasn't expected ah but then I was just like
okay lah never mind I just I just take the role lah do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like err
naughty stuff that I did at least
ah
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
other then that uh not much ah
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
ya like I think right after N level ah
still retail the the best uh job that I did lah as experience because okay I started
err in twenty seventeen which is err N level twenty seventeen after N levels uh
I join uh because a lot of my classmates work there also
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun lah for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent ah because usually
err we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
mm
oh
a lot
mm
mm
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also ah and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
mm
so
err actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then err so compared to retail
err in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then uh imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like err how how can I help you then they like oh no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes ah then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king lah
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did err
photo booth err
kind of job
and then
the pay was quite good ah like three hours
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
which was fun ah I got experience a lot
uh ya
that's all for the job experience ah
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute eh
it was terrible but uh
err I think part of
the job experience also is why we
uh business and all that
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
yup
ya
yup
shore
mm
so six months sailing
just one month of it how how can I cope lah
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of uh career
for me
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore err
exciting ah
ah
so think is okay lah
to have a stable living ah for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family lah
nine to five job kan
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
to be really you with your family ah and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
mmhmm
yup
you can pull down ah ya you can come back to shore maybe err continue as lecturer I you relax ah ya
mm
okay
mmhmm
ya
uh
so uh
police
uh it was a
ya
and it was like
oh what what yes
uh
that sense of err
ah ah
why ah
ya
frogmen
mm
so
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
mm so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test ah
mathematics lor they call it arithmetics
uh
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
err at that point of time
pay is
but that's the air force ah I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
uh
so
but
mm
mm
then hopefully just continue marine engineering lah
the different opportunities
ya consider
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup uh I I don't mind any uh what you call that like areas ah
mm
ya
ya
so
ya
but ya
what else
mm
what about copy ah
primary school life
spent there six years eh primary school
which are compared to our different stages lah
ya
ya
ya
mm yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending ah
ah the jump style
it's about err other than that
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
I was quite small in terms of size
err whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said oh you you sub the big one with the small one ah
but I I didn't mind lah because I know my potential and then from there uh
so
by primary
ya so
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
so so ya
ya
tekong
uh depends
okay usually striker is on your on the tekong's right
and then feeder is on the tekong's left
ya
usually striker and jumper for right leg
ya
wah I think after almost ten years playing
uh
I mostly play either tekong
ya
ya
the thrill of competition
and then uh
gain my own confidence lah
primary eh
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
err that was like the our best performance
for the senior team lah
uh
uh and I also think that's important lah because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until uh finals
uh
oh
east zone is junyuan primary
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
uh is qihua qihua primary
and
either qihua or junyuan ah
but
ya junyuan is the east zone
champions ah power house
but
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like err even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like uh
personally I felt was possible lah but it it came down to my
my uh my team
that day first
first team
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
that was so it was
I I lost ah it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
uh if
if err one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
err we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
eh but ya
ya
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us lah
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
uh
it was a big accomplishment lah
but ya
okay
performance
mm
oh okay
okay
ya ya ya
is is a very big accomplishment lah
congratulate lor
which is demotivating ah
yup
yup
I think
ah that's why
no
so
no
okay lah uh so
ya together with someone
uh
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
uh
this overseas trip
uh it was a service learning trip lah
so
seven class
so
she's from err two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
uh
so we went to this overseas trip then
uh I tried to make friends ah then uh
one of them was her
mm
back then I was just like making friends with her
then
I think after the trip
then I was just like thinking about I was just like
she's a nice person and all that lah
and then uh
we were we were quite close after that trip
and then uh
during sec three
uh we
we were in the same class
okay then
from there started to talk more often and all that
it was just to me like a
ya ya
so
uh
late sec three
that that guy just wanted to play games
like as in like like like literally play game
ya so he's a gamer ah
ya so when he play game he also never tell her anything so she left on read
so ya but then ah
I think during N levels uh we studied together and all that
after N levels we somehow got together lah
for what
to ask
uh
obviously I ask ah
ya ya but
but ya she's
she's chinese
uh
she's christian
ya
and then
so
she's the opposite of me ah basically in terms of race and religion
because I'm malay uh I'm muslim
but she's chinese and christian but
so far I I look past that ah
but I still see a future lah is just
how things will work out
but ya
how about you
okay
but okay
mmhmm
ya

okay I think we're recording
err so my name is Umar and my conversation partner today is
so
so okay obviously okay I start eh so basically um
then after that um when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in Jakarta err celebrating Chinese new year lah
um the the the hype so called or the whole issue err it it went up and then
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore um and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then um the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and uh at first I was going to work and slowly um you see more and more people
um we were eventually taken over by um okay eh at first it was China lah and then second it was Singapore
at first ah this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries uh in Italy
is the highest lah so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
err but that's how I remembered my experience um when it first started err and how at that point of time I was
let's put it like um I wasn't employed anymore err after this whole situation so now looking for job lah
some authority figure ah
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
ya and
I think
and say that uh you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen err
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say err I understand
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that err gone viral for no reason
um
Hadi dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see Hadi kan
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny ah but I saw the article lah I think Mothership covered this article about him
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes kan
because if you think about it um just the fact that during this whole uh circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
err actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
err the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
mm mm
mm well I have this opinion about uh all these food delivery ah so to my understanding ah
but err food delivery eh so I feel that um it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all um
and they are blue err blue collar workers kan so think about this for a second eh to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to um like basically if you apply kan most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for uh the lower income group to catch up
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it kan so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar err job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about err food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day lah for example on her electric err wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is ah okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is um you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet lah
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to err
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway um with regards to that uh there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
err err employment
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis lah in singapore so whether you are uh as mentioned before whether you are
err low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide kan
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver kan
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab err you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your err err picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really err let's say you already have a bicycle lah let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
so it it simplifies a little bit
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
it has that sort of it extended flexibility ah and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way lah it's just something I just thought about recently
maybe err do a three hour trip err three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home lah so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
uh as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that um a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such uh active um kind of employment especially for the lower income uh people to help a bridge to the higher income people
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
err it does
um so during the circuit breaker period of pe was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing um did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery err did you meet anyone or
oh okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
no lah if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say eh I'm doing this err exam err next week
err I pay you two hundred dollars lah just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay pe
seriously
right well characters is something inevitable
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
I think also it depends on school as well ah because when I was in uni uh um a lot of people who went to like me kan they err
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
so in a way you can balance oh out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but err
sometimes err if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
err for a couple of years you actually um understand and appreciate what err higher academia can bring compared
to your peers err in school at the moment kan even for myself kan if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and um if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or uh it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
um you know it's the uncertainty of err okay lah
you know if I don't do well then don't do well lah you know but uh once you are in a position where you are out
is very exhausting and um some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful err well kudos them
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks lah toilet lah
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people um
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
err I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
um if doubly is even a word for studying
so aiya I mean so
I don't know eh ultimately it is a state of mind lah so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type err Foodpanda pro
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but err if you go now it's definitely available
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well Nurul didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker lah so it's a different story but for those people who
suspect until the end of the year ah
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went Jakarta once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February what
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in err late January it was Chinese new year I had to go Jakarta but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or
no not May err April or something ah it didn't happen anyway so ah whatever lah
just need a break cause okay if you think about it kan people other than Singapore
who
ah that one is err he was so desperate for diving that one also is
ya
yup
nope it says err fifty seven minutes
on my timer
ya
so man I don't know now
you you're only as old as you feel
sleep is for the weak having said that I got a class tomorrow at nine thirty
what am I doing recording this at two in the morning
you you go for more class I'm going for volunteer class you are going for to get re-educated upgrade education
you paid for
I use I use the SkillsFuture is paid for
I still had to pay about err thirty plus dollars that's all just uh a top up ah
twenty five thousand dollars ah jer
I paid more for my education in my uni hello
but but I already paid my loan so I'm good no problem
what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
hmm
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour

all right
ya
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit ah
is it
shit
I don't know what went wrong ah honestly ah honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic ah I was like
even if I was the instructor
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit ah
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike ah
but apart from that
I think
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know ah cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
and I accepted it lah ya but today
um I started out with the mini circuit
like it was me and it was that that that that girl lah so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance ah maybe today I might pass ah that kind of thing
but no
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
then I said oh then
then why I cannot the same ride again ah
so
oh so that was me and then about that girl
she was um she was okay she she also failed
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back ha so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
and then
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there lah
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place eh I already down to gear two already even before that ah
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there ha my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that lah that's why he stood there
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
then after that uh she was trying to pick up the mood
no I was still on my bike
ha instructor instructor was there all the while ha so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
ha you concentrate or your bike ha you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall ah because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver lah maneuver the the turn but she
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
ha cause it's it's a bend what
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no lah I'm okay lah okay
then after that like
after that uh when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
uh the instructor tell me he said uh
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her kan he say you just go ahead first ah
ha prac one
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
when I got the results I was like
the fuck sial
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
no to me
really meh you use your foot brake what
really
huh
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
oh class two ten seconds slower ah
ha
but you but on on on gear one right
ya lah half clutch ya actually can what
is it
serious ah
ah
harly from this cafe racer you going to change to harly it's a big difference you know oh bobber bike kan that one ah the mutt the mutt the mutt but mutt is what country eh is it mutt ah
mm
confirm ah
ah
just jump to three hundred plus or try to go close to four hundred ah
ya lah that's why
bikes is it was it bikes there was one retailer there was one retailer that sells that bike
mm
huh who
oh
sanfu ah
paya lebar
for the mutt the mutt ah how much
excluding
machine price
oh inclusive a'ah
last year's was how much
ten thousand plus
ha
that bike is expensive ah
zontes cheaper ah
huh the mutt thing
zontes
ya ya ya
the resemblance is there
you are listening ha
sell out your bike first
mm
mm
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
mm mm mm
I think that you should consider that
there are many people who have class two bikes ah
but they all stop at super four
don't know
they just don't know they just don't about
it is it is it it
when you see their their their their how common the bike is ah on the roads ah that tells you how reliable the bike
super four there are people who bring super four which country in indonesia and come back down also also no problem super four quite normal or not ya
no I think it's six hundred hmm mm
four hundred two to two hundred to four hundred right two A
but but the the the the aesthetic of me to say
ah
is it
ya
huh
per two weeks
oh engine oil to oh you change ah ya that's about two weeks lah
sixty
oh ya ya ya mmhmm
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four four
that one S four that's why they call it super four
mm
forty eight ya
for every
ah
that's why you must get air cooled bike
get the tourer ah get the touring bike
get a short touring bike
uh
it's nice
it looks like bro
eh but do you see the that one that day I showed you or not
it looks like the zontes right
but ya ya the zontes is bigger uh
one eight four one eight four is a honda one and because it's the same engine as the as the tourism and the five oh but
fifteen I think sixteen litres ah
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty
oh desaru
it's as good as you are dead because it's not cheap you know to tow the bike over um
I don't know how much ah malaysia to singapore lah but uh three hundred always eh where you are lah it goes by distance what
wah
then how
the risk is there but that's why I said
mm
don't know
ah
huh
no
wah serious eh
ha ha benny rios ha
with who ashik ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm

so
even when I was
even when I continued doing uh when in woodlands when I was staying at chinatown
it's possible lah
I remember three point two E brake ah
fail
no I think uh exceeded the line got exceeded the line
the back also
but the the pullback you will feel lah because your engine breaking is active what ah then you really feel the thing on the the whole bike were you'll feel the jerk ah
no my last was uh circuit division
wait lah
and then the second one uh no actually I took I took I took the circuit assessment twice
after the after the salem salem plus kan
I was I was I was joining ah
I signal
I signal I saw the lorry was there but was quite far lah
I don't know what happened I
what I did was I went to uh I went to throttle I think I throttle too hard or don't know what lah
because I'm on gear two what I didn't stop I want want to actually don't need to stop didn't ask me to stop but it's give way what it's not
it's not uh it's not a stop line
so I went to throttle but I think what happened was the the there was skid mark on the floor
so I throttle the whole bike went this way sia
I cannot turn
too fast already ha so just one thing slip so instead of the bike flying
so I fell out with the bike was on the ground already you know engine still on ah bike was on the ground eh no no engine like stop
then I remember I sat down I sat down I adjust my helmet I turn the lorry still moving
still moving then
and I look at the bike and I
then he you start to came out of the lorry I don't know what after that he say ah sir are you okay I say ya but you hit the bike not me ah I said I I fell off earlier already
I said okay
and then the instructor don't know from where he came my instructor ah I don't know how he suddenly just turn up because he was actually at the E brake side I don't know what he was doing here
he came to me he asked me like okay or not I said I'm okay
that was the that was the last one
I I don't know
I was not
nothing ah nothing ah
should be school what ha
it's a learning school what
then they need to have insurance for their cards to be brought in for lessons in the school
because not every not every
ha
ha
motor
oh
but for
but to me I always have that feeling I I I don't know to me I think circuit is harder
but circuit is like
they just there to give you ah
a'ah sia
three minute
ah chefs
lima
a'ah regular regular mild ah
is extra spicy
and that's why this one
ha
if you want cheaper a bit you pass ah bring a bottle serious ah
I don't buy I don't buy go there and buy ask them to deliver to my house
I cannot
probation
what is it they prohibit you from I just don't understand you're stupid manager
ya I know whether you find new job or not
so after I took her number I after she give me her number I went to
I went to level four because one of my friend was taking daily lesson
so when I went up he was still there then I ya
when I knew it was already eleven plus eleven fifteen you know
then okay
so I spend another half an hour
and I mean I would have gone home on my own lah but
I didn't want to spend
so I just waited ah I waited until twelve o'clock
so by the time I reach back home
I was she was still texting me ah I was telling you everything what
then uh
is that dino
and then she said because she's been driving for many years already
then after that uh she was telling me ah no then
she ask me whether I was in contact with anybody from the deliveroo
then I said I said not really only sophie ah and then I don't know about you I say were you still there then she said no lah for some time already I'm not there I think she left
in october or something like that last year ah last year last year october
but dayah ruby all went before her
first round of of of retrenchment dayah was the head of customer service ah
ah
we used to order lah we used to order for dinner
after nine plus
per person ya
okay
normal lah
mm mm
now
is
clear cut dishonesty sia
terrible ah
of course ah
ah
you told me this one you told me
this one you told me but when was this this year
dayah smoke or no
I never seen her smoke ruby smokes dayah I don't know
I mean you know honestly what lah just she's just
kan I told I told shida and her off before what shida and ruby off before at the office I think that from there already they won't come in I say you all you all treat the office like a playground
you know I never saw them in the corporate world
mm
but long time ago you still there lah
but I think on the day you were not working I I I didn't like shida from day one one
to me shida is just
a nuisance
I don't know how she was in youtrip ah but in deliveroo she was terrible
character wise
but ya lah that's the that's the that's the whole
and then rational why I I kind of didn't really like
I mean
I took that job because
and I came back from europe I had no job like literally nothing
and then I'm like ah then I had to sign the the the stupid huh no last time attendance kan sign that that paper right what the the one in the hut the hut the hut
whatever lah
mm
and then um I was sitting beside
um sophia B
then
ya I don't have I'm like
where is she you also don't know where ah

um
ah so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
uh huh
so other than
when you
ah yes so is so now when you see for yourself eh actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
ah I enjoy eating it which is something good lah kan hopefully
you can cook ah more things lah
ah exercise more ah exercise more in the imagination lah in reality I won't exercise
ah yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
eh this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya lah ten years ago still can play lah but now I think it'd be better
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play ah maybe
ah if I play football with
ah I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become lah
doubt so lah I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it lah don't want to waste my energy ah
during the malaysia cup ah
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over lah first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
ah whom is like
and the passion is just not there lah I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities ah
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
ah football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
for the money for the fame kan then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
ah in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
ah I can just ah imagine myself to be ronaldo or messi
on the screen
kan if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers kan
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
you can basically
contact with the with the people
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things ah um
uh huh
yes
ya so that is the different lah people change
kan so maybe certain things will be left behind lah
ah
ah
ah
ah
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time lah kan cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
ah impossible ah kan ah
okay um
yes
ah behind kan then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
ah just nice for his ah
or his or her development
in the future lah even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
ah ah
yes correct
ah
um
ah
ya lah
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
ah
ah but in terms of travelling
ah malaysia kan
ah ah maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia ah
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
ah um
ah favourite place ah favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay lah our singapore dollar is strong lah then
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe kan
but it's a really complete
uh shopping lah
for the clothes only lah
ah
ah
ah
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay kan but of course there is there different lah when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new kan but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is ah is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
our kid also will enjoy it more also lah kan
uh but
yes ah
ah ya lah you will set the goal when you go ah
ah ah
ah I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part lah kan
I mean
ya lah I think certain things you are more
ah
comfortable in handling and
ah certain things I am more comfortable in handling lah I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
ah planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
ya lah ah when authoritative-ness then
people don't argue with you
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
ah then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
ah
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay lah
ah
we are realistic lah kan what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over lah I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small lah but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it kan so that is the difference
ah ah
ah ya
I think for the jakarta one
when we reach
there we were like eh
first thing is the airport lah
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
err shopping centres err in the eighties kan
so okay lah that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
uh
ah
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
ah something being kept for so long
it's not rotten ah it's like the carpet never wash for so long
ah lah
quite enjoyable lah in jakarta the
different way of life

kuta beach ah
it it is the way they set up the kuta beach

the cleanliness of the beach

ah
ah mmhmm
ah
malaysia ah
a'ah
yes ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
older lah ah older
but the penang one could have been better cause if not raining
four families cut down to three ended up to two kan ah
ah
if there is a travel restriction
ministry of foreign affairs will be alert
and they will say
ah advise people not to go there ah a'ah
yes
I enjoy the food down there
ah
home of P ramlee
penang yes
ah ah
ah
ah like very interested to talk to to us eh ah
ah
ah yes that one is the the tower
ah ah ah eh they say what
they emphasise as the biggest
the biggest curve
in southeast asia
ah it's the biggest
ah
ah scared of heights ah
ah
but if I yes
ah
ah that time the new attraction they haven't finish doing yet ah the new attraction they
you can be you can I think you can do flying fox a short
flying fox lah then outside the building
that one they haven't finish yet ah I think if that one already have I think you can forget it about raja going on it lah ah
that one is the bukit bendera
ah ah yes
ah][ah um)(um
ah ah ah um
ah ah ya
but it was very bad remember that time even then malaysian chief
the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
when we are inside the van kan we can see the certain places which was
ah damaged lah due to the due to the flood
ah then one thing about penang ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
they conserve so they make it part of the building kan which is ah a bit
but
conserve for the sake of ah conserving ah sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them lah cause they did conserve their ah
upside down museum ah um
singapore rediscovery vouchers ah
hopefully it's worth it
life go back a bit more to normal ah then we can start our travelling plans at least travel plans doubt so lah other countries we cannot control kan
but hopefully in singapore we can can do it lah eh
at least meet up so we won't be so
ah no new cases ah
a'ah
ah ah shopping centre
ya lah ah
kan ah disposable shoes disposable clothes then
okay so other than travel
ah in year twenty twenty one lah kan lah what would be
your wish your hope in twenty twenty one
mm
ah primary two hopefully he will do better than in primary one
ah
mmhmm mmhmm yes
family members ah ah
so other than that for me is err ah
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
ah maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated lah trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
I will go with the majority lah and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue oh then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
ah
a'ah
ah
eh lah
a'ah
mm
ah
ah yes
ah
ah
ah yes
ah cousin ah
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best lah
I I submit document I submit application
ah
ah
the thing is is like that
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother lah kan
have to go through a lot of places lah
the future
you have to go through a certain
authorised by us to do the ah assessment so go through check up again
so um um
ah ah
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done kan
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then ah
I think now is
ah
involved ah uh huh
ah do the best that he can be ah
enjoy enjoy what
ah make try to make his life ah
meaningful lah that is what
ah
ah
ah ah
a'ah
a'ah
um um um
um um um ah

poly ah
uh ah
a'ah
a'ah

all this lockdown ah like europe ah like our friend ah our spanish friend

but that one that one more worse you know they cannot even go out to have a job
oh ya they cannot go out have a job lah only and and they very control lah
sometime you can only go out for one hour go buy groceries then you come back

oh ya all that
so spacedays mission complete ah
eh you got or not your mix ah later we can listen ah
oh ya lah the raw the classic sound ah
um

ya of course
ya must make things exciting ah
for for not just for the band for everyone ah
uh

wedding ah actually wedding marriage I don't know ah but is sucks to you know ah must focus on the wedding sia and it's only stupid sia one day only
wedding
but they all working what lah they never

not alone cause couple you can get a lot of err loans and err whatever other stuff
ya
ya

for I don't know twenty four hours or less than twenty four hours sometimes
then you chao what you chao to next city
ya
ya of course
power ah
ya
very sucky
ya
ya
ya but the best I think
after you play then you make friends
but then these people become your friends then maybe next time you can visit them I mean next time you can go on tour with other bands it's like that ah it's it's it's creating a network ah
ya
ya

yio chu kang punggol eh yio chu kang sengkang can cut ah
must
oh ya
oh
alamak
walao eh oh the beginning of punggol lah
ya cause coney island is the other end sia
oh
ya
let's see ah wait ah
okay can lah

wow mine is louder
K can
K ready
okay let's start
ah yes
ya lah we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya lah
ya so I think what we can do we don't go uh we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual lah we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in ah
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay lah uh we can take the the voucher ah you want to buy the voucher ah meaning we have to go uh the
err
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course ah
no lah the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before what just like the night safari
the four items ah the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
err
think eleven plus ah
oh uh wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge ah seven plus to nine
two you uh ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this one right
uh we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going what you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go lah
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also lah can
the three of them
but if affaf don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two lah
then it's two two each
Subway
mm ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough lah don't know ya
have to
is the camera uh waterproof
don't have ah
can
her studies finish already what her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
err
affif I think he doesn't want to go down
eh what
twentieth right
the following week lah after christmas
can eh no cannot
yes uh uh
cannot
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have ah not open yet ah okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups lah so the kids
all the children
add up uh
it's just nice
force lah
monday
that's why first person to check is aisyah
but if you I I don't know whether
err
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
then you ask her
then if she what he say lah you ask her for her opinion and all
get the ball rolling
since
so my family side I can suggest
uh ya lah there is a few suggestion lah one is
um we split into two groups
so one group is maybe uh
ya
go to the one that is more lah kan
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there lah
so affif affaf shafie three
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
and I think they don't mind lah because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya lah
but I think if it's like just cousins
then
you have how many uh eight plus four twelve
twelve children
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
then they
K if it's a red line ah and it's too um
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
ah
amin I mean we all have been coming over
we ah mahir because the other time his family come over amin come over amin the whole family his whole family come over
okay do how ah
uh
ya lah uh we can give suggestions and then let them think
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest amin would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
uh at one time at one go
and then err
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay lah then after that
of course lah
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
ah apply
just that maybe amin uh only
the two older eh umar also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if umar is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
K so
mm
right okay so what else ah do you want to talk about um
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya lah
very difficult
ya cannot one
the night safari
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
twenty
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
or jewel
the
ya
we we also haven't gone what we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options lah so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
no
so okay lah at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that one
no the problem is
all others in singapore lah unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to what
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
um the problem with all other uh uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's uh and her lecturer one whom she took the last course kan
then she the lecturer actually say um
that
a topic module not on in these two uni lah
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
you have to write ah ah correct
so she's uh worried about the that part lah that's why
uh huh ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya lah
they actually have it leh the last time she say they the
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants ah
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
err
mm more working people are opting for that course more working people tau meaning people who are
let's say they uh they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us lah she uh or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student ah so she will be like considered as an adult already lah
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say uh
err income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
ah but actually that one not much lah
of course lah because she is ah
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
uh
ya lah
like that lah
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have uh all these other
unis ah which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
oh my god that's why I was
ya lah because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
it's very frustrating lah
ya so that one actually I thought uh I want to sit down with her and go through all the
ya lah
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
all those things lah so and she went in they were all telling her oh you know uh this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like affaf are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop uh
K so
we need another
ya we need another uh
round of her checking lah ya for her to check
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
ya lah
that's what he wants to do
so
ya lah she
lah
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based lah so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics lah right that's physics right
so more about physics
ah so you learn how to make
the uh you learn what is the because
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya lah you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
um
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application uh by this person
who wants to uh uh okay because I put up uh a post
ah resale
ya okay so two ah one is about the
um recruitment
uh I put
teacher coach uh at SAM lah
so so far
uh
two person submit one is a malay girl who
the other one is an indian lady
used to teach english
so she uh she apply but we are maths kan so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
ah that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because uh we already signed up what it's for free at that point in time lah
uh when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say uh this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
uh about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
ah
switch her lah
ya
ya lah paying the teacher only
correct lah
so okay lah so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
um a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
oh my god
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run ah let it run ah
so the partnership confirm don't want ah so I will message to say don't want ah
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya lah the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
ah
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
the worksheets for P three right ah
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue lah from there kan
okay so
progress report I told ira to do that already
ah the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
that's what you said to ira right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of ira you said to ira directly
I was there so I think it's okay lah let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out lah
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
can't be bothered to
and then we message the parents we have passed the
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
july right we're supposed to give uh first week july then we didn't give
so this one at least we give lah everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya lor
but then
buy over then he buy over lah
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
uh for uh the person who takes over is a full time
owner
tau so he was saying
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved lah
uh in
ya sort of like that lah ya correct
but I was thinking actually no lah uh yang was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut lah so I think he can
ya lah he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said lah a bit
you know I said uh uh in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot ah then I say during and all ya ya ya
uh I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only ah I can understand a bit but
uh chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say oh because
uh nearby our place uh it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so uh a lot of uh
uh
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
ah
then then uh because of that
um we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
oh okay okay but now got Google translate what
can just uh tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear lah
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say oh but the children can speak english what so the children can explain I say yes
um we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had uh chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy lah
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just oh okay
ah ah
ah that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct lah ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be uh with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
uh uh he's a graduate
ah
so he was working
uh but it was only for a few months and then COVID
last to come it first to go
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
oh okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe lah
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like oh okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better uh candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
ah so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
err do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well uh and and starts in his course lah so he was saying
he understand children uh who have difficulty in maths lah he can he can relate so he knows uh
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya lah
ya lah so no matter what at the end of the day I still need to be with them
to see how they do like what you said lah give them maybe one month to try
if good enough then we can continue if not
ya
the fit lah sometimes it's not a good fit
like sometimes some of your your method

mm
ya lah
not really
mm
oh okay
ah
I see
not really ah
so far was sam willows jer ah sam willows I I hear
and then after that
that's it lah
maybe err
sheikh haikel lah
maybe sheikh haikel music and maybe some
actually not really ah singapore band not singapore don't have
much
the malay group
ya
overseas the jam lah but those those err there's a few there's few groups those few groups that they did perform in singapore there is usually about one or two song but
not really that famous you know I have a few few friends that they they make
something along that line lah so they play at the you know the youth park
at behind orchard road there so they play at the youth park and then they
they jam one or two or three songs and then after that
that's it then that's their limelight lah
after that
most probably they just go back to their normal job lah
so they are not that famous lah
but
err but ya lah I mean
unlike those in america or maybe I don't know europe they usually they usually put the put at lot
mmhmm
ya lah the
but it was mostly malay songs lah malay songs
mm ya lah she's more more of a
like theatre
like those you know voice not not really a band kind
ya
ah fazil
nuradi is it nuradi
mm
huh who
uh not too sure
talent train ah
mm
ya
our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay lah but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
err the jokes are more for singapore centric lah not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that eh maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
mm
mmhmm
ya lah I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya and then they no lah they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya lah but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months what
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it
the talent show singapore idol
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh the voice ah sometimes like the voice lah
ya ah
ya
no lah the it's a draw what it's a draw
mm
ya lah I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again ah where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again
so then you mean what he wants to join competition every two or three years then no point also what
they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe tay is from my alma mater eh she was from yuan ching secondary
no she was way way way much my senior lah but
it's like the school very proud of her lah
yes of course
yuan ching
she wouldn't err declare
err she you know fanfare ah because yuan ching is not really that you know famous school unless you know she's from raffles junior college or what ah then then she'll flaunt it
yuan ching
yuan ching ya
I wanted to go but you you don't
amin
but now COVID don't have already lah
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already lah
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no lah most of them are retired already
I think somebody which
he's a bit a bit bald
eh ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression lah I mean
they they have to retire what once they they hit their sixties
have the energy lah
professorship
ya lah I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
yes
yes I'm millennial ah
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch lah
ah
ah ah
even my brother is millennial
my brother naz
so naz is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation lah
no she she got uh she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot lah but
but if she can if she can you know err ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya lah but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation lah I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made err
make a profit lah but the thing is if she
ya lah about one point one million lah but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
mm
how much she bought it
but her one is at simei right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand uh
thirteen years ago
mm
oh
oh okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand lah
huh
so just just
uh amber road
ah
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal lah because err
oh so new lah
well that's a risk
development
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya lah
but her place second floor
what one point
oh
her main bedroom
oh cause so it's quite big lah
ya okay but
uh huh
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
dasha when she can save more money right
mmhmm
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person what
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
mm
mm ah
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more what if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored lah then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means err in the embassy one is paying for her living space eh if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
I mean now okay lah maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya lah but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury uh apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense what
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people lah
say about thousand plus ah ya maybe ah
okay
if six person ya lah if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya lah make sense lah
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy lah one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy err is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya lah I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo lah so that
they are being sheltered lah
fixed condo
ah
ah
ya lah ya lah
mm mm ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they uh being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but err when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference ah cause
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes err what drives what drives people
mm
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
err flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
mmhmm
how much
ya that's quite a lot
oh eh so he's the degree lah
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
uh huh
oh okay
mmhmm
okay
uh huh
eton what's a eton
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore lah
oh
depend on the area lah depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese leh
he's err he knows err he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese err they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area lah maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence ah
mm
huh russia
but is it recognized or not in singapore
uh huh
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
oh malaysian malaysia hospital lah
oh okay and then then okay lah
ah
oh why ah
wasted kan
medicine also medicine what
oh
oh okay
eh oh err rundy rundy
rundy rundy
uh ireland or scotland ah
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand ah
four hundred thousand
mm
ya
mm
ya most I suggest
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait ah can remain thirteen fourteen
most of my friends
in singapore
mm
I think the highest I heard is jer lah
so not not easy
but in in in
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback ah
uh
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge ah
uh huh
ah ah
uh huh
I think ya lah because the the guys are not
no no the the
err secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
for the girls they
they're they're
ah because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which ah no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences ah
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan
cairo
al-azhar lah
then
mmhmm
oh really
okay then
okay
how come it's like that ah
okay then how about
oh
if it's not recognize then because she she don't want to take
and then the the mother wants her to take right
but now after COVID after COVID she
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's actually quite
quite sad lah
cause the amount because there's some
ya I mean that's quite
unfair lah but
the amount of effort and they put
but in the end err she should've finish already right
uh why no good
egyptian arab spring arab
ya lah I mean
mm but
it's kind of sad lah that that wani that control all those things and then
let's say if if she's not recognise cannot get a good salary job then it's also quite
quite a pity lah but luckily the sister did land with parkway east which is quite good lah that you know

there there will be a tattoo of a
ya the the the japanese wave shit then after that it's always like a koi fish going up and then after that the koi fish is at the forearm
seriously I
why do you think I saved up money for three years when I wanted to get tattoo

ah cause
because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast lah
ya
I almost got a tattoo there
no I was planning it
and then after that just when we were there he
so and then
so I was like fuck it ah like

it's just
me
like I
ya I mean
one time I literally passed out
on the living room
yeah
I don't know ah
I I know at one point she she she didn't
yeah
ya never again though
yes
throwing up
no
yeah
ya
ya I did it was like one of the first few conversations we had
cause she asked about halal haram ratio
then I said oh ya I I I used to drink a lot and stuff
ya
cause she said
ya uh I stopped already so okay lah that doesn't bother her
that kind of thing like that
ah
what
ya then happened like three
in the same night
and then after that
no I don't I don't remember
ya
that as
ya and then one time
then after that
then after that you know like they dance very close one
then my friends were behind me then they were like egging me on
that one I remember
I I was so angry at myself sia
ya
I mean I feel kind of bad but
also kind of
good
ya
how is it how was your last duty you get into trouble or not
surprising
uh huh
mmhmm
ah
ah okay
action sia
I
oh
ah
hand over shift
reservist
actually not really lah I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
mm
mm
night shift I wasn't like that ah because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning kan
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning kan
ya
last time my rota quite bonded ah
ah that's like fucking eight bicycle sia
mm
oh ya how was it cardiac arrest right
ah
cannot sia
mm
dah expect ah
mm
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
ah
mm depends ah depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
oh
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
oh
why sia
ya ya ya
all medics
my time it was like optional
they expect you to go
mm
ah
that's cool
the this captain from
err division yishun
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
so ya
oh ya my last
you know my err last duty
eh no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
then they but the I think it's because
ya it's like
pretty much lah but most of the time we still try ah just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare ah unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing lah
to do that kind
ya
then he was like like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay what actually last time medic
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
ah
ya
err they started right after I
as in
ya that's true
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya

orh they want to put people into the
ah
eh but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is ah high intensity
ya let me google ah high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol

eight eight people do

eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance to resuscitate a patient
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
make it better

eh but ons
oh
sian hopefully your next cycle gets better
what the fuck
workload and the
uh huh

ah like I never
last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download
then after that I think it was during like our talk or something like that
sir I off duty for what want to go collapse then we were like sia lah I mean I know everyone was thinking it ah but you don't have to say it bro
ya
mm
ya you download already ah
the my responder app

certification
then it's like it only last two years
ya
they said we supposed to get the card also
to say that we are actually certified
ya

like our our depth of compression the rate of compression that kind of thing

and then after that
then twelve O'clock like one of my friends booked like
they got like some viewing or some shit
and then
one thirty
I need to go send amira for her flu vaccination
chao keng pe
uh huh
mm
wah then how the hell you survive your sia
weren't you in the sun every day in bunker gear
oh

currently I haven't get my letter lah but
um
err
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me lah over good looks but
err
if I had to pick one then
how about you
err
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body lah but for good looks err if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it what so it's all down to genetics
err
err to fit body
err hopefully lah can you know live a healthier life and err not have any like
err
wah your question so deep
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
ya
so
but if you look at other countries um a bit more difficult to control lah especially if the country is very big right and
err maybe they are more how to say like social like
could be a reason lah if let's say like scientists err cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
how about you what you think
you know from all this err
hunger and starvation maybe like
err people will like the population will eventually get reduced lah cause
um
if if this I mean don't know lah maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa lah of course other countries also you see the
mm ya ya
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
oh
mm err
I mean
better like not say change myself lah but like err how to say like relate to them and like
err whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly lah
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level lah
then maybe another skill would be like
err
like the kind err it comes together with like
err performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like um
err that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence lah I mean is err it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
err then
it's it's good lah in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
is more towards um
like
err
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just err accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said lah in the condition given is that
so like
err
increase my wealth from there lah whenever the stock market go up I can just err sell it if not I just hold on to it lah until the value is a good time to sell lah
ya
ya
for me ah probably
ability to teleport lah
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time lah like
even then like
is is not a problem lah you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower lah I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like err maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing lah that
err would would benefit like
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
err
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say lah with great power comes great responsibility kan so like
um
um
I feel like it's beneficial lah because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
this err insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
mm
I mean
err I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
but
like
err whatever the case lah basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest err performance lah
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
they all look up to me as this err strong fit buff guy then
um
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
these so called good label can be um
will come after you lah because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
is down lah like
ya
so when you go into the spiral then um
err just lay down in bed just like
like
um this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look ah like good like physical look
all err
they just err placed on me lah ya
okay lah
that's one but
um of course devote some portion of day to the person lah like
err partner
like
so
I mean
my my day will most likely be like
err going to work and all that then like
err I I still like to keep fit lah as I grow older so um
if possible
err
ideally if I can become like a private sports therapist then physiotherapist then I can help
err athletes who
who like because I was I'm now an athlete like
to help all all these athletes and ensure that they are able to perform at their
when it's fully recovered you can perform better you can push yourself or
it's a it's a thing lah I feel like
err
very very important to you know err commit yourself to the other person
of course it will include cost lah but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person lah so that would be that would be ideal for me lah ya
err ya then
I feel lah that would be ideal for me lah because it's something I really enjoy and it
err
ya
but
err more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine lah ya anyway like
like
your muscle will build up but
err
especially if it's like a a decently long ride lah
it takes time lah so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in err
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
err girlfriend lah ya

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
oh have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction lah television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
uh the other twin his ukrainian
um she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised uh she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress uh tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
um uh who is one of the clones lah
then she always uh live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming uh compared to season two and season four
mm I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones uh usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this lah
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember lah because this is the current show I'm watching now
um
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it lah so you won't get err you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil lah because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended uh without spoiling it for you
err I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes uh actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's uh probably safe to check out ah because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
oh okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout lah
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse uh them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like uh draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you lah I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your uh interview outfit
um don't need tie ah I guess err maybe just a formal wear including uh smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive uh and also be open lah
a'ah
mm
okay
oh I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's ah creepier and more real it's um it's not is not a comedy like orange orange kan orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent ah ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for uh uh why you like
oh um I mean for me err I'm waiting for money heist uh wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons ah
ya ah ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya uh my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show uh I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
oh ya
mm
ya ya
oh so you think you like a professional critic ah
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about uh about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident uh raquel losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real lah if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season uh but it was very entertaining to me ah also quite compelling and way better in spanish um ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
uh uh the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this uh money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions ah but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated lah anyway so today is twelve twelve uh sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full uh a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
mm I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at uh ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of uh sneakers on sale
mm
I am looking for air fryer
uh
no I'm busy mm I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding ah strider balance bike for azam
second
uh carousell so I found one uh uh that can deal at buangkok but uh he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
oh okay lah why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay lah firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand uh second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but uh the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly lah
it depends on his father's uh interests and free time
ya so have you thought about azri's suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
uh if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in uh government sector uniform group like uh prison service uh um I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive eh but you need to read more lah you need to do more research uh but there's bond lah I think err since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this uh uniform group then you should uh still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself ah that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
uh I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya mm
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
oh so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
uh their degree are sponsored by the company ah ya I mean like for example um
mm
so rolls royce pay for his degree
oh that's good so uh as he get as he ah got the degree right so did his salary also uh goes up went up
oh okay that's good can I ask what is his position
oh okay five years eh mm so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his uh recommendation do you don't you want to work there
oh okay okay
mm interesting rolls royce okay
oh so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him lah you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so wah when he joined what was his uh education uh certificate diploma so so he join uh it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant uh then he gets to stay there with his family
mm ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house lah well that's good that's good so so he so he's uh he told you that he signed bond for five years with uh
five years okay so uh is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree oh okay I think uh singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face ah
oh it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but ah but who will pay for this uh school the company or the company will reimburse
oh that's good
if you have to stay until the company
mm that means err work and study ah ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
oh really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good um
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so err for a wait
when when did when did I said err when err I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then um
then after that there's no use for me ya okay then how about your friend that is connected to him
okay
okay what degree you want
mm so what she working as now oh searching
almost a year so until now no job
oh okay so did she graduate from or
okay okay I see then maybe you can just wait for this mark guy cause normally they will take a week so one week has pass right ya so uh maybe monday can email him just to ask what's the status then uh then can just move on lah
anyway
so uh what's the status about your bike
uh the so when is it going to change the
uh cover set what's the plan
yes
okay so meaning still need to do something to the bike so this time is engine not the exhaust okay both so the mechanic still in process me ah in a way he grew there
okay very good
uh okay um good to hear ah hopefully it will not extend beyond january
okay why to bring the bike to go where
fireworks ya so um
what's the plan for you and your hundred dollar voucher actually
so
okay ya ya they have to queue for more than four hours at uh orchard hotel
where you know about this
oh okay okay someone like review
what hotel is that do you know
oh okay concord um it's quite old anyway um so about this uh we were talking about your job right so you're you graduated with uh diploma in engineering correct engineering informatics so pretty much is engineering lah okay like azri's job
uh like ah azri's job um that one is more to or engineering
mostly it's engineering electrical rovers
okay
oh assistant engineer ah
mmhmm
oh is it
your friend
ya
uh any particular companies that you are eyeing for
tivo ya
okay so do you know if they are hiring
maybe you just get the email then can just drop her an email if it's the same person lah
mm okay okay then um
so that means you just mentioned just now uh how about okay it also open right
so is that something that you can see yourself doing oh okay okay
okay okay okay so depends on what is it lah ya also not choosy right for now okay that's good then so for uniform group okay that's good okay um okay let's see
err then how about those kind of factories that need like uh uh engineer assistant engineer like seagate far my my or my friend would just be our house and his is just five minutes away from ah so that's okay also ya
so that's okay also

ah
um as for me err
well you know like previously if you I I mean I I prefer to go out and and such but now that kind so I feel that err I've learnt to you know last time I don't appreciate um netflix or watching movies but now I learn to
um you know adapt myself to try to watch netflix or you know play games and all these kind of new hobbies activities that makes me feel like maybe closer at home ya which is very
err depends because they now play like some err netflix original you know like all the chick flicks so I'm and then some of them are horror I'm into horror also so ya

for the seats
oh okay
okay interesting
okay
so um ya
mm what
is one thing that err can I ask err what is one thing that err really will make you feel annoyed like you what do you
ya
consider okay okay ya ya totally ya
okay
err ya of course I prefer err advanced planning so I don't like it when um err for me that that is also one thing that annoys me ya
err but it's okay to me things happen I'll try to be more understanding ya but the real thing that will make me feel um annoyed is when
err actually someone lied to me you know like um behind my back it's just really annoying
so um ya
err that's one thing that will make me
really angry
ya
yes
ya
okay
grow a lot older now we just err communicate through err
ah and then keep updates lah but then the the one that err I still err hang out with the most will be my secondary school friends also currently ya
how about yourself like are you still

my personality and my face okay but good err ya good guess good guess ya you are right ya um I'm into indo like indie music ya currently that's err
um over and over again especially during work working time or working hours or when I'm about to go to sleep that's the best time for me to listen to music ya ya
okay
ya I can see that okay
emotional so you can express your feelings through music
ya okay ya true
actually
orh okay not that gore loud kind of thing lah okay okay
oh okay
okay
orh okay
right okay okay
I I saw somewhere
small service
oh
uh huh
oh okay
ah
okay
mm
okay
three months okay oh right
oh right okay
mm
mm okay okay
mm
communication there's like barrier like language barrier
okay
okay
mm ya
the communications and liaise
I see
oh okay
mm okay
wah actually uh time management
okay I
mm
you know like start err and plan is is kind of like difficult for me and to to to do a you know like trial
ya
ya
yes ya
ya right
ya and and
ya
yes ya so uh I mean twenty twenty eh to be honest has been such a tough err year for most of us like there's a lot of challenges but um this year is like um very interesting like something new for everyone so I'm just wondering about how next year
things will be like
ya
will that be your destination to your honeymoon consider lah okay
mm
okay
oh okay
okay
okay ya
ya new zealand new zealand
ya
cause I see like err
atmosphere so it it's nice you know ya can can consider for honeymoon
right
mm
okay
mm
oh okay so
correct
err I would love to err try out like the different kinds of
like um food but not I can see that my for my parents case they they are not open to try something new
our tastes ya
correct
ya
ya
you know she might not like it and she'll object to the place like for example I want to
ya so it's all
depends
correct
ya
okay previously kan err I was studying overseas kan so err it was such a
still prefer to um to the winter season
how about you do you like autumn spring spring
ya ya it's it's like
oh okay
ya
autumn okay
what's the point of you wearing in singapore but that's the only time you get to um
ya
next few trips ya hopefully hopefully
oh okay
ya
mm
okay
oh ya
okay
have you tried
bullet train okay okay
I see
but ya
but it's okay um
so maybe you can bring me you can be my tour guide tour guide
okay
but okay um
uh does it feel does it feel like do you feel like it's like an interview
I think I'm too used to err having formal conversation so it sounds like an interview to you sorry
err
secondly is the fear of height I I am not afraid to ride a roller coaster but then what makes me scared of it is like because it's quite high and then
um ya I just
ya I can still look through the window I still ya
okay
okay
mm ya
a new experience and I thought that I wouldn't be afraid or I won't like you know
err you know I won't be scared of it but apparently uh ya I was having a hard time so I didn't look down so I was like looking in front but
but how about um
I mean for you I mean what is your what do you fear actually
really you look you look like so manly
really
mm
a bee stung ah
oh okay
ah okay
sponge then you touch it is it
then
oh
did you shout
can you can you try to err you know like reenact I would love to see your expression
oh okay
went away ya
I I don't know the the name of the spider
hairy next so what kind of
ya ya ya oh no
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
mm
ya
so um
ya
carry err
okay okay
okay
you tried
oh
huh in thailand
okay
mmhmm
cocoon
okay mm
because err some people always say that okay obviously um the
err obviously is like um the the the insects that is sold um for you to like can be consumed they say that it's err clean but you know it's clean um
but I still find disgusting even though like um they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to um to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
err you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
orh
ya
ya ya ya
oh ya maybe probably ya but um
very interesting to see like uh maybe you you know err like like even when um when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
err is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a um they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them kan the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically um I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get um halal food because mostly err they eat like
yup okay
so I mean err
this is this is very interesting you know ya you know one thing that um I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have err been jumping a lot of topics but it actually err
you know connects us our conversation to to speak err
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we um when we we we talk is always on err whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can err do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
um
any any other questions that you want ask me
because I know you are a very curious person kan so probably you might want to ask
oh so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it oh it isn't the latest lah the latest kan is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay err ya I mean err it's very expensive compared ya

my side recording
five four three two one
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these leh I don't think this err all the researchers I think it's okay lah to all these to talk about all these things ah I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
a'ah
mm
mm
mm
uh uh god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks err assuming one game a week lah
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per ah for the whole tournament kan then we take just ten percent that's uh between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour lah outside lah now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out lah but whatever it is at least eh the whole tournament um one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
uh I drop it in discord
ya so
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
um I just didn't know
you know the this league not worth it seriously
ah
ah
en
mm
ya
ah
mm
mm
a'ah
a'ah
ah ah
mm
mmhmm
ah exactly exactly ya
mm
ah
ah
mm
mm
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point lah is that social media aspect lah so
but um the social media aspect of a one off thing eh
err
ah ya
ya
ah
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and ah we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio eh how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not ah
mm mm
hmm hmm hmm maybe maybe who knows maybe
mm
mm mm
mm
I
ah okay all the tournaments then
you know so
ya so
mm
mmhmm
mm
err five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know err so err or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that ah we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool eh wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off tau this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
mm
mm
ya correct
uh huh
ya okay
uh huh
ya
mm
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say eh we do everything for every
let's say every saturday lah eh every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get err thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have um four four prize winners
each of the prize winners err okay and then at least err total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright um
or we could just put it every every week err the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number lah K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
okay a'ah and then like this ah we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool lah basically lah alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say eh thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
ya
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that lah so let me get up my word pad my notepad ah so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
oh six eight
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually ah we can't do that maybe top eight ah top eight get five percent lah
yes
ah
ya get a wise five uh eh
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
uh huh
a'ah
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent ah
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great lah okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
K
um
ya
eh of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is lah whatever amount
there will really get people to like eh siala if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at eh I only pay five dollar registration fee tau I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
a'ah correct
so that's it we need to have at least
um
um
okay but that's why okay you um then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
mm mm
mm true also true also difficult ah
mm
sixty four possible
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
en
mm
so this idea eh is basically if I were to go to N
en
err but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them kan they're all out for it
his words lah
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
let me
ah
let me try and see if I can find err
err what's that called lah
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
err basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations ah
it's a it's a carbon copy
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then err this err will have err the our
what I'm afraid of eh is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about lah like
err like um even when I I told her the idea look ah why not err we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these tau she want us to be on our own
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event tau
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african lah
that's the number one thing ah
yes
ah
ah
mm
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor lah
a
ah
ah
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible um you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all lah you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
err potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
um
ya ya correct
a
uh huh
a
you will have your own you know shout out lah you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising ah a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events eh is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they err how to say that the
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer lah in a way lah
it's the same as advertisement ah so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
mm but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head eh I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay err so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us lah okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
mm
yup mm mm mm
so
ha ha
a'ah sia
alamak
alamak
okay
okay
ya
okay
um
there's another
ah correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports lah
one play E sports
pure err pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
mm
ya the singapore premier league a week ago err three point eight K views
mm
err what's that called
okay E singa cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
err E singa cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs ah
for the one V one E singa cup
one V one E singa cup
oh they split it into
the whole league
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands ah early thousands
you know so ya
oh shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
ah
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel err you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
ya that would that would really help
because eh if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just err aiman giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then err what's that called ah ya and then like this ah people will be alerted
ya
exactly
ah correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because ah I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
ah
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
a
ya
um
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
you know and all we want eh it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
or whatever we can uh we can get lah we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
ah ya so
mm
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who sekaiichi is ah they just look at pure viewership numbers ah we can talk about them eh we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
ah
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because um and you know really likes to work together with me lah basically lah
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA lah so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there lah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm ah
okay so
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
who do they have

uh um
um
uh
um
err ya then err
ah ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
oh yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get um
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad err cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it um ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
uh any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but um
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back uh just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it um even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but um maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me err excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not um just buy err knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya err just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that um which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work um then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes ah okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then uh you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say err when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss johor so much our old house ya but now it's um make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it ah abu
oh it's a terrace oh okay
yup because ah it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and err I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun lah ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase abu
sticky sambal I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's uh it's whatever happens um
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
um because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper what I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger ramly burger ramly that I miss the most yup and the abalone
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of err cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup err sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go johor and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that abu
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
mm I think so
um ah we went to cycling um
ah we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge err you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
ah and we tried um tried their ah that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it uh you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say abu like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
um yes because I was um for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
um I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
oh wait I can't um
oh actually I think I didn't went um
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or uh high elements in um school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay um my camp was at the pulau ubin there ya
um I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the uh I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore um ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to um rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
um you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
um I remember um
I can't um in secondary school we did a lot of things
um like uh like camps mostly camps
err give I remember um chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days uh and then what else oh err it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time uh in our secondary school um we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
um cause we had we change our principal I um our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they uh do uh about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
um ya
and all of them all of these charities err will be donated to the uh respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs lah for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that uh you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy err to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games ah and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you err I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
uh plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
mm ya and we have a lot of programmes lah actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme um like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed um how the way how they speak
we and their english ah the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that um I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup err from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them lah ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type lah actually um but ah for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you err like example for me uh I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
err
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like um ya um
it's like school also but no ah I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
um
sports there's a lot ah actually ya and yup oh to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves lah like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
um doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my err using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school uh we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs lah like you have to make err you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically err and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking um
because I I cause why I choose that course is um I I I want to learn how to uh bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
um pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun lah to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
oh um okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot um okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made um I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great um
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made err the pizza it um and we also make cakes um black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could err redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if ah even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like uh you have to cut it into threes uh three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and err after err the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling err at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
oh okay I remember um we didn't make okay err I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is pate choux in french and then you know uh we had to do eclaire choux so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like uh cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my err my class advisor though
um my sir showed us uh a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who uh they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed lah like they have really nice talents to um which I can also learn from them
ya
oh my lecturer name my err we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really err sir jeremy is a very nice uh teacher he
the uh he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our uh parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him uh he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who err
which teacher doesn't want to see their children uh their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like err like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
um
do you mean during COVID nineteen
um I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
um this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows err appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does uh when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause uh because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example lah like um
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross lah
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know err in restaurants last time was like uh you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the um the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like um um
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
um I know wearing a mask it will it will helps um to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face lah example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to um get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen uh to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like um it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
um
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like oh ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and oh and I was oh I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya mm but it's hard to breathe sometimes and ah ya
mm I don't know lah like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya
um so abu um
so how ah I heard that you went on on a holiday I mean you went on a staycation with your friend

like you don't discover much about singapore but actually there are so there's a lot of interesting interesting things to do in singapore ya like I went to singapore flyer before
and then see the national day parade and
discovery centre science centre the esplanade olive twice ya remember abu you went um you went to perform your choir performance at the esplanade
I think you already did a amazing job and it was very adorable to see my own brother um you know doing choir you know ya how was your experience

where was where where uh when did you when did you like uh were you chosen to go to hong-kong or what is this a overseas journey
oh oh geography students and you went to hong-kong that was cool I didn't get a chance to go to hong-kong I mean I'm a geography student but we didn't have like a programme for ya
oh pure geog
oh I see
what's the difference between normal geog and pure geog
it's like it's like it's like err O level it's like normal maths and O level maths
oh so
oh what do you okay so what do you I know okay tell me what you learned about geography or what can you tell about geography like what what what do you learn about geography
oh but oh you can understand what you learnt in geography
really
I see
yes
oh I see

okay I start
year two marine engineering
how is it going
so for me and
how about you
okay
and I'm doing quite okay in it lah
mm
doing okay
oh
is like to win lah is like to
is like not to impress the audience but to do it for yourself lah
so actually our poly life quite stale
so really boring nowadays
so how's your secondary school life
introvert ah
studying
in secondary school especially in my
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
that's when N levels I did well
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong ah
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
oh
oh
oh
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head lah I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
ya
ya
they love it too much lah they think you can they can
you can hold on to you ah
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
burger king
mm
I basically after N levels
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
I work there and it was a good experience lah it was a good two months
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
don't have the same uh mentality as us
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
so it's a tough time ah for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
ya
after staff day nope
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's what
the group mah
mm
okay that was that was fast
like photographer ah
oh
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
how to say eh
my opinion ah
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
you apply yourself
they would expect you to know how to do and all
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
because it's the top few ah from what I know lah from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
so I just follow the flow
then ya lah I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
mm
to make it as your career
mm
correct agree
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore lah
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan ah
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down lah
ya
yup but honestly
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
that's how much I love bio last time
so is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
annoying
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
mm
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun lah I mean
I I watch a lot of ah boys to men ah so I find the navy part the best ah
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
got highly likely lah
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I pass my
then after that I hope I can go to ah
special operations command
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and uh
ah firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life hor
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first leh
will definitely be will definitely glow up lah after
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
I don't think got chance ah
intelligence
talk eh
four hours
quick maths ah
okay
it was okay
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma lah there's normally
consider
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
okay
it's kinda cool though
mm
primary school
mm
is like our one of our longest ah
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be ah
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
wrestling
so I really look up to them ah
so I like their character ah
ya that was that was fun days ah
do you do parkour in school it's like normal lah primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak ah
yes
mm
mm
okay
oh
so you have been leading all the way lah you have been leading the lines lah
discipline
mm
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
tekong the left side is striker
oh
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
they were national team player ah after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
junyuan tampines located around tampines kan
junyuan
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus lah
pressure lah
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
you never go this far lah
woo amazing story
I don't really have much luck lah
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
you will always be blamed
to our highest position that we ever got
in gan eng seng secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us err err the
the the drop dead centre lah
then when I go so basically no luck lah I go delta league also I play under my school name
uh and that one second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
for a prize
then when I goes poly
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me lah it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
like
go down ah
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
um this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
they they appointed me as captain and
and I look at how rich our history
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
ya so I guess
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
you
you will not succeed
you know
at least something know
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
the change the journey lah how they get fourth how they get fourth don't celebrate the fourth because we are not there yet but celebrate how do we get there
because to see change you also have to change
we are everytime at the bottom we must think that some someday we can be as good as
we must be up there
you know
but ya lah it's all good now
then now hopefully in the future we can
do more things and improve further lah
ya so talking about how sweet you are to me
how's
like do you have any love life how's your love life
mm love life
okay
oh
like candy sia nothing serious
orh
good one good one right right
went out more often then
then who who had the courage
to go first
to ask

how do you cope with it okay
I think it's now close to an hour I purposely ask you that question so that we can end it on a high
more even though I know you already
but ya we we we open up more

that's usual lah cause ilan was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you what
timetable kan
like like she can even ask me like when I said
you have one dollar and then you buy this

eh err one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me err is it err minus or plus

he knows the basic very well

simple stuff lah
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her ah
is like
ya lah the one he didn't show us right so anyway when I read I read that
he

to me
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so
he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay

punctuation marks I don't know why
I feel like he should there should be a writing camp you know like drill them to writing and then like learn a lesson

because they cannot you cannot buy in time what it's gonna be end of the year
I don't know man
ya did he mention like
ya another two more minutes
fast
ya please please and
ilya first
just now when did err why did uh your friend calling me
mm
confidential stuff
confidential stuff
mm

eh amshar I'm doing good lah how how about you
you mean great and just
what's up ah with you and your like the whole COVID situation how has it affected you
ya like your daily life ah
ya I mean to be honest so far my
life has been as per normal because now we all have
preoccupied with things that we need to do lah like like for example
weekend is the only time I got time lah to go out and meet my friends then when we are outside also
got a lot of err measures that have been imposed ah that we need to
you eh what you notice anything different now
as compared to last time when there was no such measures
one hundred is it
hundred people ah now so but is that part of phase three or is it just phase two regulations
phase two
oh so at the end of the day still got the safe distancing measures lah
then I got wedding I need to go to lah next week then is
err from what I know they got three shifts starting from morning all the way to the afternoon
then they separate by like family and friends
people per like per time ah
so that they still adhere to all the the safe distancing measures and now also
then there's no like what intermingling lah between each of the people that are going to be there so the functional groups do not counts lah
ya I mean at end of the day this kind of things how to say this ah is like
it definitely affects how we carry things out like socially lah it goes against like social like norms
cause you go to a wedding to interact with other people and all that and but then I think given the
kind of situation
like I mean get to see each other also
I mean should be grateful lah
ya
oh no serious serious like my uncle's
err wait my uncle's sister wait that's my aunt ya my aunt is getting married
ya
okay ah
eh then that time your I remember you posted something about err
ya that one I'm not
ya
okay okay
okay
okay from what I saw there's like err a bit of a
contention here right because uh
some people say that err
or poly or something ya ya
something like that lah from that's what I understand lah but I haven't really read into it yet lah so
okay
oh
but I mean this kind of things if it's going to affect primary school then of course I think
err will also affect judging from err taking O levels and going to what tertiary education as well lah
ya
speak
ah
I think for me I think it's the same for both of us lah especially
I still need to focus on getting things done and obviously focus on going home or booking out right
ya I mean obviously I think it's quite boring now
but then I guess in the future there'd be
maybe we'll need to use what we learn in army for our own good lah ya
so I think
okay I just ask you honestly ah do you any see do you see any purpose in doing now or not ah
ya
understand understand
ya
ya
you learn life the life lessons that you learn are social lah
work with people
who are from like different different backgrounds like they all come from different areas lah
can or not
ya
like your own circle lah ya I I agree with you about that lah I think
also for me I'm having the same experience army
people outside my own social circle and
err I got to make new friends ah which is quite good also
and at end of the day I feel
that
err these two years err
how to say this not only I guess to a certain extent serve the country but also
ya lah I mean we all have our different opinions about lah but so far ya the year is going to pass soon
ya these two years will not be wasted and I'll still get to
enjoy it lah while it lasts ya
mmhmm
go to or choose to go or not to go
I'd say I think I would choose to not go lah because I feel
like err
I can err
well when I'm outside lah as in cause you think about it now I'm at my prime
eh I'm at I'm at my prime of my youth
I still go I can go out I can go help out treat my parents all that like they all am I as I think
most importantly is like my grandparents lah now is like the best time for me to after right
um you know I take a short break I go help out my grandparents for a while and all that before I start school and all that I think that will be what I want to do and learn
you know travel around the world all that but okay obviously now maybe it's the best time
to be in cause I can't really
do anything else lah ya because of the whole COVID thing I can't really travel also ya but
I think okay ah now looking back err
it's not such a bad deal lah
mm
really meh you think it will really
help us meh like cake
oh okay fair enough
yes
mm
okay okay I mean
ya I guess I uh I mean this is no brain right so
ya let's jump right of the next bed let's go err amshar what do you like to do over the weekend when you're not in
actually no let's change it now like
let's just say uh you're going out with your family
I think those kind of places really got the vibes ah ya
you really just feel like uh you're shut out from the world already then when you go outside that's when you can really spend time with your loved ones lah
ya and especially when you eat home cooked food
ya that's
ya that that's definitely a different experience lah then when you are inside camp when the meals are all provided for you
ya but for me personally I think
err free kan everyone got uh no plans so we all just go err at least have a meal lah together
and most of the time err my mum will cook and then err
we just make it a point to just sit down together at a table and eat ah
you worst comes to worst is err
how you call that we just order in food lah if everyone too tired
ya but
sometimes when there's a bit more free time or I'm blocked leave and now especially school holidays kan
so
even though err we then we will go out like
ya so
we actually we stay in the car then we just drive around singapore lah you know that kind of thing
ya it's just it's just about spending time with your loved ones lah
ya
I think for me I like to
so betweeen spending time with my family and friends because both of them are
are as equal importance to me lah
ya because friends are what uh
has made me like uh what I am today for the
how could I say ah for like the latter part of my life so far but family
ya most of the chapter of my life I'm thinking about my friends lah
but my family is the one that raised me and had been with me throughout my entire life
so I definitely owe it to them ya and I genuinely err
uh enjoy spending time with them lah ya
so it it's definitely I think a struggle cause
so the
so it's all about err that
what you call that
balance lah between err spending time with
err your family and your friends
I think definitely another thing we should talk about is the challenges
with the allowance that we get
your money how do you spend your money on amshar
ya
me ya actually
I'm quite open if we my parents so lately
ya I just share with them then they just share me you know how father lah right they talk about
cannot what it's all they will just exaggerate the stories until it becomes so extreme
and I know they consider us the strawberry generation lah having it easier than them right so
it's nice to have a conversation topic you know with you parents a very natural conversation topic
ya then I guess to a certain extent it brings them together lah like they say it's err every singaporean son's journey right so
it's something that uh helps
maybe it helps me feel closer to my parents if not my dad lah ya and my brother also
ya
I think for me I had
haven't haven't yet because it was still in january mah
so ya we all went
ya we only start just about I think a month apart so we're kind of in the same batch just the batch after yours lah
cause we're already went in batches then I remember that first day
my whole family follow me I think was me my
what
ya cause err I don't know people had extra then they just give me ah
so the five of us just went in together then
so obviously it was a western wednesday that they even there was a
what it was a tuesday I think ya or monday lah ya
and one of the worst workout days
ah first thing I went back to bunk ah I just
like wah what am I doing
far away from my family in in awhile lah doing something that
I didn't uh explicitly choose to do lah
let's just put it like that
ya
ya but then I think compared to
my batch my batch didn't exactly get the
full experience cause uh we didn't get to at
marina bay you know that whole err walk
across east coast and all that walking together then
going through all the tiredness all the fatigue together
carrying everything back I mean we
didn't manage to do that lah but because my batch was more like
we just ended up at the parade square then we just there
then we call it a day then we went home
although we lost that bit of it I think
since my batch was longer I got really close to my
friends lah and some of them they had followed me all the way to my new unit also which is
quite good lah then we'd be even closer ya
ah the most recent batch they did twenty four
err oh changi food food center right east coast east coast food center ya
but
I mean it's all about that um
encouragement and that feeling of like you know you are finally finishing
of like that journey right so
I think is I mean they give it to you all lah ah you finished
ya that nine weeks of then you just
I mean you feel good about yourself lah
like before you go into your unit or your next phase of training ah
ya
yes
I mean it's not for everyone lah bro
oh ya ya that's true
mm
okay
okay
mm
okay I think this kind of thing is like at first I was also wondering why then that's when I really started to
I spend my money on lah so you know the money that I get I just
it's already like this much
then it's like I feel like ya it's easier what I mean taking is cheaper
but time is definitely of the essence in this case cause I always want to
what book out early book in late ah ya so
what
oh the the amount of money I spend on
transport err food
and then after that err miscellaneous stuff they are like things that you just have to spend money on let's just say
err
going to like gift shop or the emart
to buy army supplies so these kind of things
it gets err what you call that you don't really think about it lah
at first glance then there comes the
other things that you don't need but you want lah
so that's when you really need to be more
mm
mm
honestly correct correct um ah
mmhmm
ya lah
slightly more lah ya you don't save
ya
but I think it's the this time is the perfect like opportunity for you to
you're really getting um
that taste of financial freedom
especially on your on your own right so you really can decide what you want to do with your money
ya sometimes ah I understand
like what you said lah like when I first got it also I was like wah I'm actually finally getting money then I end up
all the useless useless things that I don't really need
but then I want to buy cause I
finally have the
capability to buy them you know
ya then that's when I
err I started like really writing down everything cause I was wondering
where all my money went
ya then then then you realize err actually
there's a lot more that you can do with your money and one thing that
people are doing now is that they're really making their money work for them lah
come on especially right so with all the investing and all that
ya which
which I'm not so sure how it works I'm going to be honest but
ya I think everyone is just putting their money in it then they're waiting for the results now lah
because it will determine whether they earn money or lose money lah
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya I think I mean
I understand lah maybe this generation is
the the mindset is a lot more different I guess certain extend it's like it's more towards like
err a lot a lot more people from our generation are thinking ahead
as as compared to err trying spending their money lah feeling that
I mean trying to err not to say like enjoy now lah
but err saving the money for retirement per se
that kind of thing or for their further studies and all that
I feel that
more of us are more aware of what our
our future is like
you know and what how much we need
for our for us to like live a better life in the future lah ya so that we can always err
like help our family out lah or
at at the least like help ourselves out and not be a burden to others lah
ya so more of us are becoming more financially aware
and more
and hopefully financially stable lah
ya
mmhmm
four lah four
ya okay
mm ya
ya lah ah ya I understand where you come from lah
ah ya
mm
I think for for our generation it is like
ah no as in from what I've seen they're still
I think some people are from especially my seniors lah
since they're all what you call that ah
cause you know that that err we have that break routine um
when once you then the start school then they go overseas all that spend all their money right
then when you start uni then you really feel the crunch but you
don't have enough money lah for yourself
ya then
because of that you don't really get to
err fully enjoy your your life I guess
because you think about it let's just say you
spend all your money in one shot you don't get to spend it like
err throughout
I mean throughout your university before you actually like
get like a stable job lah
ya and I guess the purpose of
really like gives you that a bit of a headstart for you to have err financial independence ah
and um do what you want with it lah
mmhmm
uh huh yes
ya
ya
what was my plan right for investing I think for me it's not so much about um investing but
uh what uh I want to do is that
I guess it for the next year I will try to get a scholarship lah that's something I would like to work towards to lah
spending I'd definitely want to do it myself
and for the uni fees all that I really
how to say ah they like what you've said they've been supporting you whole life like maybe it's time you really take things into your own hands ah
ya and really just err be more
independent ya
but then if that doesn't work out whoa
maybe I might even consider signing on lah
cause okay if you think about it it's a
it's uh realistic it's realistic it's worth especially um
err you don't spend money as much
definitely because food okay realistically food is provided for by the cook house
okay I won't say it's amazing
ya it's acceptable lah ya and it's like
basically food outside is nicer but I mean I can't complain what
right so ya and then you the more time you spend inside
you don't spend so much money outside and then because of that you can save more
and because you can save more you can do more money with your money outside
right then
I guess by extending our contract you already give yourself a headstart of going into like
a tertiary education ah or in my case I guess uni lah so
by doing that really
um provides me with an excess of cash that
allows me to
okay so where were we ah
I think was about being like um financially independent and
being able to spend your money the way you want to but at least
ya I think that's what more things are
are things people my age are noticing becoming more
err responsible in that particular aspect of their live lah
which I think is definitely a good step ahead
if you think about it lah because everyone is um
how to say it's not about
mm not wanting to accept help from your parents but it's about wanting to really
being able to err
take your ah carry your own weight ya and really err feel the sense of um
what you call that of that reality you know that your parents have might should have led you from lah over these past few years lah
ya definitely lah
can we talk about food now amshar please
okay
ya I don't know how we ended up talking about and all
ya eh so amshar ah what's your favourite food
huh
ya
I think what's your favourite food
ya
the what
oh oh scone scone
ya
of course halal most important bro
ya
I think for me it's not about
having a favourite food but because eat I don't know I feel like eating for me is always a reason for me to socialize
no ah like it's something that helps me
people around me that I know
and I talk to so
eating is more of a social thing to me rather than
being um
ya for the taste of it lah and
that's why when I eat I don't necessarily
have any err preference of what I want to eat I just only generally ask what people like to eat then I just go eat there
ya so
for me if you ask me what's my favourite food I like comfort food lah
comfort food
hajjah maimunah bro hajjah maimunah expensive bro
okay
is booming is booming
no that's not even
then I remember bought um
eight dollars for one head
wah that was like ridiculous man
so
okay the business is booming
definitely because there are people that love that kind of food
and obviously I like it lah ya but you cannot eat it too much and too often
ya
bro it doesn't help that the food is like delicious
ya
a'ah
okay lah okay so we're talking wait ah so I was as I was saying right so let's just say
but if you ask me about my favorite food right I know I feel like
a strong inclination towards ban mian
ban mian
soup is like really something that wah I feel like ah tom yum also but tom yum is definitely maggi for me bro
ya like if I eat tom yum right the maggi one it just hits different lah I think
would definitely be instant noodles
then it's also quite easy to make lah then like that I also don't have to what
err wake up the whole family to cook right
so I just cook on my own and then just and then it's a sharing thing also
so you don't always don't just cook maggi one person
let's cook maggi for more
cause your ya
like then
it goes back to a social thing
ya I mean it's like food is not just about
err for sustenance per se but it's all about um
looking out for others also
no then I guess that's what can really bring people together also lah
ya
okay lah
just feel that just taste of food in your mouth ah
oh swimming lessons ya ya ya I remember that time
oh ya we'll stand outside the the convenience shop and then we just
wah I think now is like really the best lah
wah is that wah then the keep brings back memories so like
like what you said lah I think it's a it's a
is in
ya
back then we ate a lot less ya
oh bulking season bro
ya
ya
oh ya
I think eh two I remember when
ya when when I was studying for A levels right I don't my I don't know cause when I was in J one
my weight was sixty five kilo
ya it's like I went up by about fifteen or so in like a year
because I was just stressed out from studying A levels lah and food was something that gave me comfort lah
ya cause okay cause you think about it right you can't
so right
so cause the moment I'm eating means I'm not studying
correct so I'll I'll just eat like I'll eat a lot so like
feeling lah ah ya lah so
that that that the break time right was really very precious lah
so obviously you try to extend it as much as possible because of that I ate so much
then I just well just studying eating studying eating studying eating then what it said it was eating
not say purely for sustenance ah but so you don't feel so bored
cause the moment you're studying err the moment you're eating you are taking a break from all your books all that
then you get you that is quite boring lah
ya so I feel like
that time was a
it was a good time that I just ate the same type of food everyday
that's ridiculously unhealthy
ya but I didn't mind it
mmhmm
then after that go back to study again
ya it's it's like the same cycle everyday
mm
mm
ya but I I I think I
for me personally I cannot forget the school canteen food yet
the what I remember cause cause coming from our school was like
um what you call that there's very remember there's only what two halal stalls is it
there was only two halal stalls so the options for the muslim students were not really that much also lah
ya so it's like
ah they had they had the only they for the roti prata which is like not even allowed
oh so fucker level and the food was so good
ya
ya then we'll buy that was a definitely a secret menu item
then when people started looking eh bro what's this ah what's this then after that
then we all start everyone started ordering and then there was this err
it was like wah really if I go eat there again that would definitely bring back memories ah
ya
and
that's that's that's that's the thing lah because
food was
what like bond us together cause the only time we met each other right definitely was at the canteen
ya and there's only reason one reason you're at the canteen it's either you're skipping lectures or you're eating something
and most of more often than not we'll be eating something
ya I mean if you're awake lah
that's a
prerequisite
uh
eh but speaking of food right do you cook
ya lah
ah yes
it's such a millennial thing to do to use an air fryer
you know it's really not that much healthier in my opinion it's like uh you're still cooking it in fat
but it's just it's own fat
ya okay so I guess if you ask me I mean
ya wah that was a absolute err logistic nightmare
this one can make forty then come out wah twenty five pieces only then I was like what you want me to do
obviously I it's my first time again
ya then
obviously that's terrible right so I had to make like two to three batches if I'm not wrong
um wet
then I have to oh err ask my mum eh what to do what to do then my mum also not really a baker
fair so like okay so we figured out okay alamak just add more flour lah that kind of thing so it's like it makes it more
err usable lah ya then experiment that's when
you really figure out like eh actually it's a lot more feeling than to actually
err know the exact quantities of what you need to use cause you given the humidity and all that it all the that kind of thing plays a part
temperature of your surroundings
ya you don't think about that and your recipe doesn't tell you about that also
ya
I mean ya lah ya lah
but as a new cook all these all these kind of things are definitely out of your control what
some came out nice some came out cracked then you like eh why
so I end up eating the cracked ones the nice ones I give away lah
ya so I don't know that's just quite fun lah I remember I'll go to everyone's house
then err slowly drop off one by one
and you know uh
ya I dodged his mum so I I stay in the
that trip was just for you bro
that's quite nice also lah ya
I mean because that time I remember it was
cause it was the COVID thing
no no uh
ya
and you had your interview
ya lah
ya you got your interview that's why I asked you to meet me at the then you're like
err err ya
is not bad not bad
ha wah the things I do huh for my friends
uh
no lah
ya
mmhmm
I generally just wanted to try baking it and see what you all thought of it lah
because obviously I cook what twenty five pieces of
so I might as well just give it away lah then the other thing you were saying about
you naturally you're helping people out on the street all that
that one is still that's still err like a blur for me because
the thing is um how to say this ah that time I help someone then he said that
actually she doesn't need my help
cause she has done this many times it's just that she's a bit slower
so at the end of the day right I also feel
but then err she knows the she can do it on her own so she doesn't
want to seem like she needs help lah
and obviously I want to respect her decision but at the same
same time ah you can't help but
notice that eh you're kind of holding up the queue lah so
I should probably make you go a bit faster lah
but then I um feel like I don't want feel like I'm undermining her effort
you know of trying to being independent
how ah
ya
yes eh definitely
mmhmm
ya
ya because ya I understand
ya
ya
because there she cannot reach understand understand ya
ya
I
mm
understand understand
ya
but at the end of the day they they know that they they need your help lah
ya there are certain things that they definitely cannot do and it's rather to
and they rather choose to avoid it lah but at the same time that's when you guys come in lah when you guys help out
I think like from personal experience um
you know that um
you have to be sensitive lah be more aware of this kind of things so this kind of issues you
you cannot say them out loud
definitely because it can hurt people's feelings
but it's something that you have to consider when you're about to help someone lah especially elderly person
ya oh my god how did it run out of topic
again by so far
okay then let's just
bring it back the thing it was about you talk about
eat eh helping your friends oh talk about friends right then you
ah then you talk about helping others on the street
ya
okay
oh my goodness wait where were we
ya let's just go back to food I feel like that's a good consensus okay
you know right I think in my opinion
a lot of people have this misconception that
sedap then if it was not halal
I think
ya
ya
okay definitely ya
mmhmm
hmm
okay
no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about more is like err more to being uh okay being like
the
ya in general in general ya because because the
the amount of food that we can eat right is definitely there's definitely a restriction
so in a certain sense you'll feel like eh you're
how how do I say this mm like when you go out with your group of friends
then you just see you're the only muslim guy there the only practising muslim guy there who needs to eat halal food
to a certain extent you feel like you're doing slight inconvenience
that they have to go eat at a halal restaurant I think this is a
it's a it's a it's a known thing lah huh
cause like let's just say eh err
let's go eat ah din tai fung you know obviously that's a no go for me
um make us feel bad so they will just err go to somewhere we can eat lah
and end up we go to the same place every single time
eighteen chefs bro eighteen chefs is the go to bro
ya then
at the end of the day it's like
these food options they are still there but
just that it's it's err slightly limited lah
according to what we eat and and I don't know I have to admit from what I've noticed that
um let's just say you're eating halal food obviously different cultures have
um
halal versions of their food also and a lot of people are doing that
but these tends to be more expensive
than usual
like okay then in my opinion let's just say you go uh there's a lot of cheap ramen stalls
ya lah let's just say ramen stalls but they're not halal
cheaper ramen stalls but then for the halal versions of these kind of stalls right I think a lot of prices are quite expensive and
ya because they're halal and there's definitely a demand for it
so I feel that to a certain extent this is not fair
and then when we go as a group also then wah the obviously the receipt be quite expensive lah
then it's not fair to them because there's like offers on like
other shops and all that
so it's it's more about the variety I think that's the issue here
ya but then again I don't want to restrict my friends from not eating pork you know what I mean
ya like okay I'm I'm definitely fine with you eating pork but it's like
ya it doesn't affect me it's just it's just a personal stand when I see it's like
I don't want to make them feel paiseh also
ya what you want to eat
so I guess what
they I mean they say don't mind lah but sometimes like what I've have done is that
I just go and sit somewhere there also lah but I don't eat also
ya just sit in and then you just
talk lah because at the end of the day like eh actually it goes back to the same point where
for me eating right is more of a socializing
thing rather than actually having to eat because I can eat anytime bro at home there's always food
ya there's always that ice cream container inside with
ya with no ice cream and not what you call that uh but I've no no what's that err
that's it's like ya and it's never
what the neopolitan one ah
ya eh that's definitely a piece of your childhood right there
ya okay
then I think if you like going back to that point right it's like
I don't know ah there's no solution for this it's just something I felt like talking about
take to the edit ah there certain definitely there certain places with
a higher concentration of halal food as compared to other places lah
ah like okay I meant bugis paya lebar or bugis bro
so many halal food there and but it's definitely more like cafes and all that
so it's definitely on the more expensive end
that kind of stuff ya that's the easy option
and they don't mind but I tell you I can't eat prata every single day bro
prata is not I can't live on prata bro ya
mm uh mm
ya
ya definitely
especially here especially here
yes no actually that's why I think it's a good thing that
the government is like trying to push for using more healthier ingredients and you can see this a lot in
they've err they're slightly no update okay it's very obvious
obvious and uh they're slightly cringey
err what you call that national err health promotion board ah
what you call they try to insight
healthier choice references into like certain malay jamaahs right
err coconut milk and all that right
so when you see this kind of thing it's like okay obviously they are pushing for it so that people
will like oh actually there's healthier versions of this kind of food that we can eat then you can actually eat more of it lah and
to a certain extent the taste will change a bit but for the most part it'll be the same lah
like cause it's still the same dish mah
ya and
like what I said it is definitely not obesity diabetes is definitely a big problem
like ya huh so
hmm
I think but to be honest is
I wouldn't think it's from our generation it's all the older generation mostly because
the the diet has and will always be consist of err will always comprise of
that lah of that kind of traditional food
definitely definitely you can change bro but uh you have to understand the
mindset and the
practice of someone who's err older right it's definitely something very difficult to
err change or enforce it's it's definitely it's definitely it's like
it has to come in like very slow stages lah
ya
ah yes yes yes
ah bro then when the teh O is like what three scoops of three bold scoops of sugar
eh ya understand
but they don't
ya and and I can understand where they're are going from we've been doing this our whole life why should we change
ya they're still okay and it tastes ya ya definitely I agree ya
ya ah that's why they cook the nicest food
but you definitely cannot go there and eat there every single week
they're having that's that's just too much
no we my my family makes it a point that we just bring our own food there so they don't cook
so we bring when we bring our food we tell them in advance and then we bring like healthier food lah
so the
but we only go there every week lah
that's when we are all are free mah cause if we go there that's when the whole family is together
so we can go there every weekend lah or so
ya so
ya
also
to a certain extent because okay imagine like
err this kind because like I mean uh for
so she definitely want to try new food also
then like because certain things that she cannot cook
especially like it's quite cool lah that's because she likes
to she doesn't mind eating sushi you know japanese food she doesn't mind anything
which is quite sick and this this this tends to
how do I say this I think it tends to be healthier
I mean especially like sashimi like that kind of stuff
ya I think sashimi is definitely healthier bro
it's just fish right so ya so we bring it over
mmhmm
ya lah
I mean
I think by a long shot but ya
and sashimi is not with rice so on it's own already
ya ya lah
so like going back to that is
like when we bring we come over we'll bring food right so she doesn't
it's not that she doesn't have to cook because she insists that she definitely makes family lah because
so the guests feel I mean it's something that they hold to lah quite close lah
she prepare less lah
ya so that's that's a good thing that's a good start
I mean ya but I think ya okay
straying off topic again one of the unhealthy things that I will always look for to err weekends is definitely bubble tea ah
I don't know I'm a bubble tea kind of guy man it's like
what's your stand what's your stand
ya
it's a social thing social thing again
so you're peer pressured into buying it
chocolate eh
ah
oh so oh you're more of that old school bubble tea lah so you're talking about the oreo crush that kind of ice blended drinks is it
so I mean this brings back memories bro okay actually that's the thing because last time right
and then got err sweet
I don't know man it just closed bro so
I remember it was what oreo crush will be like two dollars
in fact it was I think something it was less than two dollars then you you upsize it
huh
ya you upsize it to two fifty or three dollars
then now you wah you take a look at all the
standard bubble tea shops one cup is like three dollars lah at least
or like or student card
okay which is not legal by the way
so it's like it's still then that's when it becomes like two dollars or even one fifty something like that
ya
I mean I I think I think about it that
these kind of things is
it's something that you enjoy on the weekends lah something like you don't really have all the time so
I think it's okay cause in camp you're definitely just drinking water
some other thing
dude I think I'll be I'll go crazy
definitely ah my money you will just disappear on poverty
okay I understand extend the contract lah you mean
ya bro I haven't considered signing on bro
ya
especially you'll be in a situation where you'll be more aware of your finances
ya
okay ya lah ya lah definitely lah I mean there's still a lot of ways to fill up your time
I forgot more beneficial if before starts
is easy it's an easier role ya you know what's going on
I think like
if you
like if you about about the food thing right let's just say
even though
you spend money like buying food outside and all that at the end of the day it would be better if you end up cooking
learning how to cook on your own because it's definitely a useful skill ya it's a skill that you should have in for your life because
at some point in your life you'll definitely be living alone
right obviously you also know that
that's not very sustainable so
if you want to eat something else lah
but this kind of thing is
definitely up to you
and up to your own preference ah
but
how you how you how you feel about that
ya I agree with you

eh long time no see bro how are you bro
oh you working as a steward is it I heard last time when I saw you at facebook
wow six months eh
so uh what's your favourite country
serious ah
saudi arabia
mm
and then they have a lot of uh weapons uh
a lot of things ah so I don't really trust
spain
but how do they earn when there's no spectators cause I think that's a huge sum of money where they can get kan cause you pay then a lot of people watching the football so how they can earn their money besides the sponsors ah
wow so they really suffer eh so all industry are affected by this eh
give you all these grants give you all this money but in the end they will take it back I mean technically is like a business
but then I decided that you know uh I don't think I can last in that line
I'm more interested in the healthcare industry since ah
you know my my poly days I I took that course right healthcare and management so I thought maybe I would just venture into into this line and then if this COVID thing going on
and I have to do a lot of things admin stuff but still uh no choice ah what to do kan
ya so these things are are the same ah so at the at the first few months these swabbers they will earn a lot of money and then now I heard that they
in fact they don't ah allow any swabbers anymore cause there's too much
even the doctors are doing it by themselves so
now they are encourage people to volunteer for for to become a swabbers
but as a clinic assistant ah I can tell you it's actually pretty safe ah cause you're fully protected you're under the the uniform
mm
people who try to work as grab food deliveries eh
times are hard so they will
they would they manage to sacrifice their dignity eh
I think ah then still I mean I wouldn't say dignity ah I mean that that job is you can earn quite a lot if you know how to play the game well lah I would say
mm
bro that one I think really depends on on the family that you're living with ah if you are living with your parents and then I mean that should be fine cause all of you are working if your parents are working as well or if they don't then you have to support them but if you are living with
know children and then your wife that's pretty tough though
then both of you are working then should be okay ah
you know
ah have a lot of kids for our parents you know
mm
mm
ya that's true though
um actually depends on the expenses that you are
having then
ya but I I worry ah if in the future I mean now especially with the COVID situation
I I think err the new families are more worried to even have children
they will definitely get it back
despite the circumstance that we are in
bro mine I think around six hundred plus ah cause I have a siblings in the house kan
and if you living in a big house
a lot more family members you know
and then you use a lot of electricity or water
then if you have little you have low wages for I mean as as parents then it's really difficult lah for you to sustain
so and I think a lot of people are now hustling their way ah I mean legit especially I mean
grab food delivery riders out there you see a lot of people are trying their best working day and night
my I cannot really imagine ah but for now I I think I'm in the comfort zone so
sooner or later I think I really need to hustle ah if not if I don't have any savings for now still then in the future I'm not gonna rise ah
exactly
I think ah a lot of
things are affecting them
you know especially when it's you know you you've been quarantined inside the house
you you know some people say it's a blessing
cause you get to meet a lot of family members but err you forget to look on the other side of the coin where
if your family members are more aggressive
are more violent in a way so they are more trapped they are more stressed
and then they might hurt
the other family members ah so it's quite
quite a sad thing to hear
and then err you know
having to lose their jobs
you know all these stressful matters will definitely affect their mental health ah so that's why I think especially if you know if you have a lot of debt
so that's why I think most of them or some of them decided to kill themselves lah cause they cannot take it already what
and then so this why all these things ah need to to be considered but I think everyone is suffering in their own way so we really have to make do ah
these things this ah period will go away
we just have to stay on and pursue and not give up ah
we
suffer bro
mm
mm true ah true
I think it's only important besides you know hustling for the money you also have to take care of our health ah legit
mental health physical health also
if you only focus on your work you can get sick
so it's really hard it's we are living in a hard time so we really have to you know our priorities
and to make sure it's it is well-balanced ah ya and it's it's easy to say but
you have to make do ah with whatever we can we have to change our schedule change our lifestyle for the time being ah no choice bro this is the hard time ah then
I really hope that this thing will go away ah seriously
ya of course bro
mm
mm true true I agree ah
but ah I'm not sure if there's any difference cause right now
um with this situation going on
err people who's been living
so I think is very difficult for those who are
ah who are well-off ah as compared to those who who who has been living err
but this is their difficult times
but what you think of trump personally like do you know that the the way how he conduct the country how he see people I I heard that he's islamophobic I mean cause we are muslims kan what what do you what's your take on that
ya islamophobia
oh
cause what they are doing is is basically cruel I mean and I think the whole world is against it or most of the countries I would say even america or the united states eh the ah ya uh the whole
you know simply cause they are
they are number one in the business
and they are controlling everything
I'm not I'm not
ya it it's so sad and so sick ah to be honest
yet the other countries are not I I don't think they are putting enough effort to stop their whatever they are doing ah I think it's it's too much ah to be honest
but like like like what I've said ah I think it's cause of the power that they are holding
you know in the business ah sector that's why uh most countries do not dare to to make any actions against them ah
it's ironic ah we we study history and yet we we are doing nothing for the future to change what has happened to the past
we just repeating the same old thing you know wars
concentration camps and it's
it's it's just I don't know I don't see any change ah to be honest it's just
it's all about politics business
you know everyone wants to win a game and no one is really thinking about you know err what's ethically and morally right for everyone you know not just for the people who's in power
mm
oh that that's
that's another actually interesting uh news ah
the this black people they black people kan you know they have been living in america for so long
they have been going through a lot
you know especially with all those ah big uh big leaders last time err like muhammad ali the famous boxer and then
they still do not see
the black people as
as american which is quite
I don't know ah I don't understand what
you know it's it's it's
it's just a colour kan why the whites feel so superior about it
I mean I may I may I may sound biased lah but it's it's the fact that whenever whenever you open the twitter or facebook you see all these injustice going on and I'm not saying there's no injustice between the black community itself ah but
it's just unfair ah cause the whites are just taking over and then they are taking advantage as much as they can just cause they are white
I mean it's stupid ah
mm
perform ah
I mean you just see one george floyd but you never know in other streets in other places where how how did they treat other black people they make it they may be killed silently without us knowing
without us being seen on the video clip without being recorded
so it's really I think it's the the the police system in america is just so
screwed-up and corrupted lah in in all aspects and this is just one side of it and the world whole world goes crazy
how the black people really feels to be
to be looked down upon
to be castrated and to be really being to take advantage of ah in all aspects even in their lives their lives doesn't really matter tau so it's really sad ah
ya
err
rules applied in our countries so that we we know how to
are are very strict with these rules so if you can see in facebook or twitter
if you can see any people that get recorded for being racist
the police will come down as fast as they can and then really resolve the matter ah
but it's really but the offence is really high I heard that's why you can't be racist
too overwhelming to a extent where it's
speaking of which
it's also I think it's it's really the privileges ah eh in singapore but I think the privileges in malaysia and singapore is is different ah
ours is more like a soft privileges for the other race
and then for malaysia it's really the obvious privileges for the malays ah
but um
ya when you look at these malaysians eh they
despite all the privileges that they have especially the malays kan they they are quite complacent with
with the how
things are going on with the politics or how the government run the country
or
but I think before they I mean they I I think when they want to become the minister they had good intentions but uh
but then ya lah you know
when they are when they have the power it's again it's all about the power you know the the greed they have all these then they
their intentions changed
they changed ah in terms of controlling
and then they you know they do all these kind of bad things ah which doesn't really ah help the citizens so I think they they have lost their paths the correct paths
ya mm
eh I I actually agree seh cause ah when I when I watch ah the parliaments in malaysia eh
actually quite jialat eh like they the way they is not really ethical and it's just very chaotic inside the
the room that they are having
and then I'm pretty sure there's err a person in-charge kan to control how the situation is like when you know the arguments get escalated
or when they have their points viewed ya they want to really you know press the other people then they should really have a someone to control ah to make to make sure that the thing is in control but then
ya speaking of which err I I got saw this one video
where all the malaysia parliaments
he
he can't even in proper english which I think that should be one of the basic uh
basic err
ah basic skills to perform when you are presenting to the other people from other countries kan cause you are representing you're representing your country what
then he cannot even speak
english
simple english perhaps
it's it's it's if if if you found it the the video on youtube I think you will laugh ah which to me I find it very very ah interesting cause how can someone
err who is representing his country coming from the parliament cannot even speak proper english
how do they decide on who should be the in-charge
to take the degree for you or you fake a degree and not get caught by it
I think uh it's a lot of mysteries happening in malaysia eh you can get away with all these things
um
how the malaysians are handling their
their their their
mm
ah that's true eh I I I been to malaysia a couple of times for leisure purposes lah eh but I really like despite how I I really admire my country
and how they govern the country with the rules and the laws but I just feel that
I don't know eh I feel like if I were to live in malaysia I'll be more happier in a sense ah but speaking of I mean in regards to your question ah kan
spend more things over there as compared to singapore you can't really spend that much you have to pay the bills and everything kan so
it's not that err
ya I I probably will work in singapore and then I would live in malaysia
it takes a lot of risk I mean I would say there's a small sacrifice ah and then probably err you know
get a holiday or something to really enjoy if I really want to you know
to enjoy my holidays ah
so ah I I think there's risk if you're living in singapore or malaysia
so I mean I will see how it goes ah I really don't know how to go about this
but definitely
having to live in singapore and been to malaysia before I really think I would suit
living in malaysia ah cause I think the lifestyle there is much more peaceful and much more fun
just feel that if I were to live in malaysia I can do a lot more things
especially when you have the money ah
mm
um how you upgrade yourself lah as a person
and if you really
have a good job
and have a good career
or you can do a lot of things ah doesn't mean you have to live in malaysia to live happily
ya I think these these these things is really about I think in singapore and malaysia also about education ah or anywhere else in other countries
as long as you have good education have a good job then you will live a happier life
err ya it's tough ah but I think overall still again it's all about balance ah if you study and work hard and doesn't really care about yourself you will eventually you know don't don't live happily ah which which is not the goal that you would want to pursue I guess
serious ah
I I think it's uh I don't know how how to say this but
maybe we we we have seen the wrong side of the internet
we just see what cause if you realise
these are the people who want attention so they will post this kind of things and then we cause we live on the social media a lot so we tend to think that this is the trend but maybe
mm ya true I I think as a man we should lead
we should we should show that we are
we are the ones who are able to provide
and then not the ones who
to to seek help to I mean I'm I'm not saying in the sense that we we all should
should really ah
I mean I I I understand that some people some um
relationships they work equally I know they both hustle and they both help each other despite
I think as a man we should be the ones who
to represent ah the relationship and should provide and to make sure that we are the ones
are there emotionally financially for our partner ah
we can't rely too much on our partner cause I don't know I think this is a culture that has been set
legit you want to see your son being fed and you want to pay the bills you have to work ah you have to sacrifice that small portion
for your child for that love in order for them to grow ah
I think you have to find ways on how you can make do
all the missing time that you have uh have with your child ah
they
they have they they have maids to take their child
for some other other races they maybe they ask the grandparents to
to take care of the child so there's a bit of the bond family bond there lah I guess
but ya I think it that that part it's it's it's it's sad lah but we have no choice lah we are living in a country where
money is our priority ah over love ah
unless I think rare cases where you are living and you're having a good career
a good paying job
at the same time you can meet your
you can have the bond with your child with your son or daughters
but then again it's all about really the the time ah you have to make sacrifices ah
we have to make do with what we can ah no choice
so really ah it's really about upgrading ourselves make sure you you have proper planning
and make sure you can provide ah
uh both partners know what to do both partners know what are their responsibilities
and then we can grow
it's all priorities ah eh
okay bro
alright
alright bro see you around bro
bye

hello hello eh hi
what's good
got this like you know very tired stay at home
I'm quickly
how about you
theme park that one got the universal studios singapore
mm
women who who who
oh
ya actually that one sia the
uh what work uh work from home and like all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard lah because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
then you can
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like what or they use Zoom ah
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward ah because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
so I don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say eh teacher how to do this one
you know
oh god but then now that at home right
during class all I keep watching Tik Tok ah then
ya got the that one the
when dissolved then thomas super previously

ya I can go inside the toilet
no no like when you go inside toilet then when you pooping like that no one can see your legs so you don't scared
like it's a it's a very stupid question to ask

I just hear the voice
um
annoying but then actually right flying would also be good superpower nowadays
because breakdown then got jam
you can just fly to your destination
no but the thing is you got
your superpower is flying not super strength you cannot carry anyone
oh
you know
true true
you can fly but you cannot carry anyone with you
ya people see superman fly also but they don't care what
you know like there was spiderman one then toby maguire
then he was sending the pizza
then he wanted to send the pizza in like five minute or not he get fired
then after that like he he go behind the ally the change to the spiderman outfit
then after that he like fly out from the ally lah then after that like with the pizza in his hand but he very used to prepare costume
then after that people be like
the spiderman stole the guy pizza
like they they they never they never think that the
he's not the that person is spiderman
I think he just need a secret identity that's why just like that costume
yes
cannot I don't think you don't need a costume can just wear
a like fit that is like fitting to the flyer just wear like a

ya
ya
ya
nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
oh my god Animal Crossing
it's been a while since I touch that game
then that time I go buy the Switch with you right
ya like I buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya I buy like how much ah six hundred plus dollar then I buy with that game the Diablo three
ya but then like when I play when I buy only after that I never play you know
I never played the Diablo three I think it became like what I buy I buy for
eighty five dollars then after that I never even like
I never even play that much like I only played it like maximum like fifteen times
like fifteen minutes fifteen
then actually I spent almost one hundred dollars on like Animal Crossing for no reason
ya
it was a bit sad lah but then
damn you should play it
oh my god you just now just saw you say miss bae right like miss bae from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school sia I haven't been to like visit secondary school
why you don't want
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the one I was I was the one I was of his first student
no I was his first student
first one
okay ah I might be the worst ah but like I'm I'm I'm the first
I'm the first at the best
ya no lah he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be without him right I think I already fail art
O O level
ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister irman
that teacher
then after that like uh I because he got too many students then after that everytime I ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his his uh attitude ah he's like he would prefer to like uh uh give his attention to those who are better you know
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like uh
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
um
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
uh what ah it became like
I just did a photoshop lah of people like climbing onto the that was very old
oh
ya
and then I just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene lah so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya eh I remember you were doing also ah but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
oh my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the
it's very hard to use your focus on your and your studies at the same time
ya
uh
trail
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic kan
ya
tired
even in english also I can say like tired lah
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me ah in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
it's
ya
but
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army ah even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because sui sui in engineering
mm got chemical engineering
you know
ah
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you oh we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like what five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst one is the people who who already have high pay lah because their
their lifestyle is already like uh I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard lah
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
eh why gym close ah cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
oh my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was originally like a
uh
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase ah then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good ah because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay ah obviously there's some limitations ah
but
ya he went to the extent
no ah because his house was too small like he he he showed uh showed the
like programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
ya
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
savage love ya I don't know but then like
it's quite cool ah because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun ah
oh my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren tan that one or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like eh you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside ah like what if what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable sia but I like the concept
it's like
yes
ya
mm but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
oh my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during eh during primary school
um
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like uh they showed uh around lah like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube kan
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
ya
a'ah
ya
more thick
to make it more thick
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything ah
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant ah I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like uh
actually I saw this one whole circuit
oh like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenhouse effect ah
ya question ah
oh my god
bicycle
excursion ah
their did mature more environment friendly too
unknown doesn't put like mature discipline implements
oh my god ya you know they they estimate the island to be like filled up by like I think twenty forty or something like not even that far away sia
ya we'll be fourty then like also like eh oh my god eh ti you know what's the best way to make singaporeans like not use plastic bags
where
make them pay for your plastic bags
because singaporeans don't like to pay extra for anything
you just stand oh the plastic bags extra twenty cents
you know like nowadays at supermarket right they always do like the
uh if you never bring your own bag you pay ten cent for each plastic bag that they use
ya
ya sia you know like especially all those aunties right
you know like you tell them eh plastic bags cost fifty cent now ah they they'll be like oh my god oh my god then they will like buy their own bags one confirm
because right especially these aunties right I see some of the aunties ten cent already they don't want to spend extra
then
ya sia they they will like be more inclined to like confirmed buy one
um
oh my god then that time right I was so proud ah
ya
change the world make the world more better
I never listen ah michael jackson
ya
I don't know your auntie but then your auntie like like what kind of things
oh
ya
ya
they always flex their Adidas Fila what what other shop Nike also

ya
ya but then anyways ah so what what you planning to get for your auntie since anyways like everyone like buying their own thing right so you cannot buy anything expensive for her what you gonna get

my is social media and web development I have photoshop I know I know coding I can get amazing jobs

ya

I'm fine thank you
how's your family
ah
ya second one is a boy right
oh I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
oh
uh I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it um you might know them because some of them are our former ah schoolmates
oh you're into baking now wah that's nice wah must try some of your cake soon ah
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
ah movie but ah during this pandemic kind of hard lah because I think with the crowd control and all
wah netflix and chill ah
err I don't know uh only so far only a few have confirmed but uh
I will update you ah on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can lah uh
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
ah
um but is it too young for them to start
um going to tuition at this age she's only six years old kan
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that err everyone is competing uh so
it's
it has its pros and cons ah like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
ya but
slowly lah but surely uh I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important lah they just try their best lah
and
I I do have other maybe uh I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
oh oh
orh okay okay I understand I can ask for you lah then
err we'll see what we can arrange
err
wah you sit down at coffeeshop ah I thought you atas one
oh you you full time housewife ah
good lah
actually it's better for to me lah personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
um like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore err I think err
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive ah then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day uh some owners also like abuse their maid lah so that's not right lah I feel
ya there's uh the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse ah think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news lah but you just have to be updated lah now with the
COVID nineteen ah I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that lah before they are cleared to do cleaning oh mm
oh must take care of your health now lah
like but I think if now if you go to any
uh I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya lah for those who are working lah they will give you like
to check on yourself
err so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ah
uh alhamdulilah so far
I'm okay lah maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest uh because of work ah
um politic lah then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what uh
safety measure measurement at work mm cause yes
now currently we have this installation uh of doraemon at the national museum it's interesting lah but
unless I'm there lah then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ah
uh
uh claim it
oh usually you go to johor ah and do your shopping
I think so far our government has done well lah to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
mm
oh
ah so it's like
uh they have different sizes lah and
uh they cater also for kids
mm
mm
ya true
ya
ya but surprisingly
I think they are currently
preparing ah for phase three to roll out but ya lah depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert lah it's important lah for us to be on alert
ah foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
mm
ya lah
mm
you know
stay home notice ya
and I think uh for those who are coming in I think
uh they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure ah I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required lah eh even when they come in they have to do the swab test lah
ah
ya thankfully
a
mm yes yes
uh I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the uh the conduct the test
was mm asked to leave I think he got a job as a security lah err and considered is also a high risk because err he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm uh
but actually they're paying quite
high lah is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that lah because they don't want to
be in contact ah ya don't want to be exposed to this uh and even when he he's finished his job think he ask uh his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can uh remove his clothes outside his house uh ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace lah so it's just an
additional steps ah precaution ya
ah
ya you see
ah so it's not easy ah it's quite
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
a few cartons eh I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe lah
got some quality is not that good ah
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask ah
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but
no lah I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last lah err for a few months then but you have to
wash lah I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse lah
mm
err according to the
safety measurement I think
mm
ya can okay lah that's an idea but
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
mm
ah three kan mm
mmhmm
mm
feels also quite sad lah for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something ah but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad lah but it's better than not having no job and all lah ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya lah
ya lah it's tiring lah even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now uh doing grab but grab is also affected err think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he uh took back the car ya but still it's not doing well lah he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental uh
to the family lah
mm true lah I think
the government implementing a lot of err help for those
need them ah they also I think they have set up this um united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need lah ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march ah I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya lah things will get better lah think I think for singaporean ah they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases ah that can affect us
prata
uh there's a prata at sin ming I think it's quite nice it's run by a family uh father and a son
can can um
can ah maybe I want to try eat the briyani ah
the briyani is quite nice ah I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best ah
err what do you want to order I help you order
the briyani or the prata coin is also nice
and it's
I think just the right
taste ah
can
uh I think I eat briyani with uh fried chicken lah mm because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking ah
then what drinks do you want
teh peng teh peng
teh with ice eh
ya but I think is not that good to always drink teh with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better lah at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health err and also see what eat we eat
ah and also see what we eat
okay
can
uh
anything else
wah there's a lot of people in the queue
ya
digital
uh you order lah since you are very good using app
um briyani chicken
ya fried chicken
mm
ah yes
oh so we have to pick up or
oh okay oh that's
ya I understand but err I volunteered with err an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food err to buy groceries so that they will minimize err their movement outside ah so they can actually err contact us and have like medication
uh you can buy for them and then send it to their homes um
ya lah I think it's a long way to help our seniors uh
because I think if they are exposed to this I think um probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is uh I think done by government agencies ah they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors uh so that they will not be exposed much ah so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies ah then we will be there to send groceries medication uh food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer lah through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask eh for more information lah ya
um
free ah
mm
ya
communication
is
mm
mm
ya lah
data
mm
oh the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort ah to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal ah
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya think
when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide lah
ah
the social distancing ah
mm
mm
ah social distancing ambassador
mm
ah

mm
okay
same until I got C for my malay

ah
h one C eh
I hope it's accepted to actually talk like this but I think so eh because it's they say is to to talk normally
mahadhir
oh ikmal
wow
ah just saying it's recorded again
okay um
um eh but actually you know I was thinking kan actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line kan
kan you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
err
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if lah I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting lah
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
ya
ya okay
hmm
mm
ah
ah
okay
mm ya ah
ah okay I
err
saying it to the people listening to this err we are currently students and if you have any err
part
ah
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
I was cutting you so
oh twenty seven more minutes
eh that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from eh
just gone
statistics eh
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
I told cause I
err maybe bell curve also lah
no lah but actually is is is helpful for those that
err don't do well eh wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
actually it doesn't help hor
you just fail
oh ya actually he's true ah
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this eh
no nobody can see your forehead
okay ah just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
um
maybe five metres
overhead eh no overhead bridge is four point eight metres oh four point five ah
oh you want to take
class three ya err
okay lah
ah I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips ah
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
that place let's call it um
eh I took my err I would say I took as school students so not private lah
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
err
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard err they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
but I would say the no lah not my age lah
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
I just pick the cheapest lesson lah so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
mm you think you are correct or not
you think
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
ya some more I I was so pissed lah but then
I think at that point I was just still
yes
so the first two times
err it was last year twenty fourth december err because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
err my test and then
err it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
err
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard sharul ya and then I heard sharul ya this year then I heard sharul pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
and then I was
ya then some more
err during my
so my test was err example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this err I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson

like struggle so much lor if not wah walao eh if you always like you push away everything right then you just want to focus on that marriage marriage or wedding ah
it's a wedding

correct is focusing on the wedding instead of you focus on the marriage cause if you don't know leh like you spend so much so much on
one day and then you struggle for so many months for that one day ah walao eh

the rental that's the good part ah
so in a way he bo pian ah he come down ah
I mean just their style lah so so he bo pian ah he bo pian he like err so I text him like eh you jamming ah huh
ya true
oh beat a
okay lah but at least you guys went tour already sia
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
musically very strong ah
ya
ah
ah that's good
those dark waves
with little cost ah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
ya
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours eh is also to me an opener ah it's still fun ah it's still fun ah I mean as following tour ah so
yes
ya lah
but then again also I think it's not also about touring ah I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring ah you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe ah then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
ya so
mm mm
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
that's why
scared sia
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person ah
but ah lal recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs ah one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas lah lyric lyric wise would be dol lah cause his lyrics are actually very good
hakim fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
ah skate punk like a lot of
hakim is very propagandhi
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part ah
confirm blast kan
oh oh farhan eh
but but
ah ya
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel lah you can also hear that is double ah like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
right
I don't know ah is their style ah
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song ah that kind of vibe ah but then
ah ya ya
ya relevant bands ah
they they they they suck life ah or they suck ah actually personally I don't listen to them already ah like rarely listen to them
penny wise will still be that sound ah cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
err still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album what
last year ah not bad lah but still the same sound ah
I like penny wise but I still prefer
ya ah professor professor sia vocalist professor siol sia
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene ah they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like err surfers and skateboarders mah
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets ah but they are very intelligent people ah
tony hawk pro skater eh
no I don't like him ah
but cannot ah
but okay lah see how lah missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause wan G got a new bass
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
ah I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape one then he just need to redo the everything ah so he give to hakim hakim
maggot maggot ah maggot setting up for him ah then he gonna after that we jam ah
composer
all of us ah together but wan G is the one that do everything lah so
yes err so we input ideas lah ah like but but wan G will will wan G will do first lah at home then after that after he do
I don't know he ah to me it's okay lah
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something lah and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said eh
err better ah
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound eh I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
do it fast ah cause we delay too long already ah ah so we we we say never mind lah we we we told hakim next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you ah but because we already comfortable eh and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff lah
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like ah ah recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
ah bass man ah it I think is
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky ah I think I think he's damn lucky ah like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
good sounds for the band lah
so far his recordings are actually good ah his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good ah for me lah personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient yadi is lah
cause must commit correct must commit
cause hakim is very hardworking that is his his income pe his livelihood pe
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands lah but from what
sia
no no no he he got another reggae band
err
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer ah ya ya ya rizal
so I think recorded there also
err even stoned revivals ah remix sound that song oh no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it err make it into malay also err I think goodil eh
ya lah but how they do it right is like err err
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia esam esam australia esam will record
err we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here ah
ya but it also depends on him what he I don't know but
don't know ah but
I I don't know ah but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay lah I think zad also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good ah
youtube siao he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out ah into it ah
yes correct
but then see lah maybe maybe in future lah maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest ah but one thing about zad I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good sia cause he feels paiseh lah want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use lah I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks lah cause it's a wear and tear
ah
that's why
of course
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable what it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay lah I mean I understand
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
ah we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him lah if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever lah run everything if ah confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury lah so then
at least you know before to record we come here lah we help you to shift the whatever lah amp
ya shift the mic lah whatever then you just tell us what to do then we help you run then everything goes on cause we we willing to help cause we know you have the potential sia
you're the
go to in a way go to guy you know
err cause of what you produce ah
so we'll see lah
don't know lah
I know he he some more him being very anxious guy
err so he needs to get out
he confirm don't want
he confirm don't want
ya lah
no the thing is the no the walk that time the plan right zad was okay zad wanted to do it he injured what
ah
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental ah mental ah it's it is more of mental
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend what then then we just walk ah so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to punggol end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk ah
ah but azil also said never mind ah we take it slow ah don't don't
don't force yourself lah you know then to give up also now is like wasted sia ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself ah

ah ah but but is like you walk walk eh park connector park connector then you see eh sengkang already
the other end then you go in front another bridge oh that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of sengkang
then you go to punggol so that from punggol the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay ah this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just sumang

campus radio

based on experience ah just saying
okay
free
huh
okay one thing that I wish was free
err
it'll be hard ah
transport
just free transport for everybody
it would cost a lot of but then the thing about that is that
a lot of people will take more transport then it will be over congested
unless other places but I've heard like some other countries also like actually provide free transport
I've heard
yes yes eh actually that's very good points ah a'ah sia healthcare

greenland
wah such a nice view
legit perfect
there's mountains and shit
uh
which don't have army eh
probably those cold countries ah so we gonna say greenland
they switch
from what I hear is
that
oh they switched it because ah during war times and whatnot so they are like trying to trick the enemy
something like that lah that's why they switched the names
but I'm not entirely sure ah
unfortunately ah unfortunately
eh but thank god though
like hundred fifty per month
to like support
two days ago
then I'm like oh
okay lah go
ya of course ah
oh that's it
oh damn
oh damn
yo that's some levels of discipline
that some levels of discipline respect respect
um
technically we already reach one hour ah on my clock already
now it's sixty minutes and thirty three second thirty four thirty five
a'ah
others

hi hamzah
uh no contract ah
um ya but then
the new plan iphone eleven so you pay about
four hundred dollars
but I think minus fifty because got voucher
um
every month
pay fifty five so it's almost double ah
okay bottom western epitope so calculate um mahjong
what okay two years eh so it's two years times fifty five dollars
times twenty four months kan about extra seven hundred dollars ah kan
but iphone eleven uh how much ah iphone eleven now
ya the lowest one lah I think thirty two
okay
um
ya I check a bit the difference is about the incoming I think free eh same ah same um
twenty I think
I think
maybe less than ten ah maybe seven also
a southern or northern her window kaliyah asean
um ya lah almost four years ah
ah that's why
ah sorry again
oh but but that time kan that time I pergi tu apa um challenger kan iphone seven
is two hundred and seven two hundred and eighty dollars I think seven ah but seven also like
also present lobang ah no haunted
ah no contract
but
no but
oh oh K then
oh
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight
mm
but
ya but now starhub plan ah the iphone eleven is cheaper than iphone X
no what are they doing
ya
oh
oh then uh how how's your job search
then um
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now eh all the interview ah
the developer they eh you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
this kind of coding test kan
oh
the the you must type the code inside
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
mm
okay
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
ah I think they really keep calling you know
it's like
very pushy ah so like
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
ah what is the maximum lah the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm ah kan because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit ah pointless kan
so like
ah I forgot the word lowball ah something like lowball ah
no no value ah kan
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
it's not permanent ah but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
be eager to you know um ya
join the company like this
ah mostly
so tuition
but ya that's why
so that time middle of october kan so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months ah kan so actually
I think one or two weeks before ah two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right ah so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest ah maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same ah one week difference I think
the normal tech
huh
ya
because like the hall
it's like a big group ah then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better lah until october
data entry lah you know those
just typing on excel kan basic ah
ah office ah and typing or sending email those basic admin work ah
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description kan is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said um they said okay monday to friday the timing is um I think
about five to ten ah or four to ten like five hours ah or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
um for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply um sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear ah
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer ah so
like but mostly mostly also must support ah because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support kan
so phone support is a bit too much ah you know
ah that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable kan it's a it's it's python programming considered high level kan
uh they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
mm
it's called ah fortran
A N ya
is it C hash or something hash
ah C sharp
huh golac
G G O L A C eh
oh golang
mm
okay then
because
building kan
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these ah data and then maybe
a bit of support ah the support kind of role ah
because like for me last time I work in a bank kan
twenty nineteen ah twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
kan
that time I work in a bank kan so
so um laymans kan the back end ah so
you know logs kan you know logs
L O G S ah log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
go to back end and then take everything out lah
then investigate maybe or something
um the front part is a investigation ah
but the it's like ticket ah like they say what
support and ticket and then
uh raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close ah
then last what you call that analyse ah whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite um interesting or it's it's quite a
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called uh run the bank ah not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means um
it means that the the app is ongoing ah you understand like it's not a project ah that means the project already finish that means it's live ah live product being used by users ah
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china uh all this so the timezone all weird weird one
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us what
ya then their working hours until our six what so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues what I think there's only one period that
low low what low traffic eh
ah nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven ah because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead what only lah then just wake up what that time
because there's two countries new york eh no two states
new york and where ah san francisco right ah
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server ah
I don't think so ah or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank ah our local bank so ya the business not so much ah
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this ah this basic functions ah kan
oh they call it the green eh green lane eh
but but
we cannot go right
ya but somebody must handle that what
they can come
ah they they can say ah ya they can use the fact that their house right at clementi need to do something ah right collect the mail the mailbox ah because
um
but the the tenant kan you know the eh now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail ah
who
okay
cousins uh
they I think busy also ah
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight ah
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
huh
mm
so there's money
it's not in the fridge eh
oh
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
fry the eh fry the fish first right
I think the it ah the the the preparation is a
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife ah hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid ah
but it's it's good if you have a maid ah but
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house kan so one maid right um share our woodlands house
they maybe my future house or your future house ah so then like the maid right
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else ah like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first ah
hmm
ya
no but I think
internally kan if
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off ah right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal ah because um as long the maid
huh
normally the maid off sunday kan one day off kan
ya
but I think they're a bit
eh
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map kan is fixed ah
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual ah
ya then if the stock finish
oh wah cool ah
so call move ah
I think no but
I think I think ah Singapore difficult because you know why or not
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental ah
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface ah the mapping kan the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue ah kan
but they they can they will monitor your work ah
oh ya ah standard meeting ah kan
oh last time that time zoom you all also use zoom ah
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people kan during the COVID
really ah
huh they going to open here ah
ya but singapore smart ah I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues ah
oh good ah ah are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not ah now
ya
oh open already ah I don't know ah
half ah
I think half of that
eh I think because I think
susah nak apa kita
ah predict the people kan because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
oh actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those um
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what ah counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot ah like last time I went I went exchange also same ah I I
because most people will eat solo ah because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so
the counter table is like just one person ah then you face the you face nobody ah like you know face like a the wall or something ah so it's like against the wall kan
ah actually they should make like that
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
serangoon garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor lah you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting ah like like al-ameen at our place the the woodgrove kan
ya open concept ah like is is like sheltered lah
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person ah then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side tau that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
so that means like the four of you ah or three of you kan will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing ah but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then ah section off like one table instead of six right become four lah you know
I mean they can do that lah but I think
maybe today they change lah because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
or if they more than five
so I think recently there's a news ah then they like to inter change like I think they
but I think
but must pity the the business owner ah for because actually right like very strict ah I mean eh it's it's not the kan
uh eh it's so they are very strict ah
so
I think some of the
kan complain ah like oh call police ah I don't know what they call ah they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually oh at first maybe they ask them to go out lah say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
another search ah you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy kan
ya I think maybe like they have a counter lah like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't ah what you call that scan out ah checkout from the place
huh
ah trace together kan
oh that one
oh because of bluetooth ah
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
oh
so like between ah android and they also know what to do right
ya
um
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google ah kan
I don't know ah because like maybe I want to try Google ah but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air kan
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini eh
you can play um I mean you can play the eh what's it called ah the radio station like singapore radio station
ah live streaming ah as long you got wifi lah
so actually from the wifi eh but actually dangerous oh I realise kan they recognise our voice oh
the google home speaker ah I mean the I mean google home ah
because right that time kan my friend kan
so
I ask google ah using my voice ah like when is my birthday or what is my age ah something
then they know ah cause I think like google gmail ah all this something
so like they know uh something like my birthday or my name ah
then because my friend got google phone right
oh there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker ah the google home speaker kan then he ask um like what is my name or something ah
then the google know that it's him then say his name
ah or birthday ah ah I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess what
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person what
ah so a bit scary lah I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community kan instagram or something kan
but if the wifi off kan but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device kan
so will it still listen
um connect you
to the
but default ah but if you ask like questions like um
ah offline what do you call it offline data ah
what basic basic functions ah kan
ya
it's good ah
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon what a lot so
I think because they also got money ah so their apartment like one room one bedroom ah so like those studio ah
got how many version ah I also don't know ah
smart home device ah
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven kan like is there a brand for smart oven now
oh
oh
got smart shower or not I don't know
oh but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there lah because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen ah I don't know
or voice ah
eh but that means right COVID better what if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene kan then I think maybe future ah singapore the lift also maybe smart kan
or lift system
I think can make right
oh the base I mean there's a pedal kan
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working ah so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens kan too many screen one is left one is right kan
because you card is only one level ah

test and
okay hi I'm amir I and my partner salamah
okay so first conversation was how
a bit
but I think it's the perfect time ah
I mean when it comes to like face mask from what
then
ya ya ya the step cool kind I mean is also to prevent like you like at higher speeds like around you are cycling down
like you will either injure or just things going your
face your nose or your mouth lah
okay ya so I was cycling because I was doing part time
ya but that is okay not compared to there was a time ah I was like
cycling down to woodlands just to meet my my my girlfriend my ex girlfriend lah
you you imagine you
I mean it's it's better that you chewing it what like you chew I I don't even know what I taste but
I mean it's just
after that I was okay ah so I think the house fly was
ya I guess so I was fine
ya you don't know meh
ya lah it's just that I got the most freshest one lah
ya I
ya
yes I'm I'm taking my bike license lah my motorbike license like
I
I don't
deliver ten then you will get incentives like maybe for grabfood was ten dollar
you divide it a extra extra five dollar ten dollar then after you deliver hundred than maybe extra
I mean I I work for both
I mean not this is not advertisement lah but then
they grab the deliveroo their support is like way better lah
it's not a tipping thing ah like the culture
ya
second second
bro that one that one is I mean that one depends like I mean you cannot
that one is they give big tip is maybe
ten dollar
the app like you give you ten dollar that will get the ten dollar because some countries like for example in like happening in other places I think like the their
like it's just
ya I got it for six eh four hundred plus lah like because
I mean long term ah and I think I really gain back that four hundred I've
ya ya
I mean
sometimes you see
they those like
food delivery they like I mean
blind blind spot
I I think I might feel fail someone from the the the I was like on the road going junction then there's a light then on my left is the zebra crossing ah
ah
there was no nothing no one else on the road on the road was me
I mean but
you license ah you
so you know how the the most dangerous thing so now you technically you will go out ah as a motorcyclist style more car then you will like maybe can put yourself in other shoe ah
so I think
but before that defensive riding lah
so
ya
but I think I
ya
no
ya
thirty six when it comes to revision outside or the the the test outside is sixty or so around fifty plus
six or five
ya
I I think the bike I'm looking for is err the one like my friend is riding I think one five zero or one five
ya ya okay that one I
I I don't even know what
those brands are like ah because I think the one that everybody using that have been recommending me fuel efficient is the I mean somewhat fuel efficient is one five zero ah
seven more years or seven seven or seven more years ah
like I I need to decide first whether because like if I were to do my work
ya
I just keep renting ah depends on like what bike I want then
like at the at the like a dead end
what was the question I have to remember oh was it something like okay what is the
ya ya yes yes
freighter then I noticed the mere driver was my one of my teammates
um
like
so
my birthday present I think honestly now
so I think
ah ya
I mean I am okay grand if it's just the person that I want
ya
ya lah I mean but like honestly
like like what you say lah or whatever if the person has done but then ya lah but
like you have to know what the person like intention of what a birthday is lah for me
they have to know lah like like it's not gonna be feasible lah for the rest of their life if they wanna do something like often but then with his once in lifetime you let people celebrate their twenty first birthday something grand then like okay lah whoever their close friends planning gonna plan like really
so I think when it comes to birthday it's like all ultimately is do you want to grand or not
but I think when it comes to like if I were to choose a place to go out maybe not just birthday lah a holiday or something eh
I think I will most probably do something
like maybe like if
like I would think or maybe going to east west of like of the like a road trip or just maybe just like go japan north to south that's that's what I would do lah a road trip
further like whiter they are I mean and when it comes to nearer to the equator you gonna be much more darker lah it's I think that one is like it has been for so long already and just that now people are more migrating more so it's a different more complexion
oh
okay ya so ya lah I mean wait this six hundred is a lot lah so

then end up COVID then they just
then like even lesser people came

hello my name is hady
hello faidil um how have you been
so ya I haven't been out too much lately but I hope it will change in the next few days
okay so I have um the first question for you my first question is um just the other day I was walking outside um an apple store at white sands shopping mall
and I was looking inside and I saw they were selling this new phone ah that apple just released I think probably about a month or two ago retailing about maybe eight hundred nine hundred dollars plus
and I went into the store and I took a look at the phones and I was just comparing it with the old models and I didn't actually notice much of a significant difference in the looks and I read up on the performance not that much of a difference and I was just asking myself um I was wondering why would people fork out such huge amount of money for phone that is so insignificant in its performance or visuals compared to its um
previous models I just wanted to know your thoughts on that
um for me I would one hundred percent say with certainty that I do not think that phones in general should be retailing at four digits like one thousand dollars personally
I like to think that anything above five hundred dollars really is more of a luxury rather than the necessity
and I personally think that there are way more quality phones that you can get the super underrated for less than five hundred dollars and I think it's quite sad to see a company like apple maybe take advantage of maybe hardcore users by simply releasing phones that
are way out of the average person's price range and
I feel like it's obviously a bit sad to see from where it came from from the past years and you know these phones that come in at four digits are not really much to brag about in terms of any innovation that it possesses compared to maybe an iphone that came out two to three years ago and I'll be personally disappointed if I was a fan of apple and see with what they come up with
and I just think that since phones are such a necessity in our daily lives I feel like a one should strive
to aim for a balanced price range versus a top quality performance of a iphone
so ya I mean
so ya that's my opinion
um my second question for you is the past few days the weather in singapore has been really hot
and with err the importance of us wearing mask outside with COVID going on how have you been coping with the blazing weather so far
ah ya for sure I agree
it's crazy to see what the weather is like nowadays you think that living in singapore for twenty years you get adjusted to the humid weather but it seems that everyday it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and obviously we can attribute it to
whatever you know the climate or climate change or you know but I do agree that I think the only way that we can you know try to battle this weather is to stay hydrated keep drinking lots of water and try to get to cool places as often as you can don't stay out in the heat for your own sake
um ya and please don't forget to wear your mask cause for the wellbeing of the people around us
and my next question for you is what is one thing that you wish was free
um ya um that I totally agree with you
I can empathise with with having friends who um don't have great vision and seeing them fork out a few hundred dollars on something that they need
which is the spectacles and obviously is not going to be easy for everyone to afford you know cause
obviously spectacles are very expensive although it is a necessity and if I had one thing that I wish was free I would say something along similar lines I'd say I wish that healthcare was free
cause it's as a person who has been to hospital trips a few times and I've seen the amount of money that not just me but maybe the people around me have to fork out
just to pay their hospital bills and obviously in singapore is I'm very thankful that the government helps us a lot in subsidies but obviously healthcare is also important in singapore first first class
hospitals here and first class treatment and I guess can't take for granted the subsidies that the government gives but
my parents have to fork out some cash and my parent's siblings have to fork out some cash um just to be able to afford and you know help chip in
so in an ideal world if I could ask for one thing to be free I would say free healthcare for everybody regardless of who they are what their salaries status is
mm yes
um that's a good question something that I've thought about since I was a young kid as well I'm sure everybody has thought of it and been asked at some point if I could have one superpower it I guess I have to go with um the superpower of invisibility
and I think it would be pretty obvious why um I think it be pretty cool to be running around and nobody sees where or who you are
I can just board the plane and get past custom without anybody seeing me you know can travel anywhere I want
so ya I I think I'll be a pretty good criminal if I had the invisibility superpower you know it's just I think it'll be pretty fun to say the least
nobody can see us and obviously I hope for it to be
um temporary rather than permanent cause I still want to see my parents
I don't want to be invisible without them seeing me that'll be that'll be pretty bad I'd say what about you
I mean ya that's that sounds great to be honest um mind reading um I'm sure everybody has wanted to do it
um
we can have any planted tube inside our brain you know where we can access one another but I guess for my own personal reasons I wouldn't want people reading my mind you know
I'm sure you agree
um ya of course my next question to you is if you can instantly master three skills
what would be the three skills and why
ah ya before I say the three skills I master I um I agree with your last point about being able to
um be friends with everybody cause as an introvert
I often see myself having maybe a bit of trouble maybe a bit of shyness trying to
interact with the people around me although at the same time it makes me treasure
whatever friends I have now more than anything I have in the world
and right now the three skills that I'd master
the third skill that I would like to master is probably
hmm
I think I would say
being able to master just learning anything as quickly as possible and obviously it sounds more vague I mean I'd say anything cause obviously in life you will come across a lot of challenges and a lot of new experiences and
I think it would be great if I could just learn anything at hand just instantaneously cause
obviously I don't want to fall behind and you know let's say I enter the workforce and and um you know there's something new to be learned or something new to be
to be found out then I guess I would like to be able to learn it as quickly as possible
just for the for my own benefit
and moving on my next question to you is
do you watch and if so what genre of do you watch
from ya I mean ya actions sounds great um I I also want to ask you what what kind of movies or shows do you watch regarding that topic
maybe
dwayne the rock johnson maybe
um ya that I mean I mean I'm not personally I'm not a big fan of action myself I think I would rather access my emotions cause my favourite
genre of
or movies I'd say is definitely romance cause I'm a bit of a softie myself so I like to cry
some of my favourite shows or movies of romance I'd say for shows I would go with master of none starring aziz ansari
it's really great it really got me in my feelings
for movies there's a lot but I name my top three I'd say number three I would say maybe um five hundreds days of summer
starring um zoey deschanel number two maybe I'd say her starring joaquin phoenix and number one I'd say lala land starring emma stone and ryan gosling
obviously any movie starring the rock and kevin hart
those are absolute blockbuster movies and they always live up to their names
um ya and
regarding the questions about I'd say in this generation maybe is not quite the medium where we watch movies nowadays I think most of us would want to watch it on our phones
or maybe on a tablet where it's easier to access I mean obviously it's a shame to see dying out but
ya this is the new medium and most of us have already adjusted to it
I I agree I personally myself for romance movies I
my favourite movie itself indeed it's not the ending is not the cliche of
other like other romantic movies in fact the ending it's not cliche itself was the reason why I was crying so much cause it was so unexpected
so ya I mean it's hard to pick out something that is so good and and maybe a genre that is so saturated with just plain jane movies that we seen over and over again
and so now my next question to you is along the lines of and movies if you could become an actor or an actress who would it be
um ya johnny depp is indeed a fantastic actor who doesn't love pirates of the carribean right well personally I would say if I could become an actor I would
want to become ryan gosling
obviously cause he is in my favourite movie lala land acting with my favourite actress emma stone
so you know if I could take his place that will be pretty sweet and I mean the guy has acted in quite a lot of great movies like nice guys and and I guess his sense of humor and how he says it in a dead in a deadpan way
I kind of see his resemblance or my resemblance in him so ya I I like him
I mean I mean to be honest if one day I woke up as johnny depp um I won't be complaining to be honest but ya I guess johnny depp and ryan gosling personally really not
the same type of actor maybe
or maybe play the same type of movies
I mean you have your own opinions and I have my own taste ah so ya and to be honest I don't really care about who johnny depp dates to be honest
I I more of a fan of the movies that ryan plays so ya
I mean it'd be pretty sweet to wake up one day as a as a famous actor in hollywood
um my next question to you is
would you rather fight one
horse sized otter or one hundred otter sized horses personally I think I would rather fight just one horse sized otter cause
I think I don't think I can handle one hundred of something
and very small but you know it comes in pax so
I think I might get overwhelmed pretty quickly but
it's just a hypothetical and I just want to know what you think
thank you for agreeing with me and my next question to you is on the more sentimental a nostalgic note if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would have been inside that time capsule
if what else would I put inside I probably put in a few of my
xbox three sixty um console disc inside cause I have very fond memories of me playing games on my console when I got back from home
from primary school games like tiger woods tour maybe or maybe like
um
FIFA O nine or FIFA ten
where I would just everyday go home and play it carefreely
so
um ya lah um
just
I can't I can't really think of what else lah to put inside but
if I knew I'd agree with faidil as well
I would put in a note to myself I think it's like it's like what you said lah um I just
I just write to myself and
and just talk to myself about how life how great life was ten years ago
I I really wish I could go back in time ah
so ya that's what I would find inside my time capsule
do you have a question for me
okay sure I I will ask you the question um my next question is
if you had three wishes maybe for yourself for your family or you know you just for the whole world what will you wish for
that sounds like a pretty decent innovation
I I would definitely hope that
wishes
you live a cruel world and it's hard live without money so I just give an infinite amount of cash to
basically every single billion person in the world
you know just drop them a stack of cash so that they can
live a better life
my second wish would be um being the crazy football fan that I am I really wish I could own
chelsea football football club and cause I I really love football and I really love the club so it would be pretty cool to own the club lah cause I think that I can run the club better than its current owner and I think I have some pretty good ideas and on who to buy and
you know I can just give myself unlimited free tickets to watch the games so it's I think it's a pretty good package you know if I could ask for it and my third wish would be
um if I had a third wish I would just um in a cliche kind of answer I would wish for everybody to just have eternal happiness cause
it's hard to see your own friends or your own family be down sometimes
and even yourself so it's like it's
I mean obviously everybody goes through rough times but
it would be nice to see everybody live very happily um for until whenever
you know so ya that would be my three wishes I've heard yours
selfish
and my next question to you is
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life
what would it be
um if I could have one dish for the rest of my life
I mean I I take it as my meal for the rest of my life but
ya
I think
it's more of a sentimental dish rather than a dish of
you know something more extravagent like you know maybe a steak
maybe wagyu beef maybe
but no I would think my own mum's dish
is it a job that like any job I can choose
I would choose
I would take two jobs one job I would want to become an actor
in hollywood cause that's something that I always wanted to do
cause there's a lot of people I admire in the industry
um
I really like the work that they do and you know how they always um
the first people when the news breaks so
the first people to report on something new happens
I feel like the thrill of the job
is something that I can never get bored of
um um
there's always something satisfactory that I can look forward everyday
what about you
um wow um those three jobs sound great
and you know I will move on to the next question now
the next question is
good looks or a fake body
what would you prefer
I think would say that
a girl's personality is number one right
that's that's just what I think lah obviously everybody has their own preferences but if
I think if given a choice I would give a girl I would get a girl with a banging personality
over someone with a face like a a ten lah what about you
um ya of course personality is always number one
and obviously we cannot judge a person by what they look like judge a book by its cover you know
so ya
um wow um first of all
I
that is a surprising statistic personally
and and I just think that maybe it's maybe it's a taboo for them to talk about it and maybe they are not as open to it as us and obviously suicide is just
is is a is a horrible way to end someone's their their own life and I I hope that anybody who goes through maybe a a depressive phase you know you know troubled times I really hope that they
would seek um a therapist or someone who is an expert to to help them cause it's it's always sad when you know someone who's taken their lives or just
it's just a waste of a life ah and what's your thoughts
um ya for sure um I feel like
um the awareness itself about mental health is very important um obviously in the past few years I think it's been way better now nowadays and as someone who knows somebody else who's who has anxiety who who has gone through depressive phase and knows about it I know about them I I myself am guilty of disregarding their feelings and just telling them to you know
get on with it you know and I as having been there and done that obviously I am very guilty and I feel bad about them cause cause and thankfully obviously they did not they did not end their own lives cause you know they manage to seek help but I guess I guess everybody
why you know has has been there when it comes to disregarding someone's else feelings and I think it's something that as a community I think we all can improve on
how about you faidil
oh should should I go first ya um first of all I'd say there's a lot that I am thankful for to be born in singapore um first of all
I'm very thankful that my parents have been able to live a stable life being here um I myself have been able to been raised up in a good community in a good place living in a block
and um and seeing what my parents have to work for just to be able to afford to send them to school to send them for their hospital meetings all and seeing the cost of it itself I'm very thankful that the government helps to cover and
I know my dad has never said it but I'm quite sure he is very thankful as well
and I I just hope that
me and the people around me will be able to work hard and just live a stable life in singapore
how about you faidil
um I also like to give a shoutout to all the nurses who work during the COVID um period we are also very thankful that they putting the hours everyday cause it's been a it's been crazy times for singapore for the whole world and it just I like to give my appreciation I'm sure my friend faidil feels the same way and with that I faidil thank you for talking to me today I'm sure we talk about a lot of stuff a lot of different stuff today did you have a good time

ya I have to ask dewi to do research lah then from there
ya lah and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding mah
okay
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
mm
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause err lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
mm okay
ya
whether to see okay

then everything finished at twelve thirty
eh wait ah
I remember is a eleven to three ah ya
okay
ah I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
err
that is the main main core concept
oh I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
she don't care
yes
ah that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
then one thirty
lunch time

I haven't decided whether to
to stay stick with the same class or
change
ya I think but less movement now lah
less moving around in school
shouldn't be lah it should be easier for the teachers
during this period

sorry ah why why what happened
okay which man U game was that mm
oh I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david moyes you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when thiago was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
ah
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games ah
am I right okay never mind err who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch tau it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw thiago go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
mm
okay
uh huh
that philosophy ah
okay
the same louis van gaal were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
mmhmm
okay
ya
okay
mmhmm
okay
I see
okay
wow
so he's like the empty football guy
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
okay that's that's the same school ah
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
mm mm
just whack ah basically ah
a'ah
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya
klopp denies you space mourinho mourinho gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with ah but ah okay lah I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean wow wonderful game from a
I mean I mean I mean the work he's one guy who I should have put in the team from the start ah eh how's your by the way
sial ah for
okay so let me get this straight you play a managerial game on your four
okay
ya ya ya best I mean pro evolutions soccer ah
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years ah actually I can play on my iPad also kan
err I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically err ah I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
err so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated err Netflix show
okay but anyway err
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix lah cause
what happened was uh when september now eh so last month err
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
err I was like okay lah feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
hey there's this anelka documentary on Netflix
ah have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this anelka documentary ah so so it's uh it's a
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause err
raymond dominic actually like uh had a an argument with anelka
I got into Netflix cause of that anelka documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows lah but some like err okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai ah
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like oh they sell the data
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation ah
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
uh am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like oh you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting lah like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it lah so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and err it's about how this guy err I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder err ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you lah but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town lah that he's in
ah it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean ah okay lah so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places ah one is err knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america uh
err K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so ah basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
is err you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that lah
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so uh and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then err and then and then and then
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story err
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted ah I mean in the movie they they they
ah not not just inner demons ah I mean they are just they are evil people ah you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is ah robert pattison
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something kan
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but eh but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show ah
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie ah
ah well he doesn't he doesn't molest children ah
a'ah
okay
are you sure you want to say this on err are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box ah
oh is it
so basically it's an lah
okay okay
ah
oh is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya lah they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five ah it's like not not even ah
ya ya
mm mm
mm
ya
mm mm
ah ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl kan
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
mm
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that uh they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no lah
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's uh not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
err groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans lah
because of this ah so
so I mean like in singapore dee kosh obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
a'ah
okay
ah
okay
alright
oh my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through ah
okay
ah
okay
he's he's a good kid ah
okay
a'ah ah ah
ah ah
okay
oh okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him oh you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya lah cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that upskirtism
so he actually did it
look eh look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates ah bro
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name ah but but but I don't know but
so basically he was in one of those classes ah
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him lah like I I remember of
his existence back this in ah
yes
ya
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally lah cause he's from that country
maybe I don't know ah maybe we're we're looking at it differently lah maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation ah from what I understand lah
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum ah
sorry syed ahmad we didn't mean to mention your name
oh okay
oh okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
ah we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time ah
a'ah
ah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay
ya
okay
mm mm
ya
look and ya look and behave a certain way ah perhaps ah
a'ah
ah
mm
ya
mm
ya
well I mean what can you say ah these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on ah
and I guess people are just
following trends ah just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
but now is like quite common ah you know nowadays you have mosque
ya lah but you still had your your function in a activity hall ah my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
err I mean there there are some huh
err subject to any of these trends I feel lah
you can lah you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
ya
ah
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that ah you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house lah I don't know whether I told you
bro sengkang bro raeesah khan
oh sorry was that too loud jamus lim
err unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not sengkang but it's okay
no no this is ang mo kio so
ah sorry ah every conversation between zulika and myself must involve some degree of politics lah then you know there's some spice ah
so uh we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come uh we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good ah ah
I I don't want to play games ah I mean I think I would draw the line at games ah
ya
my wife my wife and I oh but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife ah okay
a'ah
okay
wah
that's a very productive err your time bro
oh okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad eh you you should talk
oh my god okay
ya lah he hasn't changed his name yet lah
okay
yes yes yes yes
uh
okay
ah
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see oh ya ya ya ya ya
err so I think his brother died or something eh
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them ah okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago sia
okay
huh
I I've never watch game of thrones ah by the way
of course ah bro ya
there was a prison break movie
yes he died right
wentworth miller
oh okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me ah no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true ah
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it oh ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
oh my god I I thought this was over sia bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
ah
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
a'ah
sial lah bro you could have read all the books seh in all that time sia bro
oh I heard of that but I didn't watch it
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that err I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently lah so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys lah so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
hey siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
ah all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful lah I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
a'ah
uh huh
it automatically scans the code oh okay
it goes in a anti clockwise eh clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
like that
eh so so so err we're coming to the end
okay
oh I think I know what your day is referring to
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
ah both ah

trace together like the
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that lah they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
ya
different timing
ya
can
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely lah I mean you cannot meet lah but
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
oh ya just five of us lah
without partners lor
mm
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us what
korean ya that ah
farin birthday
oh
oh yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners lor that
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya okay
ya
um
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work lah
ya
mm
ya lor
monday right
is it really
ya
oh
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
hais
okay lor we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
then he say it's like seven hundred oh my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred sia
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
you are in a cold room
whoa but luckily I went taiwan sia just before lockdown
ya
err not as good as that one we we went that time
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
hais
hais ya
ya
eh but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
um ya
but you know the that time the who say ah which minister
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably lah elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations lah wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel lah
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
was there lah oh my god
mm
err they have another issue to tackle there oh my god
mm
are you talking about succulent
oh
the normal one cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
mm
oh I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what sia cardboard
oh what
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
hais anyway I have an assignment on an essay lah so I need just err your your point of view lah I guess
mm it's about um
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
why
mm
ya
true leh ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
mm
ya
mm
good what lockdown good what I was enjoying the period
mm
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems lah rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
oh
ya
mm
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel lah like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation lah so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway err
ya lah alhamdulillah I need the money so what's the problem
to avoid this err to convert their platform store into online platform lah so
mm
true I mean you will lose your human touches also lah right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
err
I think it brings families together
kind
that's all lah like
so
ya
I know
not every family can get along lah hundred percent get along so
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one wah then
ya
right ya
mm
ya obviously
ya
mm
true
mm
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better lah because you know carbon footprints were reduced lah I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit lah of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight lah like just
ya
ya
ya
okay lah at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress lah I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit leh
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
mm
ya
maybe they did lah like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
not counsellors lah what what is it calling
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
ya
mm
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes lah but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya eh can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society lah I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case lah on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water one
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito one
it's true okay lah but that's not really a problem I guess
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down lah
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel lah at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot leh
is it
aren't we not at the top
oh we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest lah
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to lah but it's not possible lah per se
oh my god
oh that one that they kill all the animal ah but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus what ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
they have to kill all the the chickens mah
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
yes
mm
uh huh
ya inside the middle ah
uh huh
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese err ah swiss cheese plant
stop it lah
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times leh
what is a prayer plant
mm
ya
mm
but monstera is an indoor plant what right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
mm
ya
ya
technically they are bushes lah weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
not really leh
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt leh
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer lah but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
err the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk leh like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also what light can ah
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
can ah
ya probably can lah I don't know
I don't know it just grows short lah from small to big lah I guess shoots ya
hais
no oh my god that one
no meh
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
ah
mm
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office uh condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
aiya very the
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
aiya you don't know one lah
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
mm oh my god
mm
hais
mm
spray is it then
mm
ah
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
mm
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also what if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
mm
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
mm ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die sia
hmm
oh my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough lah too much plants ah mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant eh
oh no
aiya you don't know one lah
it's like a fern anyway
hais
you don't have class so what you gonna do tomorrow
like for for the whole week to say
ya lor

cannot be less than thirty
ya then it's like cannot be less than
but technically they don't like understand why is it called like you know inflation and then
err haven't planned yet eh for everything leh

blue
I think got got some are brown lah but ah
eh but then that time I already went okay lah technically that was a good day lah but I never catch anything
no not not me lah then the others all catch lah I just relax ah
but then the the best part kan you know this one scary scary story lah little bit lah scary horror so that time I I went there that was like three in the morning three in the morning then then two of my friend ah actually I think sulaiman wasn't there ah sulaiman wasn't with us
so there was I think the five of us if I'm not wrong there was five of us then two of them sleep already
han sleep then I think wan
wah rhyme wan five
then I think you should be wan five lah should be wan five okay
don't ask lah don't ask that was a a bad experience weird experience
ya so we we take the log then we just take some dry logs lah then we just make fire then he was cooking I think he was cooking Maggie mee ah
Maggie mee and hotdog
eh no he he haven't even throw his his rod ya then was three already
because at the right side only got because it was this one is an open area it's an open area
then there was two ways to go to the sea so the three of them go this way me and I forgot who ah I think
han ah we go to the right so um
ya then that that was the first story then the second time I wasn't there ah this one was han han and the rest went I I didn't went there
han already know lah he he got experience before then after that he knows that this one is
um like oh err then he just keep quiet lah
then he he knows already lah then he just stay awake lah then the next day the driver came ah came to pick them up
that that particular
mm
mm
but it's not from malaysia lah oh so they they hear all over
so loud
mm
maybe that that might explain but three in the morning testing mic ah
then when you look out into the sea right you can see there's two paths that goes to the sea then if you go to the left
ah I think it's like fifteen minutes drive it's ten to fifteen minutes
ya ya ya if I'm not wrong because in the when we fish
in the morning when we wake up or is it we ah ya in the morning we fishing fishing fishing then the people all
sailing in front then we like no no don't don't then we see our rod move alamak
then you are literally pulling the kayak
ya balance things out lah huh
lah kan eh
mm
mm
but how many how many jobs have you applied for
then all the all the sentence all english
that's why
then err
ya lah
ambassador
okay is that's that's north right
central err ah ya
mm
within the week
within the month
ya
ya lah
surrounding surrounding
ah okay I think I I understood
okay okay
because of that
ah
so what you did you tell anyone no ah
but but whose that middle person
mm
then different different person
mm
fandi ahmad
wah
mm
mm
ya that's why lah is
who will be the one main speakers ah who would be the main speakers in the
in the forum itself then fandi ahmad at the back because he's just a guest maybe you you can explain it like that lah
ah
game lah
mm
a caricature lah
mm
but this is but this one is what is considered as a volunteering or are they paying you
say you wanted to help ah
ya
ya lah ya lah
ya lah
mm ya is a
ah
yes
ya
then after that then the way I see you edit ah aduh is just to edit like a one minute sequence like
that one was one minute that video was one minute itself and it took us what three days just to edit one minute
the way you wanted it now you say the client don't want it
definitely lah
eh feelings feelings
say goodbye
sulaiman
tolong
so
I must I must say that it's not we start the day is we start the night but our night is not the day the day
oh
err podcast
per month ya
so we can only select up to three so that time I picked three jobs one is
paying me one point eight one is paying me one point five and the last one was only paying me one point two so
I applied I forgot this job pays me which one because by the time I accept it I went to check back they take down the info like how much they pay whatsoever it's just the address lah the address of the company then after that then I was like okay lah at least I know I'm getting paid
at least one point two lah
the same exact thing that I'm telling you I I told them so it's like I think at least one point two lah eh cannot be what no there's no there was it's just allowance
then after that then then the thing is I went to the boss I went to the boss then after lunch I went to the boss
the thing is my company is just a small company is a so there's only like ten to twelve of us working
so I went up to the boss after lunch and eh boss uh can ask you something ah yes yes what you want to ask I just want to ask ah the the allowance
is one thousand ah because I went to check the internet they say like if I'm not wrong is like one point two or one point five ya we only pay one thousand ah
I think this type of thing you need to check with the school then I'm like
I give it to you
typical malay ah
aduh
actually I so
just asking ah I I I haven't actually really go and see so they are linguists
plus computer science ya
we just keep it simple lah keep it simple
mat-mat mat-mat ah
nothing lah it's nothing nothing much
ah so little bit lah just just to cover up that that last seven minutes now I guess six minute yes
so go apply school lah ah oh ya talking about
said so we are going back one hour ago
so
because I I myself also got um work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is ah the pay to me is I tell you lah it's quite it's quite ah quite decent for I would say err part time lah because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get lah so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that one is motor lah but ya lah but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders ah per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
a good place for you to like start lah then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
marina barrage
marina tower
marina got what marina bay sands
six hours
huh so fast wait you run or you walk you walk
so fast then why why when we
maybe maybe we I should I should start with you ah what nine five five
five five eight

oh what was the last movie you watched on netflix
mmhmm
oh
house
don't know
oh it's a comedy
mm haven't watch it
wah
true
ya that's true
huh oh
ah
I think the last movie I watched was movie eh I haven't watch movies in awhile but I watch like series
ya
the acting is not that great the the also not that great lah but
no it's british ya
it's quite interesting lah I mean the storyline also not that amazing but it passes time
ya
the boys
on netflix
oh
oh
mm
oh
okay
mmhmm
mm
mm
like what what's the storyline about like what basically happen
okay
amazon prime I don't have sia but might I might subscribe cause got a lot of like interesting shows I've heard and netflix is like running out of stories
isn't much left
ya
amazon prime
orh
ya
mm
interesting
mm
I know you take forever to watch a show
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm true
mm
I think they did it was like fourteen the last time now it's like sixteen
oh great
haiya it went up
ya they added now
ya
mmhmm that day I received this
ya but I don't know ah I think not yet
true
mmhmm
oh
oh wow
what is it about
but what is your course like mainly about
huh okay
oh yes
I mean that's fun I guess managing a business
mm
uh huh
mm that's true
I don't know
I mean
oh ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
oh how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
mm
mm
then what happens
true
mm mm
mm
but like
sad sia they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market uh like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game eh without the players what do you have like an empty online page
mm
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
and that's what has been happening what like the
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
kan
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
ya
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that lah
ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
it's probably him ya
I don't know sia
ya and he spent so much on that game also what I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
oh ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want sia
I don't know
cute sia
oo is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
kumbhakarna
yes
mmhmm
mm
oo
and another person orh
hmm that's hard good looks or fit body
mm
then yourself leh
mm
yes
ya
true
true
mm
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
good looks
ya
hmm
no any other day hmm
and
ya
oh ya not not bald lah no lah like as in like short
I don't know I
mmhmm
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
but ya
ah
um
mm ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
like tag along so like
huh really I didn't know
oh you didn't say
did you say oh I didn't see
I didn't
oh no he means he can't even play at all ya
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my
ya
mm
just one mm
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
ya so you like
mm
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
kan
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
oh
I guess
I guess
mmhmm
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to ah like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
yishun
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
ya let's go look for that cow later
is there
interesting we go find out lah
kan
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
oh
I mean the
I mean there's still one that exists that like
she owns the place basically and then like uh
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened lah when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
mm ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like oh I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
like really late and then ah they wanted to start filming at like eight
model or something
so she's quite tall lah and then like um
her features were like pretty lah like
like a model person's features
mm that part that was the one lah
ya
mm ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying lah cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
so like
like wandering around and shit
ya
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
then we just like like we told them lah like oh we're filming a horror movie here
but it's quite interesting place ah cause it's surrounded by
that hut that looks like a kopitiam
but it's exist now ya
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor lah
so like ya
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
oh visit huh there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
the there's a road that goes through the entire place lah so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people lah
and but we only hear like
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like paiseh ah cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
and then um
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like oh wah so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya
she just goes around does that every time
ah but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice ah it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
um
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting ah the place
interesting
um
I honestly don't know ah I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night lah
ya I think same ah if like I had to like
true
but
oh ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
mm
mmhmm
really
that's interesting
uh the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes sia is it even open I think it is already lah if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
pulau semakau that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
three years quite recent lah ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
orh orh
catty
catty enclosure
mm
and jumping on things
mm
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed lah like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible lah to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age sia the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from yishun
yishun has cold weather and move it
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not meh
it was
it was lah cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
uh five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya sia
sec four lah so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
orh
it's quite pretty lah the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and changi airport
hmm
that's a hard question
but legit lah like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
oo
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
hmm
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job oh my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
mmhmm
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
mm
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
oh ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
mm
ya previous
mm money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
mmhmm
mm
so what the hell
wow
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
oh
mm
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
mm
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it ah so like
probably not
mmhmm
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
mm
mm
no one was interested
ya
mmhmm
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay lah to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
mmhmm
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like oops
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
mm
mm
mm
true
mm
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
mm
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
orh
same
I just I cannot imagine like
oh
I was like huh
ya
oh that's weird
the hell
mm
mm
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
orh
mm
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
mm
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
that's when it gets bad lah like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it lah but like it's fine uh it's fine lah he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
oh really
orh
I mean get scared lah like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine lah like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
mm
mmhmm
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic what then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die lah confirm but like
oh
mm
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
mm
is put to use
ya
mm
somewhere else
that needs it
mm
mm
mm
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
ah ya
ya
ya
murderers

nonsensical sia like how

like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like mm
don't know what to do ah
okay then once my

err err what what all the
courses that I whatever paper whatever certifications that I got I
I dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig

one choice a bit too little lah so I choose one more
ya but I only applied for one
like I think
they gave me four options or six option I cannot remember but
I don't know I and ah eh is it I don't know okay okay
so I was like okay err maybe I I put two ah so one was
infocomm security then the second one was

that um the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about err entertainment or something ah
so that I can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should ah so
ya that was when I realised ah so
what I did was I
like uh screw it ah I don't want to apply for this course then I delete it from my option
the moment I delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then I was like oh okay
ya I only applied for one option lah I only put one choice

I see as a I see it as the is it am I too soft or what
blessing in disguise will you say
like you know how he like you say ah is like okay um
revolves around teamwork
team collaboration
team effort
okay so
now
the moment COVID strike
everything is done online on Zoom meetings
whatever forum that they try to
implement within that short period of time to ensure
students still can um collaborate do team effort all that
but I feel like like err this current time this current period is like the the most
err hardest ah I feel
ya
uh huh
something like that
err honestly eh I might
might not lose a lot within this year that I have a gap
I mean I'm still losing money ah that's the main thing ah
uh I mean I guess you can say this recording ah
no lah I mean
honestly speaking I'm trying to look for a job I applied for a job but right now
okay at first I feel like okay at first I thought okay ah maybe I should try to apply something related to what
I want to do in the future
then okay so I look look look see see see for any like opening cause like
most of the people that they're looking for are like oh two three years of
err the experience that you are
relevant ya then I was like what
ya lah ya lah I mean
I can apply but okay you know the
the united
uh traineeship or something like that programme
okay so
okay
august like I was like okay ah
ah maybe I'll get my one more pay in september
you know
you know that that that expectation okay ah so I was like I didn't
I didn't bother to look for any jobs ah during august to september
um early september
like
last month lah
okay okay okay sorry sorry
okay so
I expected september
to get my last pay ah but
then I I I ask me
I ask my lah eh can you help me check
err are we supposed to get paid uh september then he was like ah okay okay I'll get back to you
then after that
ah he he came back and then he said oh no your
how they pay is like
ya you're paid for that
month that you're working
rather than
uh something like that maybe
so
then I was like oh shit
that means like I won't get paid lah on the september
ah
ya
what is that
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
wow
not bad not bad
Adidas eh
ah okay
oh
eh ah
oh oh oh oh
my bad my bad no I I I I mistaken sorry sorry
sixth october that's
I think about a week from now
ah
cause um
bill from their system
okay
so then uh the the person in charge they like oh err
can you come to the
computer here I I check the reason then I was okay they check they check they check then they the
that lady was like oh err are you still are you still in are you still serving
then I was like oh ah I just finished I just like
last week then she was like uh okay okay then I have to remove you from the eleven B scheme oh man
that was like ninety eight dollars
hais
ya lah
ya lah of course ah I I expected I need to pay but I
was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
mm huh
hais
I was like
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that one is before err ah but six months is a very long
think so I don't know lah
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing ah
a'ah
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work ah honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
eh I would not think twice
I just
ya serious ah
one last talk
oh I see
oh I see
uh huh
a'ah
I see I see
no lah okay so uh
and then
to eh no sorry my
and then basically then go up to ah so there's this
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
err
err expect a lot from the from us ah
standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
a'ah ya
and okay so you know how in
err they say oh okay err the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the one doing all this err
all these checks right correct
uh huh okay
so we also have the
we also had the schedule lah
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
err the one that we don't like lah
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about err the duty err is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
then
so this directing staff came down he was like oh err what time already I was like huh
what do you mean he's like err why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like huh
what you expect sia you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check ah
you get what I mean
ya lah
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check ah rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like ha
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
so we're like err when when I going it was like ah don't care already ah because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already ah
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies ah
um
okay okay
what you have done lah ha
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
oh don't have eh
okay then I guess err
mmhmm
okay lah but okay that

uh huh ha
oh
go into oh
okay
mm mm
oh
oh okay
a'ah
okay
mm mm
I see
ya
a'ah where is he
waliao eh
broke broke the stereotypes stereotypes
ah
no
uni changes people eh

okay testing
okay lah can lah
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of um hitting the red waves
yeah
ah but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements ah
take this as a the centre marking ah
so how was your prep
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like ah um what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but what what was the instructor's comments
mm
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money ah
it's the same bike
mm
E brake eh
oh okay okay ya ha ya it's there ah okay wait it was on the straight road
ya there's one mirror there
ya
mm
behind ah
oh okay
secluded ah
okay
um
of course lah
wait you went you you stop to help her
oh the instructor went to help her
ya lah I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
oh she
ya correct ya
mm
mm
what so she crashed into the wall
skid ah
by point of time you stop ah
mm
mmhmm
kill switch
mm mm mm mm mm
oh you get you got number one ah
mm
bandana
mm
mm
the other side ah
then
mm mm
mm mm
but he was in charge of your class ah
prac one also lah
oh okay
hmm
no lah maybe maybe they they want you to practise more ah before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no lah some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
class two ten seconds
okay lah I mean with practice you can ah
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already ha
that's how fast a class two bike is ah
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly ah
highly harly can bobber ah you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive lah sia uh I I I tested the bike um
I think last year during uh
so when they they they open up their their booth
people lah so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
whatever what you see is what you get lah
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
uh sanju
kaki bukit sanfu sanfu
uh and I think the
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven ah seventeen K
eh sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
four K
four plus ah
expensive ah
definitely way cheaper lah I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean uh zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike ah brixton
but of course lah mutt is mutt is
I mean way better lah
eh um if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
oh I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
uh brixton is is is a europe bike ah
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
um
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money ah
you upgrade
mm
ah lah of course lah of course lah
no lah I mean I'm looking at my options
why ah
ya but super four is uh quite reliable bike ah
it is
ya no problem
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
mm
but the one thing about super four
it's freaking expensive ah sial
my my bike one bottle that means one litre lah so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no lah one month ah I mean right now COVID one month ah
back then eh no lah back then when I was working in uh
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
that it took me about one month ah to to to reach two click two thousand click
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need ah
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay lah harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
four bottles of okay lah let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
motul uh ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs ah
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's why lah I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
like what
is it
it's nice lah I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
capacity
mm
oh
ya lah and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper ah
no the furthest I went with this bike was um desaru
the furthest I went with my was uh muar
ya ya lah
um
tow ah
they will go for the
the dangerous way ah
this one I I never tried ah I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you ah
so you've lift down your foot rest
my left leg
uh power to push together
ah
eh
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders ah
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or uh a new overhauled engine
um
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike lah
so this guy
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
jammed brake
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral lah
speaking of bike accidents
uh my father's friend ah
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga ah
eagle is it
and then I think he was riding an
so this the rider
my father witnessed his friend died lah sia
so so
before this guy died ah he told me lah then he was very different
eh you know forgive me ah if I ever sinned towards you ah
so on that day they went to
but same case ah he went under the truck
it's dangerous ah
oh speaking of dangerous riding kan I think one of their simulation lessons kan
they will simulate
you drunk
but it's damn stupid ah sial
no pass no fail
is just car just swerve in front of you
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can ah but then it's stupid ah
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike ah
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
can
but you will hold the bike ah no need no need no need
you driving in india is it
huh
he mounted the kerb in the mini circuit where is the kerb sia
that is far sia
mm
ya ya
huh
huh serious ah
oh the bike was lying on top
where were you
at the starting ah
he went home ah
it means quite quite bad lah
old guy ah
but big size ah
hazriq size ah
it but your class good
they they they there's this one small bike ah
I see that bike ah
alamak
what the guy is small or big
why sia why would he buy such a bike
no lah I mean if you scared I mean don't ride ah
maybe ah
but if you talk about those small bike ah
those those similar those kind of bikes ah
um there's this bike it's called uh honda monkey
but that bike is I I've seen this guy he he modelled his bike ah he'd turn that back into a chopper bike
like legit I had to bend down
because cafe racer is a racer is a racing bike
I mean for the olden days lah which is why it's it's called a cafe racer
so
I don't know ah
mm
go back to office ah
so you're gonna take you bikes ah
stupid eh
huh
you can book everyday
legit ah
oh
if got two days later
mm
mm
then you exceeded the line ah
oh exceeded the line means fail because if you are too fast also if you you stop in time they shouldn't be an issue ah
that was your last ah
assessment
fail ah
mm
mm mm
oh
mm
if there is a car you need to stop ah
ah
serious
mm
mm
bike instructor
ah serious ah
what if you hit into a car
who is the huh then the the damage all cover is it
mm
ya
no no no you have to okay so back then when I took a private kan the one I failed
so you will
as a start you will drive on the road
so it's
two point

chey

whoa
okay
I would ask for a a car
shoes
for anything any type of shoes I would want
so ya
so what about you akid
okay okay
you know what I mean
so ya
hmm
genie
genie the people who grant your wishes
genie
but I also think genie also have their own set of rules that you cannot ask for more wishes of these things what
you never know you know never know
the world is like super mysterious what
hmm
ah since I already have money right
but I only can ask for this much amount of money
so right if I want to buy shoes right
the money would confirm go down right
ah if I just for unlimited amount of shoes for any type of sports I want right
my money won't go down and I still have time for shoes what
so you get where I'm going from
for my love life I think
these two things already I think is already up there to get like
the girls I want not saying they're they're gold-diggers or anything but like
I'm saying that it would help me
a part to get girls lah like a love my love life to kickstart my love life I would say
so ya
so what so what
why you keep talking to me about your love life akid
what is wrong with your love life
because like you know err
you can't
hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
easy to say it's like it won't be good ah everything will just be everything oh I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate ah so like
so like you know ah sometimes right you need to think about
worth it ah
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life ah for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
ah
I mean everybody has their own opinion what
their own opinions in life
chey just joking but ya of course ah I want a pretty lady in my life and
uh show respect to my parents like that kind of girl ah
in that's what I look for in a girl ah
mm
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say lah like too playful ah
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she's a good mix in between ah like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall ah
but then turns out I'm not her type ah so if that that one I cannot do anything ah but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course ah every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus ah
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want ah I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
whoa
ah
process ah
process your morning
ah okay
a'ah
mm
it was just like out the blue ah
it was like your first relationship is it or
first date first first everything lah
it's like your first breakup ah you don't know how to handle lah
oh
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments what but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs what
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like oh this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated ah some would say
so ya
but then when she
labels ah I would say
mm
so you just became like a emotional guy ah
like you just needed like reasons ah like you want to solve it ah like you don't want to just breakup
like that ah
so like you try to you know talk to her lah but she didn't
she didn't like get back to you ah
she
move on ah so you just move on with your life
forget about her slowly
I mean if you're really lucky lah your first try you get
until to that state then you can marry that person then that's very good ah because like
so like ya lah
a'ah seh
in this world ah
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
a'ah
oh okay okay okay
so what did you leave her for someone
mm
mm
mm
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
mm
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings ah
ya
ah
ah
oh that's good that's good
ah to be honest ah
it depends on how the break up went ah
it's like
ya
so like
what's the point kan ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't ah
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends ah
do you still searching for love or anything
ah
oh
ah
ah okay
mmhmm
mm
eh
mm
ah
you just try to care for her lah like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares ah
ah
that's
that's a super hard question ah because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended ah
like
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on lah
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this one
were you still moving on
ya
mm
your second girl your ex lah
ah
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that ah
it's like something that is lost can never be found again ah
people say this one
so like ya
ugh
ya
totally not wrong
mm
in my in my relationships ah my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me ah I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like
there's stuff I did like I totally regret now ah like
imagine if I did I didn't do that in the past I would I might still be together with her now you know like
it's like of course ah I I I feel like sometimes I
you know I'm still young also like as you said like I'm still young also so like even you leave and you learn ah
so like ah
mm
it's like you just live ah like your future self think about that in the future ah I get what you mean
so like ya like you know ah
you always got to know ah sometimes it's not always your fault in the relationship ah so like
you know you always got to tell yourself
ah go the way you want it to then
sorry man
life is doesn't work in your favour all the time
mm
ah
like you know it's like don't think too much ah pretty much don't put ah

okay orh
ya for me today was okay ah
today today was my off day
of err leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave lah then
err I've been trying to clear so
then like um
today we had some random meeting
about err strength training like err for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water um
like the whole company lah from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to shanghai and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams lah but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test lah before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
mm it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
a bit
ya
ya a bit skewed err ya a bit skewed ah the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
err
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the shanghai branch and then ya we just shared lah then
I went first in that group and when I went first
I took like I think around three minutes lah let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy lah the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like oh err there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown lah to tell them to tell us that the break room is err going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of um shut down on the zoom orh
eh not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay lah not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
good to know lah when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
oh that sucks
mm do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure bo
sure bo
ah
huh
can like that meh
ya
then why you take
ah okay okay understand understand
ya seh
but ya uh
actually my last week was quite interesting ah
not interesting
but
err because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden err he joined the new shift lah
ya my three shift correct
so it like his first day was just me and him
oh no that day he that day
me and jaden
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do err
what was that err had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me eh just tomorrow
err tomorrow what's that ah oh tomorrow
I may not be able to oh no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was ah mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us eh on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge lah on that day
no it's not a big deal lah that job it's just
someone to be um
someone to be who's who will answer to the client lah
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like eh just I think err
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay lah why then he said oh because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad lah
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
I don't know lah I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt lah
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
err okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay lah I told him okay lah then go ahead lah you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day ah then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
um
wah damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not lah but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
um we are now separated into clients ya
oh cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know lah
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day lah because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like eh wait wait wait ah walao walao
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss lah I feel bad
um hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
err I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
eh no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day ah
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working lah
ya eh on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
oh you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve eh twelve thirty
then now it's like err three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
eh for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya lor so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
uh yes but then
um I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes uh
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult uh
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
I'm
my sleep is deprived
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
mm
it's like
if I were to sleep in kan that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team lah at least they are
they are not big fans of
um
this client
this huh
yes but
you can always learn uh you know what I mean
and it's a job ah you are getting paid
plus
ya
you just learn ah you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people uh because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good lah I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
like this current shift that I'm on lah I've been too complacent
um
I don't know I I just I
what's the word ah complacent uh when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like whoa like you know about this like
like oh because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers lah
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it uh
like last month or what then I realised oh shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference ah
whether they
can work with you or not ah like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
reserve
ya
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this um
this file
then like
um from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines lah like what are the headlines for today so
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines lah ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like oh I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it uh when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
mm
often time
but now
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
jaded ya
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
mm
wow
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
no
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
this whatever can pick up
people
mm
mmhmm
it's too loud
okay
okay
mm
ya lah
no but I just
kind of conversation
oh so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay lah I think it is their job lah
a'ah lah
weeb
weeb do you have that in the dictionary weeb
weeaboo
I don't think so please don't
maybe don't ya maybe don't
mmhmm
I don't know is it new
what is it about
mmhmm
okay
don't spoil don't spoil don't spoil for me
ya don't spoil
okay
two seasons
I think there was one there was a few ah kan was there one that you were looking forward to
right

of movies you know what I mean
to
no no like how they distribute movies overseas in this time you know like do they send the film over is there someone who comes
hilarious
films ah
projector lor
I think that's I think so
probably ah they probably don't live up to the name now probably it's expensive
I think I think projector is the closest we can find to that ah
artefacts like
mm
ya the effect lah but
that's the beauty of it
mm
the actual thing
ya ya
correct correct
ya
yes
mmhmm
okay
that's the maximum resolution ah
mm
four K two thousands

E R ya something like that auteur yes so like they have their own style of so it's like
christopher nolan or whatever you know what I'm saying
Gong Cha
Gong Cha
okay
okay
mm
okay but okay can but filming is very um it's a very
flexible
project
in terms of you have to be able to be flexible if things don't work out
so if let's say you will have like you said you had a certain shot in mind right
sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your
ya manage your expectations ah
to get that shot you know what I'm saying
calm down
mm
ya lah
yes
yes
ya be a
be a realistic director and a writer
english
mix also can
what kind of themes would you want to input in like the movies that you make
mmhmm
to your brain ya
mmhmm
type of genre right
twist ya
age
understand
mm
what's a movie that you think
psychologically was it like
stimulating for you
mmhmm
okay
ya the one with the natalie portman
mm
mmhmm
uh huh
ya ya ya
but it's not very is it psychological though
it's very it's more nostalgia now
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
yup
ya
ya
mmhmm
yup
changed
and they played around with the splicing and all that
kind of put it upon themselves also what
mm
a'ah
ya
a'ah
mmhmm
and the
ya
okay what other movies
the wailing yes yes yes yes yes definitely
correct
ya
yes
a'ah seh
oh
correct ya right
mm it's every it's all the things that I appreciate in films put together and like whoa I was so surprised eh
do the people that you know now are they like
who are they you know what I mean make me make me question my current relationships with like people that I know like my family even are they the people they are
ya sia
exactly
wah you know when he went through the house
was he supposed to or was he not supposed to
like you know how they say like the
I hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
like the family will die or something like that right so he went through right
but was he supposed to or not
I forgot about that
a'ah
mm
ya
mm mm
ya
mm
you're also insignificant
correct correct
mm
uh then who did I watch with
this indonesian woman
uh can watch online if you want eh you want to watch today
ya
why
mm
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that one will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know ah movies are
just tough stuff ah because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
mmhmm
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
wah
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this uh you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by blah blah blah
mm
mm
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see ah
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
ah okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
ah but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also what
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay lah not that bad
han orh
why
okay
okay
mm
mm understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
mm I try play on Borderland lor
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
mm
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things eh like ugh
things for speedy for my cat
um
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else ah
oh I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought um
to for the mugen train I bought the demon slayer masks
I I I I I only want one which is the
nezuko one
I ordered four
of course lah but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
mmhmm
ya
adli's watching
ya
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
I feel like when everybody watches it
the special
ya
ya
uh huh
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible uh that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also ah because like
thankfully
due to the
or haikyu maybe it's gotten quite popular
it's so easy to find
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
mm
a'ah
mm
ya so that's what I'm talking about ah
hard to be a fan when they're not very
ya
mm
so like
okay understand
mmhmm
okay
oh
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
um because I don't know ah it's different ah it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
err
she's very she's very quiet lah but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun uh
how about japanese content how are they like then she's oh she doesn't actually watch a lot
there are not
as many well known
um
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
ya real dramas
um
it's not as popular lah in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so oh I just do writing because she does err makeup
like uh she studies
err what's that called cosmetics I think
um I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore lah that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
then she said oh she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it lah then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
um like during high school and all that
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian one lah because
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID ah
jakarta
ya lah
but she used to live in yoyga also yogyakarta
very nice ah they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different lah what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
ah I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
uh huh
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
kidding
um
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so um I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
in the thousands so like
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like um
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids what
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya koreaboo
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
wah I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online lah because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
um I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like wow and like it's hundred and four eh
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it um
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech eh
say it's for Logitech

for lunch
so expensive

okay lah the feels to eat satay is there

like we exchanged stories lah and then turns out that he has been asking around
and then like he has never bought his own pack of cigarettes which is like weird
oh no

wah grabhitch eh
very lucky
ya grabhitch very rare you know people get grabhitch
I mean I feel like it depends on your luck what because like let's say the driver is going wherever you're going
and then the driver happens to be in the same area as you
then you will get it what
mm
ah okay lah
mm mm
wah
mm mm
mm
mm
az
people say
don't cry over spilled milk tau
for my birthday but then we cannot go bali right so I want to eat indonesian food
mm
okay lah that's like
soon in six days
but we need to
save some money for dinner lah if you want to plan for dinner
mm
do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself lah in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
speak
mm
no okay do you even okay maybe you do lah but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows
ya
mm
mm
I think we grew up differently lah
ah
I wanted to watch a movie because it's been a while since we I don't know about you it's been a while since I last watched a movie and then
uh wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
eh wonder woman seh
that's the villain lah for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan seh to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
it's gonna be so
mm mm
money makes the world go round eh
ya lah
but
mm
uh maybe we do something different lah you know that they have this like
you know those uh escape rooms
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual reality
world ah through the eyes
ya anyways those uh virtual reality rooms ya we can consider doing that I think
I think it's about
forty five minutes ah
okay lah if you calculate it's like one minute one dollar
you have to accommodate to um all the group who you know that uh not all our friends like to LAN right
mm mm
but the future is bleak right now bro
that's why we are balanced
hais
eh
mm mm
and then my next pay probably is twenty twenty one
new year new me wah
um
ya
so
huh that's a I think this topic of like what to eat
it's like
a deep dark hole you know
because like
so much difficulties thinking about what to eat
what to eat nevermind you you need to think about whether you want to order in and then like there's the delivery fee and all that to consider
context of
having the difficulty to
choose what to eat
mmhmm
catching
mm
okay
so
ya
wah wah wah wah wah
ya lah because twenty dollars divide by six people
mm
too emotional sometimes
it's true
hmm
okay lah
I mean it's just like to some people
and
the booking for the staycation
wait so need to let them know lah tomorrow morning
no because we never talk about when to tell them
so we need to let them know tomorrow morning when we wake up on the way to work
eh just message the group lah we have a group
ah
wait is it
I was looking at the furnitures lah to like maybe buy I don't know I haven't make any decisions yet
but have you seen the loft bed
the linie loft bed
I mean ya the our website lah bedandbasics our company website then after that I was looking at this linie loft bed
and then I mean the price is on the higher end
but the bed looks so good the black one
wasted
why
the what
what promotion
how much was the promotion
huh spend six hundred wait wait wait wait wait spend six hundred dollars get fifty dollars off you can use on the spot
so that's five hundred fifty lah
but okay that doesn't matter ah
because I didn't have money back then so
but ya now I have money and I'm looking at the furniture and the furniture looks good the black colour one
like
the the I don't know lah maybe it was the picture the the whole aesthetic of it with the and the nift loft bed
ya I'm living for that like
I want that kind of
design now in my room
because
I would from the from the plant by the side
I want it there also
I mean the can be different lah
because I wanna buy a better brand better quality
then buy like a a sofa bed and then like that will be used as a sofa
ya
I've seen the reviews
and like
on all the
e-commerce or like startups from like bloggers vloggers or whatever
a lot of them give good reviews
and another one was the
ah LUMOS aura projector
and then ah projector
ya and I but because like I don't know I can't decide whether I wanna buy a or the projector
I don't know because like there's pros and cons for both
because let's say if I move out with a projector is easier
then with a it's more bulkier but then if I want to play games or anything
like
cause ya lah
ah adulting is so hard sometimes you know
ya
so
I don't know
mmhmm
uh huh
kan I also had that concept
money is a big factor
can you imagine we find the you know there was this mouse hunt recently
the ten thousand dollars mouse hunt by the squeaky uh
ah the concept is like that you find
the winner who the winner who finds it will get ten thousand dollars
can you imagine the amount of money
and then we still have spare
we can uh I mean
divide lah the money then I would probably wanna buy like a a new laptop
for school
mm mm
alhamduls
mm all the best for that
like that's the thing about humans lah
when you get extra
complain when you get shortage complain it's like our culture
hais
I would prefer to spend that money on food then on grab
ya lah
kan the first few music we won't be sleeping also
cause like we will get comfortable
what lah you don't want to watch like this
mm
so come come up with a new idea eh
munch nibble on something
it's cool
thick and juicy
a'ah
mm mm

okay
okay
huh
ah
that's why
ah
rapatkan sangat kecuali pasal waktu kerja
mm
mm
we need to have a balance of our life and work wait work commitments from time to time
consider of uh finding something else lah like what you have done which is good
we have to be answerable for our own actions
same like when you go to your new work place you have this kind of situation whereby politics comes in
ah consistency how you want to keep your consistent ah status
making sure that whatever you have done
ah you do it you must know what you are doing you cannot affort to just like ah do something without knowing what you are doing correct ah
kevin you remember kevin from covalent aircon eh kevin
yes correct ah you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
huh
ah so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
you want english you want malay you want english or malay or you want korean
do they have muslim in korea
tomorrow they are coming down right to see the exhaust thing lah correct tomorrow you follow me lah help me eleven to eleven thirty
that one we settle first then number two right ah
I will bring him to see victoria you know that same place victoria
so you can assure victoria that you are also come down and check your due diligence
we left already fiona told me eh rasyidi you say wrongly this one not by landlord this one by tenant tenant tenant tenant
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain
the faulty full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost lah
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including for right correct
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very ah
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
later I show you ah the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means ah
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
people will go there just to buy food and go away ah and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs lah
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
no the you mean the cement eh
the cement will be the second half of the unit what second half
it means it's not the for the front tau the front will be rental it would not go up huh
maybe they have to put some
they can go to the level one toilet
mm so
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
ah a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that oh the sprinkler worse ah don't need do submission
her consultancy ah the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
you do modification you need to do submission to correct
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
ah to but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct
ah
ah
and I think this this few days I will shoot invite to all the
they got cash flow problem
if there's an issue then they share with us it's good for us to know correct ah of course they can deny lah but of course you you know their problem
oh actually I will get my specialist to contact you okay fine
at least there's some progress tau
ah next week monday kan
and you can undergo a unit where a haggard ah then I'm going to my muscular that gotten my email and
if they want to do seventeen to be orientation then we let them do
no need to rush to rush ah we just tell them okay this is the powerpoint
this is the ah rooftop what key we going to draw out right right
ah so far so far ah so far I I have not seen them doing that
correct so safety aspect they may want us to provide them a a more secure ladder which I will get lye to quote lah
I I I think ah the new ladder doesn't matter lah correct justifiable correct
because they are our term so they need to access quarterly or as and when
nevermind boss you can smile until tomorrow boss but my appraisal boss
because eh side staff have their own issue so the of the side staff
rasyidi has done a good job for the past one year then he has okay supportive and then the tenancy like him
okay we give him this grade okay good okay damian I accept okay
no not can disturb know nobody can disturb know

err you still go to McDonald's or wait for samurai burger
or any of the shaker fries

okay maybe I will
but
in suria
um I don't know if you watched but is a classic drama is a local
uh show
made by suria
no lah uh I'm glad that
Netflix
watch any movie anytime anywhere
uh and you also
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite uh show or anime
so now
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
um
eh um
sorry
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
then uh maybe
grades
and um
uh
so when do you graduate
two years
um
I only left with
four months
um then after four months
then
um just
work
then uh if there's
uh school school uh if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
so it's best for me to work
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about uh
uh money anymore
I
okay with
because uh
but ya
good that uh I have a friend like you
err that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
join rugby
so I've
played rugby
ya so
rugby err
is with me since uh secondary school
and now I'm in a uh club
uh tamoko lions
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
I can see on my uh
meets
ya
uh I recently got injured because of my bad leg
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that uh nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
orh
um when I was young I like extreme sport
um
err then uh
secondary school I go to
err
skatepark and I like skateboarding
uh hopefully that
um
speaking of commitments uh I think
err
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
um I think
they are having confusion about phase three
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
you know how terrible that is
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably err go out in an adventure
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news ah fake news
so uh I really want to go karaoke with my friends ah
and for my girlfriend uh probably go out on a date
somewhere uh and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
oh
uh anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
oh ya um actually
err go staycation at least
I have never been before so at least
oh uh
um
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go sentosa
uh go beach with my family and
and uh you know swim
um I'm not afraid of heights
are you
um
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
um I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube err like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
drifting
and
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
uh I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
err when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
um my favourite car is
uh
uh
uh is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
um
my favourite car is mostly uh japanese
for example uh Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
um
tokyo drift is one of them
ah actually
but I only watch till
and I watch uh
way before ah
uh nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because uh he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
err like twenty years
in fact that
support the same club
man united shirt
um
and uh the manager himself that uh brought man untied to win uh
twenty titles
man U
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
uh they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win uh all the uh season
and err what I heard recently
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
while man U have already won twenty times
if
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
uh probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya uh um
mm
ya I also
err
go back into the normal state lah
and everybody starts to work normally and uh uh
ya
stick to the uh rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so
we just need to
move on
and pray for the best

one
oh nevermind lah
oh no lah I was just looking at the jurassic mile
um
I think track in changi airport
today or some some some time maybe I I dah
err is it sedap mania or something quite cheap right if I'm not wrong
err
have have they got those suggest sliced beef
ya
a'ah
ya
so
ya
hafizah
most likely ah

but lucky got sinopec lah
anyway
dining in the garden ang mo kio ah

so far
in the future
so

so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits lah
so what do you think how about you
huh serious
ya lah ya lah
ah
alcohol
things that
are not allowed lah in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead lah with it
segregate your assets lah so I think one good err platform to that we can use is
I as far as I know this is the
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
uh
um and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
uh forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
oh okay so like
err ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge lah then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside lah of of using
wahed invest
um
how to say eh
what err things you have to face lah if you want to go through the halal way
ya so you have to put up lah with this all these service charge lah when these banks
new way
true
do it the halal way then it's the best lah
ah correct
a'ah deep
ya correct lah I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
okay lah ya
jalan kayu ah
I okay
ya correct
oh
ya that's why
I mean good lah good I mean next time next time we go we should try lah

it is much more err not it's much more harder like much more thinking to do because it's a lot more roles like among us is
err you just come
mayor lah then like also same same thing like
there the town will like discuss on who is the
ya that's quite cool that's why but it's a it's a quite old game ah
but if we're in town of salem this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say I'm good at the game lah but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore
ya something like that lah but you have to survive ah basically their task is to survive ya lah like among us
ya not one impostor like
like mafia mafias like got your three people together
did you watch this err youtube

you know got the footlocker one the wah the
cause
okay lah true true true

uh huh err
yo but actually duh wah okay so you got anything you want to say before we end sir darwin
there are like thirty seconds left
ah hopefully ah inshaallah amin
okay lah but it's
and I mean it is has been like
it's been very natural right we do it as natural as we can right
it's not it's not scripted or anything for real though it's just

okay
that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better lah
like I know the outro was a bit okay lah
a bit better
because the outro previously was like meh
ya
now I think intro okay lah still what my second second video
so
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that one eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together uh then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade ah
saw online like two hundred fifty sia for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it ah sia
just buy ah
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade lah as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five eh the new Ryzen four gen four eh gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
wow
then what they release it as
the fuck sia
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him lah
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company lah I guess
but okay lah it all worked out for them
free money sia
ya
Sony is terrible sia you know they don't allow discord on five I'm like what the fuck sia
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users
ya ya it's terrible eh
no the the thing is I'm like okay if you have a four chat you know but then now a lot of games support cross play and then you like
and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first one that was like quite good sia
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least
ya
of course uh I mean I took awhile before I went to discord
whatever it is better than Razer comms man Razer comms was shit man

it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya lah
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like siao lah
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage eh only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck ah
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
ya
the because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money ah then then but but that is unlikely ah
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like ah you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late ah can got late payment ah
but there's no interest lah
ya
you know the new borat movie coming out soon borat
and then there's this video of uh donald trump's lawyer rudy giuliani
so the thing is right he was ah asked to come to the bed ah the hotel room of the borat borat two got borat and his daughter I think
so the daughter of borat supposedly lah ask him to come to the room and shit lah
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever lah so then he put borat put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
ah so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room ah then he was in the room ah then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the borat came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen ah she was twenty four lah but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is oh he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet ah but a few people in the media industry watched it ah like I because borat does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week lah next week monday most likely the video goes public ah
ah no they he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad ah
borat does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer ah the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video sia come on guys
no ah they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
why
why sia
haiya they I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
taiwan ah
the missile lah
taiwan ah
this is how countries do diplomacy lah
same like north korea what
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions lah it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over taiwan then it says taiwan wasn't theirs in the first place
the only sad part is actually taiwan defeated not defeated lah kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
because china is
ya ya taiwan isn't listed as a country of the because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china and a few other countries
republic of taiwan no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news ah
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between taiwan and singapore is that we are not under another country
ha ha ha ha ha ha
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean hey are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like eh eh boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't have you seen the video
and then now cannot go back home
ah so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because lockdown back
then I was like uh
oh okay
why ah then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think sabah had err election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like oh that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread lah I guess
I don't know lah difficult lah the policies they have also not very strong so
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to lor
to like buy stuff buy fuel
a'ah sia
eh come on ah it's one third the price bro that means eh I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time ah jer per week sia that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only sia instead of times three ah two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time mah you travel there ah
every month eh
but okay lah takes a lot of time ah I personally don't do it because
jam ah
always jam
and then the closest one near tuas and then tuas you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
but okay what ah now got the discount what twenty percent sia for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is ah if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions lah okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight ah I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line
fuck you lah no
no you can just clear the thing don't let anyone bang and just leave it that's why you're not a politician okay or saving the earth the earth would be dead if you are saving it
ha ha ha
no expediting the process is donald trump man
very sad like he worked eight years sia for that would fight against the congress
you know and then all went to shit
just like that
not not not one person it took a whole nation to vote him
it took no it took a whole nation not to vote for hillary that was it
I'm like sial ah you all talk about emails ivanka also got emails what then no one cares only
don't know lah
then he then got mention what I remembered trump recently mentioned like if he lose the election he's going to run away from the country
cause he say he be embarrassed for losing all you know why or not he's going to run you know why
as it
he know if he come back he's going to sit in jail for very very very long
because I I bet you joe biden will try his best sia to do it
who
who
on fucking twitter of all the places them really ah guess how he want the millennium will vote eight years back in that they are few politicians who was actively like in social media ya that's
I mean because obama is acting on twitter eh bro
ya
now he still now he still
and first ladies ah
like melania trump nobody cares ah
ya I mean I I don't really care about the opinion of the country that voted trump up you know
I'm I uh I really don't care
who
valkrae
oh ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya alexandria ocasio-cortez ya she she was the highest the most viewed stream on twitch sia the most viewed stream I was like oh wow but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really sia she's really good sia and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan eh like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also ah bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say ah aggressive a lot of people don't like her
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like oh she's too progressive
oh err reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering lah begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
is one point two K every week eh
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same ah it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything ah he's not gonna like oh let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
oh my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like ah the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct oh my god I was like ugh and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
world sia
never right
kan ah
any proof ah I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview ah like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things ah
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation lah the questions ah then after that he got
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes ah like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
kan
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible ah
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible ah that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
so how how's your job you know like ah do you believe like trump's economy will pick up and then why while this guy's there and it's like
making economy great my business is booming and then he's asking like what what business are you in you know what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lending
his business booms when the economy goes down what
so I think then the guy like just laugh he just cannot stop then the guy is like I'm voting for trump then he like laugh again
it's like holy shit man it's like aww man these are the kind of voters that vote for trump because for them selfishly their business like when the economy is like the same what when somethings go down right when there's a down turn someone earns what it's not like everyone will lose equally
so like this kind of people earn ah like this moneylenders
like other crap lah that happens
like the obviously the ones that go down like like grab riders because COVID and all these shit transport
you know public transport and shit
all the same ah
but like this ah
public transport ridership reduced what
by ridership reduce then the
ya I mean as a general the drivers don't care but as the company you would suffer losses lah
at the end of the day is still a government agents like it's not agencies like it's like ya is a it is govern by the government lah so for them they not really like going to take the hit that hard lah
they are not going to closed down and the like oh no more public transport for singapore
ya but
ya sia
oh
period who go out not a lot sia
ya
work essential service not relays
but sad ah sad some of the really but lucky they got some subsidies and like you know
they had
not all lah
ya rental ah
two months I think two months I think
ah
my my neighbour taxi driver
he say ah work then he earn the pay the fuel then the rest of the money I keep then okay he camps around ah airport you know
because they don't have to pay rent
ya
just wait ah
ya
just wait
medisave right
difficult ah
ya difficult difficult
he just camp your house lah
next time you see him
you say him eh you camper
ya lah
ya lah
ya
ya
ya
but rarely lah
like ten minute wait lah
okay ah
I mean
shopping centre ah
huh then what the fuck sia
call pe
fuck
ya
I think confirm sleep
happens ah happens I got that time delivery also I got do at home right
but mine is collecting food so it's not not really at most you just come
at most I just come I I that time usually I I deliver one hour sia
after I get the order
I wake up then like slowly go to the bike
the thing is the person is waiting at home it doesn't matter
then the food the food doesn't they don't care how long they wait they don't have a say in it ah ah most to most the customer complain
most of the time they won't ah they might but so far my experience is no
then you chao
ya
but
ha ha ha ha ha ha
woke up into what about currently
you got burned bro
so he wanted the guy come down then was like I'm gonna eat your pizza mate you gotta come down here I'm gonna I'm gonna eat right here
ya
actually by right if got staircase then we cannot deliver up sometime a bit nonsense one
like
if it's like if you allow like like go up staircase like if it's one two floors is fine then if it's more than what if it's an old guy kind of like a bit busted to him also eh
ya that's the thing ah then it's like busted what then you have to come down it it protects riders more ah
if there's a lift you really got really no excuse ah
buildings don't have
I hate sia that one and then usually right the people who order live on the fifth floor
fucking assholes man
and then don't want come down
don't want
send to my door
yup
but it is what it is
it is what it is
wah sial lah that one I remember sia
that was the worst I didn't go supermarket
I was like fuck that shit
I guess sceptical help lah
ya
I remember during that period I went like
at like two to the grocery store
because no one is awake right
so it's like lesser people to fight with
but then the thing
they restocking around that period as well
ya
then got nothing for you
ya
ya
that's why ah
no lah mine got more mine got three or four three or four no mine cause it's twenty four hours
but mine they do the restocking at that time so cannot be two person what
the store quite big sia mine
it's not like like the one here the here is kind of linear what mine is like a weird shape so there's a bit of blind spot that the cashier cannot see
so they're going to have to have have two people cause one station at one area
ya
ah ya
ya that's the thing ah
ah okay
put the money then go jer
ha ha ha ha
scan yourself you know like
then you just go fuck off
okay what
ya what you doing ah what you doing I'm paying for my own groceries
why never ring the bell cause I lazy bro
the starting lah
one point five
no the thing is singapore water can drink sia the tap
and COVID is not waterborne
it was proven not to be waterborne that's why they said swimming pools were safe
ya I guess I guess so
but there is still ah you know
not all ah but a lot of them ah
oh ya
which is
that's why ah WhatsApp group dangerous
all this fake news
I I never really like
like some people just join sia random WhatsApp group you know like
the fuck sia
I don't know that's the thing
it doesn't make sense
but I guess that's where like they get their info that's the thing ah the info not verified also
I can just send some random shit that I made
one thing at least singapore give free mask okay ah
I feel the free mask initiative was quite good
two time oh ya ya ya okay ah not bad

ah alright okay so
you know how we started on sixteen
then after that
ah it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so uh
set of tactics to use and gegenpress tiki-taka all all pre-default
okay but then
mm so there's more tactical freedom lah in that sense
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever lah so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then ah
four two three one
so there is no restrictions on that however
kan
uh
mm
mm
yes
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything kan this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
ah
so
mm
I have yet to check spanish league
belgian I think belgian league don't have then err
all those minor minor small small leagues lah
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game lah yesterday lah I mean
I tried a few clubs ah yesterday like err dortmund
then I switch over to uh chelsea then I switch over again to zagreb then switch over now I'm back at dortmund
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to lah
was four years orh
that's four years difference you know
siol
sixteen will be come out fifteen pe ah
uh
by right they should be launching in september october lah but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so err
twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
ah so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first ah
at the end of day it's free pe if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one pe
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
still can be able to run sixteen so I feel like it should be fine ah
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot lah cause graphic is very very minimal
should be no issue ah
it's quite big ah
okay
I think should be no issue already lah cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
very very detailed
outliers
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
ah
so they add a psychological concept to the game tau
so then your core players kan the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything kan
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
ah
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game ah
no cause
okay you see eh it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest tau
ah
ah then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my dortmund case is
hummels was from bayern pe
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
ah you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
mm
mmhmm
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club lah
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new pe even though he's old
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat barcelona five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during barcelona eight two defeat to bayern munich
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team lah
mm
mmhmm
mm
no no no no no no
cause you already technically purchase for it already
mm
but then let's say you have uh twenty on your steam account okay
your twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam uh epic games account
you can you can try ah I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow lah cause
it's quite a big game lah but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me lah
ah seriously
oh K K K K
okay ah then those things do not need high internet speed everything
ah then I don't think that one can run lah
ah
internal cleaning tau
there's a few things that affect your your computer speed lah so dust is one thing
and then after that uh the make and model if it's outdated then
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst lah I mean
so it's very
it's quite intensive lah ah ha
eh eh
ya in a sense ah
oh okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again lah to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on kan so
in this version was the medical centre
ah so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot lah I haven't really jump into medical centre yet lah you can explore it later ah
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker eh whoa that would be damn good
oh you just press play play play play for ages siol
oh ya there is a singapore league inside ah ya
ah you
I mean this is a precedented situation pe
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle lah I mean ah like like there's one club
in twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
half your squad missing ah
ah
all the north ah
even the north south are not semi-pro tau
they are pro you know
fall from grace ah I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off ah their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with ah cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end lah cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
ah crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so you end up still going down pe
mm
it depends lah cause
unless you
liquidate the club ah
unless you dissolve the club ah
no
I buy over your club
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated kan cause of the financial fair play rules uh you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K pe just nice your club will stay afloat
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue ah
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down ah until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial ah
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
so they face financial difficulties they were in serie ah
okay serie A
ah
ha
third corruption
okay so what did club did was ah they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
ah to stay afloat lah so uh what juventus did was juventus pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
ah then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again ah
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing ah
but it is possible ah like clubs like
wimbledon wimbledon ah that is a new club by itself
cause they split from dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this ah where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues lah I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this lah
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this ah err one particular example I know is dons ah
dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then ah
english
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
I mean
look look at our situation
you used to lah still am lah so it's a difference
definitely ah I mean look at your size
ya lah it's cause
no lah maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile pe
ya lah so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change lah
I
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal kan before the pandemic situation ah then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
okay so imagine the players charging towards you eh running with the ball and everything
idea kan
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least tau
no lah I mean
at the end of the day
solid sia
I forgot which year that was lah err
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten ah around there lah
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so ah every other party kan
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight suria and the vasantham channel so uh every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the
all across all four channels lee hsien loong face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him ah
it was a thirty minutes speech
ya I mean
no lah I mean okay you see eh for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation eh for our generation ah at the most ah
our first language is usually english
quite solid
okay it's
so these are the kids where
their the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
so obviously you only remember your first language pe cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
english ah cause
that's the language that we are used to
from but you said in ah
probably ah babe
I don't think it's depending on ah your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in lah
language that you use most often cause let's say kan
ah so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english ah okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language pe english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english pe
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a this is the language they use everyday
I mean at the end of day also
he will do one
okay but
I mean
eleven or eight eleven or eight ah screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down pe it's better than coming up kan the stairs kan okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
ah thank god
I can tell lah I mean
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a ah
a cycle to work to look forward to lah everyday lah but now is just
I mean
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside lah
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
haiya
it's a shame ah
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
whoa
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere kan
mm so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different pe everyday you have to use your vessel
mm
no ah
it's still quite low lah but it's not
that low also lah I mean
car oil and uh jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference ah
from how many litres to how many of litres ah so
no lah that one
it really depends on current situation ah I mean
as of now damn slow ah
to pick up ah
honestly this situation is worst when corona ah worst than SARS pe
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently government
ban the postal service from sending masks to every household in america
ah so then the
this this lady was saying wah this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello ah seh they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing lah so I
think logically lah I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with

oh
ya it was a skillsfuture fund ah ya
mm
err I mean ya lah I mean ah when I was with
with my uncle at my uncle's shop right
uh start to
ya still one year ya so total is one year lah plus
the the barber life ah barber life is um
quite unhealthy lah you smoke then you drink sugary drinks sweet drinks then
wait about customer then you got customer then you will cut your hair wait then cut their hair then after that
um audio audio engineering job lah because
eh but but honestly singapore
all most of the position are taken taken up already and now because like like
like this situation like COVID situation
there's not many uh studio recording jobs lah so unless you're really lucky then you get a studio where
you know they need somebody to intern or something then you will
you will get the job lah if not
you it's quite difficult to find find a audio engineering job lah
studio engineer job lah like recording engineer job inside the studio lah
err there's a lot of jobs like that but it's tiring lah ya that one every week you can get that kind of job just that it's
it's tiring lah but the the real job that I really want is to
to record for artist inside the studio lah that one I really have to find lah ya
err lah universal music and all that lah so a lot of those jobs are take up already so
err mediacorp lah mediacorp suria maybe suria but I I'm also quite sure there's already a
there's already an audio audio main audio person there main audio engineer there

pbb err ya lah I mean now
ya ya nothing nothing much to look forward to
nowadays lah like I I really want to travel lah I really want to save money and
and travel lah so ya lah a lot a lot you cannot do a lot of things right now lah
mm you know during COVID so
ya so all I can do is is find job right now ah the the last
they're talking about talking about my uh barbering job and all that I
I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that lah so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought um monday since since uh like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay lah the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night lah night shift like I can work from eleven to
err eleven to I think
seven ah seven seven eleven near
near my house lah near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny leh I I didn't
I didn't get a reply ah they didn't reply me it's actually
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get seh I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job kan
ah yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're err ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so ah it's easy for me to
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier lah so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which uh which location you prefer
then
huh
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
now I'm waiting for another call lah then they so far never call they're taking quite some time ah I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true lah true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that err right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that um
some people are not really serious about the job lah they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point lah so
that's what my mother said lah then I I think I think quite
true lah like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
err I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they ah um
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
err diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary lah a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs lah so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya lah of course lah I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like um if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time lah I will I will do mm
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently lah I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up lah definitely like um
ya getting easily more tired or you know like um
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different lah when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like um oh I'm the best I can do
oh I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
um you realize
you're not really the best ah other people better than you or then you
you start to ya lah it's a different thing lah
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also lah different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya lah different different privileges
yes
correct lah actually actually true lah I I
ah I know I mean the the the thing is that because err right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk lah I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
ah nicely have respect for elders but
huh I don't know about the the the the current um I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all lah some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have um respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job lah teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
they know how to talk to to
older people lah so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them lah like um
like old old people old values lah old values like like um
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know
ya but some some are different some are like really they
ya they
you know ya but it's all ya lah it's it's all a small thing lah at the moment mm ya
mm
maybe ah because I got oily face or what then in the morning
in the morning I if I don't if I don't shower or what then I
you know my face will be very oily or what that kind of thing then that one will
okay lah that kind of thing but maybe maybe maybe
I don't know whether it's a
mm
pass very fast lah for me so
so a'ah lah
was more relaxed lah more
laid back chill ya
so um
COVID I mean
mm
apocalypse no lah
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing ah nothing much lah
I I was just trying to get along earn money lah you know ya
ya
oh okay okay okay ya the first the very first um
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one lah phase one circuit breaker was
was ya lah it's a bit a bit um
a bit stressful lah stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
oh circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like ah I I don't care lah I will still go out lah I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that lah I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing lah then I I
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing lah so it's not like
just go out you know like
um
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also lah
ya
weird lah you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly um
hmm
mm
ya mm definitely different
different time lah you know err nobody
nobody expected this to happen lah so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed lah that time they a lot of people stressed err a lot of uh
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry lah then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct mm
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs eh actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like tampines interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from tampines interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like um
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
err cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot uh like harder
times lah a lot of people going through like more hardship lah you know that
if you think you are like
quite sometimes I feel quite um
I just feel quite sad lah sometimes when I see all this lah ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced lah forced to
forced to stop working and
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
ya but anyway like um
mm
mmhmm
wherever lah
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business ah catering business they do sell
ya then it's not only that lah uh basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped lah then no cannot get money lah music business
so the next thing that
err like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies lah video
I mean um
right now video is doing
more important lah video is doing well lah like ya um
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a err uh to make a content right so
are out there lah there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
oh I if had taken a video err course or what then
mm
is like lessons from home all zoom zoom lessons from home right so
like what am I going to do since next time like if if the if this thing continue then
ya itu lah funny times lah right now it's the funny funny times
ya
oh okay okay ya ya ya
oh ya ah
ya ah
mm
be part of this movement lah
oh ya ya ya okay okay
they put on netflix already like all the jack neo movies all the
old uh like money no enough like um
I not stupid and all that like ah boys to men
all the old movies ah mee pok man twelve storeys
oh is it
phua chu kang um under one roof everything is on netflix ah right now then I was like
ya so like lately I mean err you know there was um there was um
singapore music scene where you know all the like sony rivals the band like they have
their songs on like movie soundtracks like like twelves storeys ah mee pok man all that right then
ya so I finally get to watch all those movies lah ya I ah that's what I've been doing lah all the nights actually
ya catch up on my on all all the old things that I've missed last time like like uh when
during the nineties era what happened right like music scenes in singapore
so through movies lah then I I I I I watch lah that's that's what I've been catching up on lah actually ya
ya

okay ah okay
okay
mm mm mm
okay okay
okay
okay lah full name mohammad haikal bin hasani can just call me haikal lah so err
actually what what I had planned for this year was
okay
I was in the I was doing err project management in their construction line lah
ah
yes
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response lah
and the
ah ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times lah so
then err
err when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
it was just a job for me
uh it's just a job for me to pay the bills lah
and ah just to
to to to earn to earn money lah
most of them they further their studies
ah
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay ah just go go go ahead with it
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree uh which
is related to my work lah so err maybe err err few years down the road err
down my career path lah in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
oh okay err I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up uh civil engineering ya ah
err
it it it
err
it's related lah but
uh not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the err engineering aspect ah it's more to the project management side
it was just like ah
ya
so ah
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now lah
even before during my poly I went for my err internship
so it was during my internship that that made me err think twice to to join the construction industry
err it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
ah
the working hours the nature of the work uh the work environment
err err ya
err
just sharing my my my experiences lah
okay okay mm
ya they attach me to a local construction company
err so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries lah or you can see a big difference between a local company and err err foreign or multinational company lah
I err in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that lah so I was attached to a local construction company lah
ah the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a ah
a
everyone in the office was so busy with their work
acknowledge
in their office ya that was that was how I felt lah
it's a it's a foreigner I think ah he he's an indian guy
and because you can speak well so they they they they put him as an office boy
ah
so ah
he was the first guy who acknowledged me
ah
abeh ah
the project manager err then the project manager
on that day on that day ah
uh I think every every everywhere you work lah every month they will have a progress meeting ah
so the
so
ah okay for now you
you just follow my engineer
these big drawings construction drawings
err the size
this ah project lah
so
that that repeated for maybe two or three days ah
who who was was I was supposed to
to follow
so okay lah and then
he literally
ya ya I am ah
ya err
I'm I'm the I'm engineer but not for this project my upcoming project haven't start yet
ah so ya
the only
err the higher up
once a month ah just for the meeting ah just for the progress meeting mm
ah ya ya
so ya then err that that was it lah
it's like maybe err five five workers five staff or five to six ah mm
he's from uh
ya
ah ah ah
so ah and ah this ah
organisation he he he is a student from this err organisation ah
err
err the the students from china during the err
try try to
err like err
mm
uh
what um what's the
ah ya ya ya ah
err err like
ah language barrier and
err in in his own world lah
err err
ah ya office hours ah
stay back at work sia
then
only then you understand
what he meant ah which is true ah which is true ah ah ya ya
this industry like this is the work environment that I'm gonna be in
err
err wasted kan
err in this industry just just to just to have a job ah just to have a job and just help out help out the
uh pay the bills have part of the family ya which I which I did lah then
err
this thing
there were also doubt in my mind lah
for all the new stuff so okay go for the induction course get to meet all the new staff of course you all the staff are all are of different ages ah it's not it's it's no longer
err that time was like what
early twenties lah kan early twenties
then you literally work your way up ah
but at that point
didn't didn't thought had that in mind lah
ya so
err
ah like
and it also ah
you need to have some technical knowledge lah which I was lacking ah
err with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking ah
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad ah
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas lah
so
ah
oh okay
mm ya ya
so ya err
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
ah consultants usually they provide the technical err aspect ah
so err when when when whenever you
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
what I
what was more on the soft skills
but
ah when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it lah
ah
a a
a degree lah then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
err previously was unisim now they call it ah
ya so
then you decided not to
okay ah
good for you lah good for you I mean
ah ya so
I took up
err my part-time degree
oh everyones
at that time ya like
really take up a degree in what really interest you ah
mm mm
ya
in the industry because your industry uh
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
uh with the the the
bosses like
doing this long term
like ah so like
uh we are a big
and then they got their directors lah and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy ah
like sometimes the conflict like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally ah living a comfortable life ah
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to
under production ah
under it's under ah
took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
as you grow older time kau akan rasa time is like you you will feel the time pressure lah
like you are running out of time ah so
we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
we are are we
pick up another three years of study
at that time was
was so was want to
ah there's this
err
it's called a ah
and then the new zealand err working holiday is is a visa lah basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
err the visa is for six months
err
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
uh is that horticulture industry lah
reservist dah approve
the more money I have can save up the more money
so this early this year when COVID everything happen eh like
only god knows what I was feeling ah at that time like
oh singapore at at first
ah ah at first
the new zealand government they
announce they close the borders
so like
for the first two months like that one
ah april ah
yes yes uh huh
at that time when when the the the
the news was was at at its height eh like
got diagnosed positive COVID positive ah and she was seated like ah three
three or four tables behind me which is
you have a lot of things planned already eh any like for everything to come crashing down eh it's really disappointing ah ah but
err at that time we just ah
ya but then err then
after that things happen

hmm three wishes right
I want to help the poor maybe uh I feel that err it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then next uh the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes furqan
uh
my views on what your wishes are it's actually uh is very good from what I see you are a people person like err like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at tampines I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like err taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say uh for example I I share an example ah
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food uh food court I teleport to the place
then after that uh I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay err you said it can increase because the person uh didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so err let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about err going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and uh maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's uh maybe uh the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
we only expose to the office
ah which is easier to contact tourists
it is uh something
err
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know err be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
err I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one err mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of uh being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe uh act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but err
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it uh
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that err you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to uh ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that err you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means err if a person is a father
okay so err what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of uh two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man uh should isolate himself
for months
I feel uh I I agree to a certain extent err where
let's say this person have uh no responsibility maybe uh no parents no siblings no children no wives then uh I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say err okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example uh a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
actually err pretty similar ah on on the investment part because err actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves err a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
err
if you were to tell me that investment is uh is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe err last time I was maybe too good ah I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society err when they see oh a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much err about monetary err maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old err ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more uh gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this uh money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go uh anywhere that I want because err there's a certain level of err financial freedom I would say
second topic
oh my my memory memory is err degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
oh I admit uh do you have you heard of uh about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep uh items
or uh photos ah to then err to keep in a secret place or maybe err some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video err it's like a conversation with uh my old my my oldest self so let's say err my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually err when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so uh I just hope I don't lose the video lah actually I don't even remember where is it now
hmm I like to be famous yes
but
but uh I think is uh if I were to take myself a picture of myself err every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
one of the nicer waters in uh asia that uh that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic err trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so err I think there is err what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of uh funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that err short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then uh another err much more serious err
uh experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me err makes me err
then err maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was uh I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that err jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to uh go into uh into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then err
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that err it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually err and even err just now I was riding a bike
err due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so uh I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
uh
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
err someone is err or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of err delivery riders who is uh riding very recklessly around uh uh on the road ah because they are
err chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe uh road uh sorry uh lorry drivers lorry drivers
err less trip
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because err err when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example err if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can err plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering uh maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that err we are not so err I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe uh three hobbies one is err maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start err ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
err I would know I'm I'm not really a good uh soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because err I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that uh soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me err easily when whenever err people especially uh in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said oh let's play soccer outside
uh this way you gain uh relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and err in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems err I think is is is quite interesting
err
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some err activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure uh how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because err in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals err so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less err how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think uh as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
err
so far I think eh all the err hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from err we are kind of uh similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

okay
eh I need
ya anyway this one danish coming over sia he want meet me for a while
it's been a while lah

those typical western stall at the hawker
ya
ya ya okay I get what you mean like poly one lah the one you know beside the
the Idah's Kitchen

remember
uh no no it's like
you know the that stretch right
it's the last the first shop near the drinks stall
that one to the end
not last stretch the first you know that stretch right it's the first stall closest to the
drink stall
ya before korean it was western it's uh mother and son uh partnership
huh serious wah that one is damn good man and it's like also pretty cheap also like
I think normal platter like say chicken chop ah only four fifty or what
with two sides

um cheap or what right my portion is like still worth way more worth than what you are getting outside
oh it's too much ah
mm
no no they don't
ya ya ya
oh okay I think I know I know but I never eat never tried it
oh
ya correct
ha play ah more you can play more pub games ah I feel bots like no point ah
because all the toxic uh opponents or teammates right
it's because your team is terrible that's why you feel like opponent is good
sometimes serious ah especially the filipinos and the pinoys in DOTA wah
damn toxic man they like I don't know what they doing most of the time
then they will just start blaming you all these kind stuff but entertainment also ah
oh genshin is just my browser not loading ah I think if maybe got to do with my internet connection at that point in time
but I yet to try again ah
the main part of the whole thing ah
mm
but like
ah
ya ya ya
that's a like chakra
uh huh
okay
uh huh
ah
then after that you got to wait until the thing will recharge or what you gotta hunt for the reason the resin
oh I see I see
but like
ya ya
so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
mm
ya right right right
the best so far
one of ah
ah better than runescape
ah
ya confirm laze ah after a while
ya ya
maybe lah perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but I think they earning a lot sia this game it's like available on all platform except like console lah
you can whale on genshin also
uh huh
huh wah this crazy ah
wah
so you think this one more
you know money intensive or maple
ah
do you even spent money on games
orh okay ya okay makes sense
orh
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
oh
ya ya ya
oh why eh
how I know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
bayern very sick
ya ya okay
ya I know stop back forth back forth ah
hmm ya each to its own ah
ha when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
fuh
when's the last time when's the last time you went
ah
oh so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
can ah try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent ah and like
they really build up their name eh you know like
those DOTA players players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by uh Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there ah pretty nice lah you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same ah throughout all these brands I would say
ah
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
mm
ya
eh but this one is like high quality leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do lah but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these uh
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding eh I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
uh let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than eh APOL is three nine eight
ya
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
uh that one obvious sia the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like um forceful kind of you know
what they call it ah damage on your behalf then it would be voided ah
I
over time maybe yes ah
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
uh huh
ya kinda it is it is
ya
that's true ah Coke like damn sweet eh I I'm not a fan of Coke ah it's too sweet for me
ah
ya standard correct
ah
oh carton
ah
ya ya syrup kind of base drink ah
that's non-fizzy
mm Seasons the blue colour one right
that's the green tea ice lemon tea eh is it
sugar
ya
ya I agree I agree
eh wait seasons
oh I think I got I think I never try Seasons uh peach tea before eh
oh no I don't think so eh the I can't recall
maybe ah
mm
uh
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
because you got the mindset lah like you know there's a
relax corner in school
ya
ya true true
uh
I also finding ah I want find like uh you know like stable kind of part-time
and nine dollars ah if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of um eatery
never banquet I never do before that time was uh kitchen job ah
ya Grand Hyatt ah
so you know when banquet uh how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already ah that's why
orh
Shangri-La
uh huh
gary gary kan you know gary then the alex those people
events
ah ya ya ya they are events uh lighting all this kind of stuff
oh
orh
uh huh
a'ah
oh
ya ya
so it's a win win
it's a win win situation lah
ya
true
because
eh since when you care sia bro
okay lah okay lah uh you changed man right
no the swedish bistro uh they call it
ya
uh huh
I'm not sure ah if that's Fika or something some other cafe near arab street last time
mm
err but how much was the food
so Fika or the what's that called ah
Malayan Council eh
huh serious
I never tried that food before ah but the desserts not bad ah quite delicious
uh ya my sis told me also because the boss kan like it's uh this chinese guy
he's she say their service his service is top notch because he knows how to treat their customer right ah
ah
ya that's why that's why is the owner is smart he
mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he he knows the owner
uh the next time they just go then use the voucher to get like
you know cakes and uh tea or something like that

go there then step give the akshay face ah
no beef lah then like just laze ah

wah I need to watch the thing
ya that's why at first I thought it was like a
just a group of friends they just wanna try something then until I see the pro skater came into their video

eh
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish uh cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
huh
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like uh it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
ah ya something like that
but it's quite dope ah
ya

I think and
say again

the new series which is the what's that ah Vita
ah Vita Vita
Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
I think
mm I think the main appeal is just because can support the
uh what's Pokemon games people literally buy just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new what this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame lah to me

okay so

put six hundred for
super expensive
but then like if you are buying the three room but then like it's small like I mean like last time four and last time
like four room is now's five room
like five room
and then after that if you want to talk like realistically
like I wouldn't even spend
more than four hundred thousand
on a house
my whole life paying for the house
ya
the house this house that I'm staying at used to cost like only like one hundred and eighty K
and now it's like
super high eh
hais but ya I wouldn't pay four hundred dollars four hundred thousand four hundred dollars
four hundred
ya I won't pay above four hundred thousand for a house
if let's say I want okay ah since my dream house is the what's that called
the a pool of that one right
if I ya golf club

my four hundred K
there

okay toodles

yes
uh
ya I remember I saw the vinny guy lah and I can tell that he is very self-aware that people are talking about him ah
so I remember like just looking at him then like I was looking at shu then I was like eh
maybe we just go closer look ah then we we I don't know whether I was being very loud or he's just that attentive to people around him right but he was looking at us
then I was looking at him then I wanted to like um you're the shit bag who is having a weird relationship with this russian lady that is telling people how to do burlesque
err
and straits times so I was like thinking oh shoot I should have like told shu about it lah cause shu is always searching for
like articles to write about and it's going to like help her a lot more to err
like at least advance ah cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
or if you yourself have something nice to talk about and can you know I can set it up you can be famous
do you know that shura is like two years older than me right like she's like my age right
wait that's this is a good question would you ever date someone younger than me
ya
I'm twenty four this year
I'm twenty four lah
and you're almost thirty
ya
no as in
you're twenty nine years old this year would you date her
what the heck
I can tell that you have uh very very no filter
my goodness
and that's something a fact that I wish I could change
err when she want to move ah because the house is bought
but she needs to move out by end of the year I think
eh no no she needs to move out by next she needs to
move out by next year june or march
showed me and mum the other day when I was at her house
because nobody loves you
just want to put it out there
ya anyway um
we brought madrina in the conversation
err what's the word ah uh
or maybe that is a
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
err a few days
after my birthday ya
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like
couldn't freaking leave me alone then like I was trying to shake him off
can I come the next day
and that stuff
nazri
I can tell I can tell that you you
wow so deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from shura and all my other female friends as possible
mm no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
mm mm maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
is the liberal one is the consecutive
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
oh my god reminds me of the remember when um
running man was super big and then running man running man
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
so after that um
we noticed there was a lot of err people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
jia hui jia xing eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
I remember um
so mister jamal he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
trumpist I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter ah I have no idea lah that trumpet players ah like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world lah like he told us that
err he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because err back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown lah
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that ah
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in err chicago lah
so he would play the trumpet and then his
um his
friend would play the piano
so err I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior lah who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister jamal right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this ah
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts lah
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
err the
like the ah because he was wearing those
err
football jerseys ah like those what cowboys ah patriots
okay I know that
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of kasanaz I'm sure you remember kasanaz
so kasanaz's husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer ah to the point that
they live in singapore but by right kasanaz doesn't need to work
kasanaz is like apparently like got money kind of like girl lah but I believe the husband is those
chief engineer or something ah like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time ah
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
kasanaz knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that wei xiang is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like wei xiang first of all right
you and me ah
ah both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university lah
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense lah since you like you
somehow educated lah most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties ah who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs ah
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the err the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in lah
so ya lor
I believe he's just a cashier
mm
you know err he used to intern for supply chain for
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
err so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company eh you intern for like a really
big
err
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay lah no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip ah
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also ah
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example temasek right temasek holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance err teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with temasek then we were like bonds ah
you know shares right you can buy like hundred ah
yes so it's really like you need to have money ah
ya
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away lah but
it's a bit sad lah like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan lah the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years ah I have one lah
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money mah and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents ah cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad lah quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what lah those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever lah so I'm just like
why
the I remember it's quite insane lah like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue lah
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome ah
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
err
wei xiang was quite a
like not say an advocate lah he was quite a
this at this
restaurant at this then wei xiang didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists uh near the library
yes
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat meh with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no lah so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was uh didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the uh boyfriend was studying ah architecture or something ah
and then the boyfriend he's err
he's got money lah he's rich I forgot what the father does ah
err the father quite strict with the money ah
like I remember the father once said that
err got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten lah then the father got so pissed the father said
err
since you on the aircon after ten right err ah your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
um divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
I think the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings ah
I don't know
I don't know lah
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so wah talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go jakarta one
second thing right they always go jakarta on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
jakarta right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
dubai or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
mm go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money wei xiang give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them ah but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can lah one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no lah you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be dee kosh
don't prey on kids
seriously dee kosh is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
err okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew lah his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me eh raf want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called lah then he was like oh my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking dee kosh then I'm like huh what you dee kosh wants you to model for him ah he's like no dee kosh wants to suck my then I'm like
eh wait wait wait wait wait eh you don't anyhow hor
then he show me the like the text lah so I was like
you're this guy is insane eh you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am dee kosh your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like oh you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that um
like then later on he'll be like oh like err
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars lah
no obviously I don't know dee kosh I'm telling my friend that
no so um I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal lah hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid lah there are apps and all these mah
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these lah cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people mah like
no one agreed to this ah and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this ah so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
it's the same as uh you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
a'ah the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said ah is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal lah you can't like solicit sex for cash lah I believe
that is
wrong lah like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong lah I don't know how how wrong it is lah in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due err not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not lah
I don't know right is not a good enough um
answer to to evict you from like err
like
a a sentence ah it's like that there was this guy who
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone err he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
err with drugs ah that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge lah he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious meh for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
it's err it's not a good enough err like what you call it
defence ah the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
he the guy never say or whatever right ah
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
err lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine lah like the person cannot say because the person lied mah
and the person tricked you into it but dee kosh I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that oh I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only mah
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly lah but like people like
influence ah
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific lah social media influences ah
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle lah
that's between the followers and them ah some people will like ah it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and ah you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense ah like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this lah but we don't empower him to do the things he do mah
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram ah Instagram empowers him lah Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things ah
nicole choo
yes
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is ah the world evolves in this way lah so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition lah everything like happens because something happens mah
so like it's just evolution lah like something ee the previous generation must have done right has created this lah
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it lah I feel like I created monsters
which is true lah I remember she was the first
real socialite lah because before kardashian there was her what
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich eh like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite ah she's like those
rothschild
like what
legendary families ah like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
um
uh can't really think of any other people like right now lah but
and all of course all your shakes ah
how do I put it lah like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it lah it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes ah to tell people like what they're doing is wrong lah if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it lah like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste lah I personally don't like any of these people lah like to me my
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like oh there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no lah I mean if I'm
err I'll go down to town and buy it lah if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges lah what I put inside my bag lah my house
tour lah how much money is in my bank lah my mother underwear what colour lah
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives lah they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in err
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
life eh when he on a day that he has fights
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
err
an person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is ah it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling ah
no lah the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen

ah
which is just a piece of wood
julie also was like okay lah
that's what my mum was texting ah ya she's like that right you know right
and this is one of us
but how you want to justify it doesn't
false declarations no was dry
daddy bear
he wants the freedom
because
is it block leave or clear instructed
oh you got your zoom ward meeting
okay
what hospital
it was initially ya it stopped I could have done it I could have done it lah but then because tonight my wife works night shift so she's gonna go to work at roughly
no they got time limit so when you book your time right it's one hour when you book then you don't want to go always right waste time but I didn't but that time when I went was okay lah but it's a it's a service free
one room I mean I just bring my wife so we can still hang out with my friend ah yay do the what first ya
no no no no I still need to send it to let them go and
so like most of us will be there lah I think it's suraya
could be five I'm not too sure depends on what language they speak on that day I mean I actually grew up with it what my mum
my guy I got one I think I I got one ah
british guy
he's from fulham fulham
salad singapore I want to do the salad
no oh my god he is he is kind of two left feet actually ya but that's the thing I feel like he's like he he okay like two left feet but then I think he plays soccer actually he he plays soccer so ah the thing is that they said he started coming like more often ever since circuit breaker I think like his normal amateur soccer games or whatever is like so common nowadays so that's why he every saturday will be there for training
so that's what I'm like telling my guy he said okay
ah supposedly there is lah but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad lah ya
what
huh
hais can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here
then
so that's where I learn photoshop lah but then like forget how to do photoshop
I used to do photography in schools
ya you will but I think like it's like so far it was like primary school ya forget it anyway I stop doing it when my friend passed away because we used to be partners together then he passed away in secondary school
and then after that because I I know the whole I know the whole family lah yeah because after that I I found out from my mum that actually
yup I forgot why the brother passed away but it's really sad ah then I only found out cause after he passed away then he contact no lah
only one only one one one of my girlfriends
yeah she was a good friend lah we've been friends now I think twenty odd years twenty one years
but now we we talk to each other lesser
ah I didn't really have a good reputation in school
yeah it doesn't really matter to me lah
I don't I don't I don't really care what people think about me
ya in a way I mean in a way like if you want to talk bad about me so be it lah I won't I won't lose sleep over it
ya
all going out for supper party not all all thank you
she can speak chinese what then trilingual
K bye swee ling
papa bear and aunty bear go for breakfast
so mama bear not in all the bears go out today
went already what just now ya he was in office
ya which you quite elated right because of how he looks
ya the company closed down what company is it ah huh
oh jamco
jamco I think
because that time one of like because one of my classmates he's like working for those kind of companies kan the engineering stuff and then he didn't see that they are going through retrenchment soon or something like that at that point of time during our exam so like very busy
why really what you watch big bang theory big bang theory not really
uh
the only the only constant is change
I know ya the only constant thing is change
it is do you do you restart
let's say you were not actually doesn't matter lah
no no no what I meant doesn't matter is just okay did you apply through the app
any customers yet
no no one has reached out to yellow door yoga
Y D Y
yellow door yellow door Y D Y Y Y yellow door
come to yellow yoga
balance
can there's a lot of people doing it so you got to be ya you find a niche what
got no cases what
oh are you hungry
no I have not
well my wife say she'll wake up in the morning for breakfast but apparently she didn't wake up
ah no it's like that
so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
but that one starhub what I don't know
oh
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to lah have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy lah you have to but this one because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
very actually laggy lah the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this one but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software err no it's in english
of course of course it is still on I mean cable cable in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch per say when is the last time you watch
or cinemax or
okay lah
you want to take it up is it free really but is it one year course I mean like one day course lah
so you have to go down to go to the thing
and that ya but the chinese people can can function with their language uh
but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
it's in
latin form ah so
which one
oh ya
ah no because in october
so because the people the colleagues so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so
siala no I just I just told her you try december lah no she stuck in october so so it's like so now if you want september october november october is the one that stuck so okay lah november december
I don't know lah but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply lah said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't lah cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see
ya I think they will I don't think they will just I think they will give a buffer cause previously come on lah even with our colleagues also some of them also huh what's that it's been how many months been around what still don't know what's going on
it's been awhile already
it's been almost two years since I did it
no when she came she actually asked for malay speaking officer then I was like then I'm like eh malay speaking
malay speaking
why seh
then I went
yvonne
something like that
I'm hungry
orh
um but I think
they will change I think
I mean okay lah that one I let people go to the extreme
sabo sabo king
err
but daddy bear actually could ah not really cause the one outside technically the switch is inside yup no the thing is it is cold then just shift lah maybe your side is what you you're technically under the vent oh ya actually she cannot if you think is no I never honestly why would I touch it's there ya ya here so that time like julie did ask me like but I was doing work
okay what are you doing what's this how come you are logged in oh okay
eh what's the
not him right who I don't even know okay I really don't know who is shankar khan you really got me lost there

speak of the devil
twenty that day also I
I can't even I can't even smell the lychee
eh my mother in law went out to geylang
uh or maybe it's your earpiece

your life is easy ah life is simple and like
if everything you want you get no you don't have to work hard for it
ya like
as in ya lah
so
ya that's that's that's what's up
but ya in terms
in terms of my life
like
okay um
uh in a girl for you to you know
basically uh
like we know you can find but
like obviously the perfect qualities like
what you're you're saying is isn't isn't going to be like totally achievable lah like I don't think everyone would
eh ah like a lot of you can easily find
someone like that ah so like
catch my eye is err is the girl funny ah to me if they're funny
to me if they're funny
I mean like uh
if I would say myself this is called green flag ah for like if they can make me laugh
like a lot of the girls lah
maybe I I think it's biased a bit
it's quite biased because a lot of the girls
you know
and ya I've only met like what
so ya like and another quality is I would say that's achievable
um
so what you think ah
I mean you're being very honest already ah with me like been telling uh yours your
stories about your ex
like I want I want to be honest ah also like share
with you about mine my first one was
ah
a'ah
but then like
uh I will just uh
and then uh I went for it I went for it and then
ah sweat and then
and what would I want to what would I want to answer right like I I I don't know if I can think properly ah
ah
hi like uh I think you're I think you're pretty and um you know you seem like such a a nice girl to you know talk to and err I hope you don't mind if uh if I wanted to be friends with you ah
and uh
ah switch off switch on
freshen up
she doesn't mind ah so I was like uh wow
was like oh wow and then my reply was oh wow I didn't expect her to be because I
I was in a fifty fifty ah thing ah where I expect her
uh you know I will just
overjoyed ah I was over I was just overjoyed ah and excited to you know ah talk to her and then she said like she didn't mind and then I
err oh wow
I didn't expect her to reply and then uh
so we we talk and then after that we started to talk ah she was like replying
constantly and then uh
ah
oh K K
in her and I was like
in front of my me
ah
and then
it went ah it went well
uh it went well until
you know she was
the first day lah
ah
and then uh
you know you were happy and then we went our first date ah
okay ah everything went well and then at this one point ah
and then she and then like
ah she just said that
um
the whole thing
like your first
uh huh
as in
oh
almost everything ah and then
uh
ah
they didn't
you could say that uh you could say that it was long ah
and it was my the first time what so I didn't know what to do so I was like
and when I was in denial I was like
still uh
I wouldn't say want to force ah it was just like
maybe in that in a sense I guilt trip her not really guilt trip her lah but maybe maybe it was ah
it was just so heartbreaking ah you know for me
ah
cold also she said thanks that's all like literally that's all
and then that was I guess
err the last straw ah
final one
ya
ah then ya then basically I just move on ah because it was my first I don't know what to do I feel scared
so I just I had to move on with life and I did ah somehow I did
I mean I guess it was good for me ah I was the first
you know and uh you cannot expect the first to be your last
I mean um
that's one
err but I guess
a'ah lah
as in example ah
um
the second one
the second one okay the second one
for feeling this way because
she was my second and I'm already having
okay so this my second ah it was in my
my you know uh it was my first year in NITEC
and
err I saw her ah
and then
contact ah and then
and uh just looking around ah I'm just like
and then
same thing you know
ah I was excited you know again I felt that way somewhat I fell away again
and then you know we talk know I was excited I was entertained
she was very funny
okay she was very funny um
uh I like her ah pretty much the from the start I was like I like
ah
I never thought like it would be with this girl and then like
and you know we went to dates we went to everything she was funny know she entertain me she understood me err
you know again
this
uh
um
err
she's not feeling it anymore ah
and
ah
and then again ah like like just the previous one again like again everything I thought it was going good you know and
I saw her as this girl that
she was just perfect ah in even in her most
a touchy thing to say so ya and I'm being honest ah like she was like even in her imperfectness I saw perfectness ah so
she was my ideal girl ah in
in in fact ah you know like
so when she said that I was like
in shock and like again I took it
I I can say I took it better than the previous one ah how I took it was better
you know
so I say like and and then when I tried to like talk her out of it I talk about the last relationship the last relationship like how I went to go with it you know how I pestered
so I told her like ah okay lah then I cannot do anything about it
I just want you to be happy ah that's
so
err
and I'll I still do ah still do care about her ah
um
you know and she's
amazing ah so till this day she's still amazing ah and
so I move on with uh my life and she move on with hers so she give
she give me her closure in her own way and uh you know
we stick out we somehow made it as a friends ah you know
ya so ya I guess somehow we made it as friends you could say friends ah till this day because we still
mm
ah
I think she got with like
err in total like
two guys after me so
and then
ah
we were just friends time and time again I will ask about her I will ask her like how's
how it was good how it was going you know for her
and
because I truly cared for her ah like I could say after the break up I
even till this day I could say that
I would say I still think like about her like what she's doing like how is she is she fine
and
on occasionally as I said ah I would ask her ah
you know she also ask me like how am I doing and like
update me on some stuff
then to me it's fine ah I think to me what we have is
I think I believe that both of us what I believe is we both have
we like to believe that we both have moved on ah and I think I moved on
like in fair enough to say I moved on ah just that I just care about her as as some as someone
who
was special to me at one point in my life
and then um
we so we just kept in contact and then I met this girl
err and she was also with another man
if I'm not wrong ah
no ah it was very mature ah for me it was mature ah as much as
it was a mature relationship between me and her it's not like we meet meet still meet up or what you know
ah
err
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days ah some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone ah I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
ah
something like that ah
oh ah
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now err
I was
still in process ah honestly I was still in process ah low-key I was still in process
but
err
somehow I I
I move on ah I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is ah and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
err I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
ah I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
um
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay ah maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening ah
but it feels it feels like a crime ah sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having ah because I really love what we are having already ah so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good ah
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask lah like
what what what went wrong
ah
okay so it's like
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride ah I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous ah
my previous
girl lah and
to me it's fine I guess you know uh as you said also I think it's fine ah
so and it's okay ah
um
mm
but
doing my best as well ah so if it goes to where
but if not
like
uh
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
okay okay
first thing
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is uh
you know I learnt how to accept
err
third thing thing is uh I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time ah
um
true ya what you said is true ah and
ya and then you know those are the three lessons ah
and
uh I guess so far it's been great ah when
I don't want to say
I don't want to say she's my last
but I hope so
good thing like in what way
or like
err

err ya I mean I was pretty good at it ah I wouldn't say I'm like one the at it I'm pretty good at it I survived there for seven seven years but after around five years
letting you resign you stay for one more year okay then I stay for one year so six years already at the end of the six years the the yearly review you know the one to one talk with the bosses then I said okay I'm gonna to resign already no no no you stay for one more year okay dah stay I there they manage to stop me
so after seven years when I went into the living room I went in I sit down with my manager and my director before I sat down I told them okay both of you be quiet I'm going to talk
I told them I'm going to resign and there's nothing both of you can say that I that will make me stay okay so that's that I don't want to hear my grade I don't want to hear how much bonus you wanna give me I want to resign
ah
mm
ya it ya that's a good thing about government job is literally what they call iron rice bowl so I'm very I'm pretty sure that even during now this COVID time I will still be getting my pay eventhough work from home and all that I will not ever be getting retrenched from a government job
but I wouldn't say five ah I couldn't see three more years in that job
so I just okay that's it no more already so I went to I went to sales

that happened then I'm like okay that's weird that's also actually quite embarrassed and I'm like okay

okay
alright
ah
tenet
okay ah basically he borrowed money without my knowledge
this is less still shady ah
I don't know who
thing is
what
whether
damn
ya
ya
ya
basically like he was caught in the crossfire lah
once in the
ah
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
you tell
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
last month last month not a lot lah close to one thousand
yup that's it ah
at least that's the only thing I know of ah
uh his credit rating is bad
I think he needed money ah
ya
oh that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
don't do this ah
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
you know right not the end of this month next month lah cause our initial agreement was six months what
uh next year
friend ah
no one listens to me kan
the voice of reason
ya
now I have problem
I have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem I don't care ah that kind of thing ah
ya
I have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it as it fixes my problem now
ya
actually by end of this month
but
like I did tell
ya just say just say
ya
but
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed ah
rightfully so ah to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
you have a place to go but you rather not ah
that kind of situation ah
ya basically lah same thing ah
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it ah
but
now seeing this
you know
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend ah rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
I have
I have
eh
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know oh but
you know people are driven by greed what some people do not know how to control their greed
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you what
um
ya he left
uh some cash cause I don't know ah he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
mm
mm
ya
ya
alright
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap ah
okay
so
mm
sort of
fahim no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know lah whether
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl lah
I mean technically there is a plague going on ah
okay
okay
mm
mm
okay
hmm
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably lah eh
mm
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does tau maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
ah
ya ya like it it's inside lah and so it's called what you said is right correct pe
ya
why you were there lah at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
be a part of it lah cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend ah
um
in a moral dilemma every time
that
you know I don't feel good that she's there
it doesn't feel right what
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that oh I'm approving this ah it feels wrong ah
so it puts us in a tough spot ah
back then ah
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical farid lah
like shadow boy shadow boy
I think eight years
oh
okay
mm
what the
okay
hmm
loco ah
I wouldn't
know what
she's gonna be there
it came to a point where if riz there she's there
so we knew what to expect ah
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
um from what I see eh
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs ah maybe she fulfils both not sure
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here ah ah the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him ah
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks ah
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all lah definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
not saying that it's super common lah no lah just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
ah recklessness um
probably lack of ambition
ah ya privilege ah ya lah
usually
usually lah generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things ah
generally speaking ah
so based and on that
um
scenario like you always quite common ah for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible lah I'm not saying that
bad point would be
or fittest lah even
not not even the fittest man alive ah
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
oh did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already lah
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist ah
it's nonsense
ya
sial lah brunei
ya
mm
oh is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
mm
oh
mm
ya ya ya
okay let's just call them government eh
if the government invest in their infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism ah
for investment
attack tourism ah
yup that that's the thing
country
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia lah but still quite bad lah
if you look at the ah if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free lah it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or I think
ah then uni isn't free
ya it should be lah or very heavily subsidise ah
but it's not okay ah let's talk about
oh so just now you wanted
to ask about
oh khai right
ya
anything lah
ya
oh
more
when it comes to that and
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her lah
too trivial lah to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
you know how we talk kan
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
something like that lah
oh mistress
well he consented to it lah so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know ah
then she slimmer
ya
if you want to do this
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out wai was the one who needed help
so ya
I mean that's why he deal lah him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant lah rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married lah if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her lah personally
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
ya probably yup
oh six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
fifty percent is fine what it's both of your kid anyway
ya
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it lah
the rest I have to iron
yes exactly
oh okay ah
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
safwan told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
his name is saifuddin
then zafran I think zafran has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her lah
so I don't know
oh when life is good
eh
I'm on a
the frequency of how how I eat
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult ah
huh
I ate at four
so eat something light at night ya
it's
sixty one
ya
when we started going to the gym
ah still very very slightly above average very slightly
and based on ah
healthy ah range
but ah same lah
a
ya louder that ah
true
didn't factor that in ah
sial lah
err should be more
actually should use the malaysia malaysia one
eh should be more accurate for malay
sial ah
ah yes
one six seven
you're going to do it now
of what obesity
ya average or healthy ah
ya
wah slightly above average ah okay pe
okay lah
chonky
ya I remember
I remember
absolute unit ah
I think the heaviest I was I think lah cause I didn't check my weight for very long time think seventy I think so then it was it was good lah that that I went for the christmas dinner
I should do something about it lah
then it was difficult lah initially very difficult
then
no no no no
yup

because we still need to
let's say we buy ah
mm

mm better kan
mm
okay
ya lah of course not not not straightaway lah not straightaway
yup
correct
mmhmm
mm
but it anyway it's just a
fake wall jer
hmm
can can
mmhmm
this this block
I'm not sure whether we have bomb shelter or not
but not all
should be okay lah
uh
you know the built-in wardrobe
that one we leave it
mmhmm
I want to make it into guest room
mm

mmhmm
ya I know
mmhmm
mmhmm
I know
it's built
mmhmm
ya
I know
I know
so
so that we can have three
one two three
ah
mm
but if you open this one
the one that you can slot in right
so that that drawer
you can actually see
a'ah
it's like glass
mm mm
something like that
ya
mmhmm
why would I want to walk again
it's not
ya it's not
mm it's not the as squeezy as that it's not as squeezy as this
it's like
it's like
this
ah
mm
can don't worry
it's not that squeezy
about this size about this wall
mm
no it's not that squeezy
stand ah
I'm not gonna put uh chair down there
mm because beside that
no beside that
ah
correct
beside that mm
so
okay
like if you want to sit down
okay
it's up to you
okay can
this is because this is our stuff
then you can when you open you can see from inside you can see
mmhmm
definitely
mmhmm mmhmm
mm
then ah okay so beside that you have this one
and then my side
side of the bed lah
mm
side pillar
okay
table
just a wall lah
because that is when where you want to
your projector you want to
mmhmm mmhmm
understood
can show
okay
what is it with you and frames
why
no it doesn't
no it doesn't
no it doesn't cheer up the room
it looks like
mmhmm mmhmm
I understand I understand
all the sentimental values and all that I understand it's just that
why frame it
why
why would you look at it
if you put it in album why would you look at it once in a few years
even if you put
you won't look at it everyday what
it's there but you won't look at it everyday
then then like that
no need to have frame lah
feature wall
we are teenagers
so you want to look like old people
mm
I'm not that old
what is that face
and
and
ya I do
and
mm
okay
whatever
okay
take lah take lah take lah take lah
eh then you have your
whole wall then I have
wow
mm
mmhmm
okay
of course
ah I need to check again because the last one I check is ah about
two hundred one hundred to two hundred plus ah something like that
one hundred plus why not
okay then maybe two hundred plus
fine then three hundred it is
okay fine then it will
then I find the
why cannot
if I'm not wrong there's a
uh
price for it
so based on that based on that ya based on that I think is about two hundred plus
true
mm
mmhmm
then say lah you put your price like that what
you advertise five room mah
you advertise five room this this price this price and then now you you come then you want to charge more cannot what
one one five
mm
aiya cincai lah cincai lah
nothing
no I was thinking
I was thinking about
the the things that I saw on their
advertise advertisement
yes definitely
ya
mmhmm
but if you wash the sanitisation will wear off
means wash first no no no no
no when we go and check the house we must make sure that they already clean the house
and clean already the house
correct
built-in
okay
then we need to find housekeeping
because down there they put cleaning and sanitisation you know
no no inside the inside the in Carousell the one that I see it's cleaning and sanitisation
mm
wow you want people to scrub some more then you scrub yourself lah
they will have a special
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
that chemical

ya
what's your favourite
ya ya ya ya
ya
uh because the thing is like uh when I first saw the trailer
I was quite behind the hype already lah in a way
ya
um
orh okay
ya because uh
when I started uh I think I don't know how like err I was in cause I think um a lot of people watch already but ah even then when I watch later the hype was still there so err the main thing for me it's just I can't wait for season two so uh I haven't started yet but I'm going to try watch the manga eh I I'm gonna read the manga sorry not watch ya but it was really good lah ya
mm
then it ended
orh september
oh ah ah
ah
oh one shot ah
rise up ah ya
ya
mm mm
naruto
ah
mm
ya
ah um avengers endgame ah
very rare so I was blown away ah
ah no lah ya ya
mm mm
ya lumen six ya but
ya he's so strong he got so pissed off when uh nezuko and tanjiro killed him but he attach his neck using the spider web but for me like what the heck seriously he just cut off what it's such a coward move but gui is just
ya
ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct
ya
mm
blow me away it's okay
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya and the part when he everytime when he kill the demon right he always like
uh I think that's the main ah unique point of ah demon slayer it's not just about killing demons it's about having a heart
mm
correct correct
mm
correct correct yes
ya ya ya
mm
correct
ya correct
ya that's why but the thing the thing that uh um
one piece eh uh because uh naruto the one I saw on Netflix is like
nine season
oh
mm mm
ya
mm
orh short film
mm
ya
ah
pe
ya ya ya
mm
mm
ya
ya
correct correct
standard ya
uh bachelor of arts
in game design not bachelor of science one science is programing ah ya
ya
mm
mm
that's why
ya ah the the velocity part I think
ah
correct
ya ya ya ya ya ya
mm
mm
oh
mm famous ah ya ya ya
true like cannot generalise
mm
mm
correct
mmhmm
ya ya correct
mm
mm mm
ya
ya
when I started
mm
mm mm
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
correct correct
ya ya
people think like you don't do your err revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is ah sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
mm
ya
oh this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
mm
mm
mm
oh okay okay
mm
ya ya correct correct
mm
ya
uh ya ya ya ya ya
but it depends on the person itself lah but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice ah ya when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
ya
ya
ah
ah
mm
correct correct
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best lah cause over time like you have to
um adapt ah I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
uh
err for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest ah this one I haven't share with you before uh so um
I kind of err didn't sit for my paper
ya so err this news right I'm just telling you this um okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that um if you don't sit for your paper
and then uh if you have err I think the requirement for the assignments is like err forty percent and above that means your over ah there are two components uh assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without err redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod ah so
for me
okay lah for me since I'm new to it lah like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
orh
oh
like like
oh range oh okay okay okay
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot entirely relate and I don't have the right to lah cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right oh for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different ah assignments and projects ya so because your school is uh assignment and project based my one is ah exam so that's the thing you all also have err
intermittent exams right
math oh my goodness
don't have err
uh not exactly math but I think err since your mum is a english teacher she should know also err there's this thing called err phonetics and um what is it under ah it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like um if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
um put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a um sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part lah
uh
there is one ya ya there is uh the uh what mod I took I think they taught us about err there are some similarities uh between err varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
mm
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
um ya lah because essentially
err they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office sia
oh ya but okay lah uh that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about err
language and society like how people use language and all that that one is more to um
I would say uh you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how ah different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
ah dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's uh in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of err analytical type of a more research based type ya
these two is okay the one that really
headache now eh I wish I I don't have to take is uh literature
but they rebrand it so like no choice ah I just stayed ah cause I have to defer for err one semester
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya ya ya
ya
correct correct
ya
ya
even more pissed off ya ya ya ya
mm mm
mm
yes yes correct correct
mm
ah
ah
seven K
correct correct
ya
because it's quite mentally draining tau if you set the bar too high so you must slowly find the small things that make you happy lah ya and and I heard this phrase before like um
uh sometimes the things that makes us the happiest right doesn't require money ah
ya that's that's that's the most priceless thing that that that that is a golden code lah
correct correct
ya
ya
because they are tuned to it ah
mm
yes
correct correct
mm
yes
correct
correct
ya
you're satisfied ah ya correct correct yes yes
that's why
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya
wah that's quite advanced eh
ya ya
ya
gen Y ya correct eh gen Y or millennial
orh millennial
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya
correct correct
ya
correct ah
mm
ya
correct correct it's like uh it's like an experience uh like um err it takes you on a ride I guess like uh
ride off
what what am I trying to say like roller coaster in motion ah sorry sorry I can't get my thoughts right so it's a it's a good thing like it like it's a temporary escape from reality and like uh you get to experience something and then you just move on in your life ah is
ya
mm
correct correct
mm
ya
demon slayer ya
mm
ya
mm mm yes yes yes
ya
orh yes yes yes
ya
ya correct
ya
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
mm
ya
ya
correct uh there's one prime example uh I think is everyone's favourite
wait is he is not right ah Marvel cinematic universe ah iron man ah he don't have any powers but like he he's uh drive to make the world a better place and too um I think in age of ultron he said he want to like uh have a iron barrier around earth uh to like sort of protect lah but um even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like uh protect what's what matters to him the most ah so like um
get the power from your own uh
err
his ability to uh be a genius
and like uh construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it lah like people always look at the uh powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
uh thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right ah and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes ah and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
I think she was like err um
uh assassin or some sort then she got um err close combat err training and iron man is just err a man with a suit lah but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite err touching ah if you think about it no power tau
mm
ya
correct
yes
mm
mm
ya ya
ya
mm
it motivates you ah in a way
ya
mm mm
mm
ya
higher
mm
mm
mm
mm
yes
mm
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
mm
ya
ya
it's very tough it's not it's not that easy to reach out to people ah
mm
yes
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice um
in the traineeship or the united jobs right cause like since I only part time now ah eh I'm working part time lah ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry ah but my job got suspended because of COVID so like err I cannot work for the meantime so um I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy ah but it's you're on the right track ah so it is relevant lah it's a good thing
mm mm
mm mm
ya
mm
ya ya ya
mm
mm
ya
yes
ya
ya
so so so so technically they are like you but they they because of the err pre-judgement that they might get they just keep quiet and they don't want to approach anyone
ya
ya
yes
ya
correct
ya
mm
ya
ah
ya you need to um get the answer and then like you have to analyse it and then like tune it in a way that it suits your current situation
ya ya
ya ya
ah
mm
mm
tip top ah
nobody want to play ya ya ya correct correct
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
element eh
and in it's an ingredient for you to
mm
ya
it's very useful
ya
ya
ya
but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like err I I heard there's zero the zero gravity why am I stuttering uh the zero gravity there is quite uh
quite intense ah so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve uh being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something ah
ya cause if he want to be married eh buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
that's why
ya
it's another planet
ya
mm
mm
moon burger
ya ya ya
space Grab
ya but how many light years away is mars ah
I never thought about it eh
ya
oh it's not light years
years
oh but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough eh
I don't know how they do it sia seriously
ya ya ya correct
err ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive ah then you wouldn't die ah
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
mm mm
that's right
ya ya ya
ya
correct correct ya ya ya
ya
because you don't have to drive to progress ah then like you just stay stagnant ah like uh because it's not affecting you what and that's the thing about humans lah like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
change ah the ah sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change ah but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the manga or the watch the uh talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of um
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph ah
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
mm
mm
ya
yes
ya
correct correct
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
that's the sad thing right people only recognise people when they die unfortunately
that's a sad thing
ya
mm
ya
ya and they look to you as a way to err
is bangkok the correct word like a way to um set the bar like I I err do as an inspiration ah in a way
ya
so that's the good thing
mm
undertaker
yes oh my god my favourite wrestler then he retire
mm
ya
ya
impact
ah diego maradona
that's quite sad ah
ah ya
mm
ya
I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb eh I guess ah when people pass on they look at the good things ah and they try to overlook the uh bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
um his negative aspects um err
even though they were quite drastic but uh the achievements overshadow that ah but in the end when everyone passes on right is um
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them ah recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper um
what's the word eh passing eh no um ah final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status err for awhile then like um at least you um go in peace ah like ya you don't feel like oh um
there's anything left
ah ya ya ya you you feel like err a burden off your shoulder ah in a way
what's why
mm
making one of the best anime
oh my goodness
ya
mm
that's why it's amazing how this um shows like Marvel anime and all these right like they teach us more
than what we are taught in school it's really interesting right
ya
okay
uh

uh huh
ah
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents ah
mm
mm
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
like become such a cool mum ah
having disputes ah
ah ah ah
mm mm mm
mm
yes
grow up
ya
tense up ah ah
ya ya
fight ah ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing ah ya
ya ya
ya
a'ah
ah
probably probably ya
mm
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear lah ah if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why ah what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside leh you look soft outside and inside you are eh fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it ah
adamant ah
oh okay okay okay
ya
mm
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also lah
ya
mmhmm
ya eh you know what dude actually what right uh one thing you should actually I recommend lah you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book ah dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that eh no no some people actually uh you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique lah then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a wah dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what lah but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good lah
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook ah and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F ah
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel um wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the mats can walk like that or the bengs they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
like whoa so big like they as if they got like big triceps ah that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also lah ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
oh really ah
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time lah ah
opening ah ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
a'ah then then then
I I think so ah why ah recall recall recall help me recall
oh ya okay okay then then then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
oi my memory very bad lah bro very bad bro mm
mm
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
ah
ya
ya
okay
something new ah
oo
okay ah
ya ya you can like transfer ah ya
okay
ha
flying ah mm
ah
okay
okay
okay
ya
mm
mm mm mm
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky ah that person should never have been a pilot sia but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
oh eventually they change lah when did they change
okay okay
mm
mm ya ya ya
okay
wah motivated like crazy sia
oh very young ah
ah
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
uh huh
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
mm
oh okay okay
mm
okay
okay
let go ah
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying ah you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly what okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay ah
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength ah ya ya ya
oh but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career lah it's more of like uh okay okay not not so much of a mistake lah not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
ah
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
ah
okay
ah
mm
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy okay
ya
ya
oh
a'ah
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
mm
okay
this was when ah
how you afford all these things man operation lah go lah
you loan ah
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
oi okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room ah
but you're
ya
ah who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
eh that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know ah it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no ah
just a cross ah oh okay
no you know why because I don't know lah it depends on my future lah because for now there's a lot of changes ah okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
dubai right dubai airline is it
oh
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience ah
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that lah
ah
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit lah ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry lah the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts ah
mm
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal ah
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
mm
wah how many airplanes sia bro like that
wah I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue lah like from steward to be flying lah okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is uh my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
oh you went through the three months ah oh it was supposed to be that stage already lah oh
wah dude that time if you fly ah your inter pretty stable and nice ah bro four to six K easily sia
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike ah
ya ya
walao I don't think that's anywhere close sia
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there sia on the drone
okay
that's relatable lah
ah okay okay so it's just a matter of time lah
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of mumammad salihin
ya then eventually when people see the peak ah lah it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession eh but okay lah but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
ya like for you you are like oh crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum lah so ya but but but no lah I I wish you all the best ah brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it lah it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field oh
mm
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him ah ya like before him right you see bush wah everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him ah the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman lah
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics ah in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no lah bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back eh okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that lah but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead mah like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks what the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people lah the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have genghis khan you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them lah you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that um people just have space to voice out things
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person lah how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now lah because if I go there I will die of boredom sia
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something lah but I'm not in touch with him that much lah
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old lah I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains ah then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom lah there's nothing to do sia there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know lah okay
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how sia
a plan ah
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business lah oh I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no lah basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay lah I will just give you a brief verbal presentation ah people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example oh bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why oh why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
ah
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much mah
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
they will just cut your utility lor
ya
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay lah you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people lah okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole lah which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor lah okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk mah you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan lah okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets lah you know you buy Rolex lah you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there mah
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions lah your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong lah but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example ah they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government uh supreme court order you to pay lah like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone lah that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
they have to stay in singapore ah
cannot ah
their their their passport is blocked what they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead lah you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go lah you know
ya
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you uh they cannot lah they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay lah they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy ah so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna uh work in production houses if the company feel like eh there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you lor private entity what
ah so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
ah like this kind of job ah the one that is got profile one ah they normally will not hire you one
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system lah ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests ah
ya lah for example okay I give you a scenario ah let's say you owe ten thousand lah the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred lah
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month lah okay
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial uh the debt trap ah okay so the second way is to pay a minimum eh

hi I'm okay
mmhmm
orh
all the way
oh wow
mm mm
mmhmm ya
oh wow
mm
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
hmm
err
and then they they said err depends ah ma'am depends I said huh
circuit breaker ya orh
mm mm
mm on that day itself ah orh okay okay
mm mm
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing seh it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job lah basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like uh mcdonald's then okay ya err like customer number one two three four and then they just say ah ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
mm
mm mm
mm
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business huh
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like huh
mm mm
oh my god really
is it because of circuit breaker
mm mm true lah
uh uh
mm mm
mm mm
huh
mm mm
thanks eh
ah maybe lah mm mm mm mm
so ang moh lah you know and then
ya but it's quite serious lah because I don't know
ah
mm eh
mm mm mm
orh
oh
mm mm okay okay
mm orh
mm mm
oh
oh my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
mm aedes correct ya
mm
most likely it is lah
mm mm mm mm
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat lah once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
mm correct correct
every other day sure got some story one
in the news both mm mm local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting sia I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like oh my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
crazy mm mm mm mm mm
huh oh my god
so scary
oh my god
mm mm fifty five
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya lah that's true lah mm mm it's a bit more controlled lah ah
mm mm true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know mm mm
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
natural garden ah
ya definitely definitely
mm mm
ya that's true
mm mm
ya lah I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like err quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that oh my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know lah I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like
is all that is not important seh
mm mm
I can't imagine how the businesses can survive man really like every other day don't you realise like a restaurant is going to close a business is closing down blah blah blah like walao like
I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about um you know using this reserves for
for all the I mean all these schemes lah like you said so
mm mm ya lor that's why funny ah
mm mm almost half a year lah
mm mm
ya that's on transport food ya
mm mm ya lah ya lah correct
mm mm mm mm
you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
mm mm
something that I don't know like
ya lah
correct correct correct or just do virtual lor everything nowadays virtual virtual event
but everything lah everything is now virtual lah like but it's quite actually interesting lah like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
ya that's true mm mm
endless seh like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also
shows so like imagine like recently they had like growing up you know money no enough
like you say lah they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
mm mm
mm mm
wah
funny ya
ya lah sometimes no choice is the best choice lah ha
mm mm
mm mm physical is no longer really needed lah ha
mm mm mm mm
ya lah but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
normal I guess you know
mm mm ya
ah wow amazing mm mm
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya lah mm mm
mm mm ya lah ya lah
mm mm cancelled kan oh postpone ah okay okay
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know lah I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
oh ya I think I saw that
mm mm
nature is healing ah mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
mm mm mm mm
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
mm mm mm
mm mm less is more
mm mm
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving what you know
mm mm
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it lah you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell lah oh okay mm mm hobby eh
mm mm ya that's true
ya lah must be positive lah because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done lah of course but can be done it can be done ya
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
true
standard ah
mm mm
I mean it's complaining is part of life lah you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
mm mm true very true
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely kan uh uh
ya
mm mm
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see eh
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like mm
mm mm

what issues they face
um when adhering to this err
this err err exercise programme ya
so it's like from err is like a assignment lah
ya
so ya lor that's been like
err what's been taking up the most the most of my time for the past two weeks
no ah I no time lah
like really like really just been about school mah the past the past like
don't know how many weeks
err considered moonlighting lah so they they don't want me to
work lah ya
just focus on school ah
then you eh you still at
orh
oh ya ya
then what he angry ah
a'ah
oh
oh ya ya
oh that's week three ah
orh
oh ya we have
the drive
clinical decision making
so that's like an assessment but that one quite fast like I also don't get why is it so fast ah they have so many groups to assess
oh but that one damn shag ah that one that one cause the previous assessment
me and darren never really do that well
so this one really have to buck up lah
then for
following the following week is
what ah week
week thirteen so that one is all the
is all the is all the one prac and one
and one paper
so that one also quite shag
uh ireland
no dude it's freaking
seven hours before us so now is three O three thirty so now there is
bro damn early sia
then like she say
a lot of us like tell her uh prof have a good rest
then she was like uh no uh I have class after this
then like bruh
ah ya no she
I mean
that also and like
and like wah she damn shag sia
like really ah but mad respect lah I think she's one of the better profs like
that this ya that ireland has to offer
like at least she like
explained her stuff compared to like all the other profs who like just give
and like you don't even know what they expect then this one she will specifically state like oh this thing that thing
ya
so which is good lah so we know what to expect
but sometimes she can be long-winded lah and repeat her stuff then that one like a bit sidetrack
err like midnight ah ya uh our midnight so it's like their five
around there ya
I mean it's not like their students staying up lah is
us
who are in a totally different time zone have to end up so they have to accommodate to us
wah shit then this weekend also like
then last weekend there was not football sia then
damn sian
ya
damn sian lah like okay but some of the scores were quite mad leh like the portugal one
ya sia
ah ya
wah sia you all
ya sia then just put jota up front what the heck
but man U also I don't know ah a bit on and off
like I watch also like doesn't feel like I want to be a man U supporter anymore
legit sia like that day I was I was watching the everton manchester game right
then like I thinking wah this one everton confirm win
and then everton lose then I what the heck
oh ya ya ya he tackle
oh he tackle maguire
but that one they he never they never give anything that one they let off I think
but wah that one hais I don't know lah
ya sia lucky this weekend got football if not
boring sia
your what who who
liverpool game I think
oh liver eh
really I I rather watch in the in the evening sia
ya lah I rather watch in the evening I I actually
I actually wake up to watch champions league games eh nowadays
that's how bored I am
oh dude it's tottenham and man city
this weekend still got err internationals
oh tottenham man city will be sick oh liverpool leicester also
wah shit
how to set up my team like that sia
eh got play or not
why you never play sia
will be fun I mean just need to set up the team then sua just leave it already
serious
but shah they all don't play meh terry they all
oh oh oh
you you stopped playing takraw also
hmm
dude there's a lot of kids at my neighbourhood just
gather ya not not just that like they play like there's group of seven or eight people then they just play badminton
play
takraw lah then like nobody care leh
I read like many it's it's like they don't give a shit lah
but then now now I feel like
singapore also quite stable lah so
you think will move into phase three or not
they say most likely before end of the year
so like
huh eighty per cent
of of what
oh then they will go into phase three
oh that's the incentive ah
sian
I mean just for that bit of freedom lah but then still need wear mask ah
ya they say is like
it's like won't be as what you experience
before like it won't be back to pre-COVID life lah definitely
but I just hope like there comes a point in time whereby don't need wear mask
damn hard to breathe sia sometimes
especially on hot days
hmm
but then
what to do is like that lor
oh you want to go
ah ya lah then I think need wear mask also right
I think so definitely lah that is also true
oh but then got a lot of the
actually I also kinda miss ah
but they selling all the they selling all the equipment online
like ya
but that is quite expensive sia
but then again is all used lah so I think the price is even cheaper but then other people use already sia you want to use meh
ya sia that's why
but I also
huh
but I also want to go back sia
wah that will be that will be the dream sia
huh
wait why are you in police uniform
oh the ah
oh ya ah
deepavali eh isn't deepavali on the fourteenth
ah oh that is true
oh ya ya
so you deployed to
to little india ah orh
eh you get you are that division
I always thought you at the woodlands one
ah
oh okay I mean that's more convenient lah in my opinion ya easier mah
wah then that yesterday I also talked with adrian
about like you know adrian is in
oh err TransCom adrian lah
he also went for shooting the other day
ya then he says he's damn busy now
ya supposed to be this week
but then they I told them
so they say okay never mind can come another time then like oh okay ah then they I think they reschedule me for
january ah january eight ya
next try will be next try will be when ah early of eh
eleventh of jan I think
ah oh damn
okay lah hopefully lah cause
the the one that they actually ask me to go now right is like
ya but I don't know why they ask me okay err thursday you come for then friday come for the shoot then like
why not just one shot
because I remember right like
is very fast also
it's not like takes a long time
oh
maybe ah
orh
I mean that would make sense lah is earlier
ah
been awhile since I go there also sia
eh no lah last time I went was for
wah that one shaggy
ya
ya
no now is cause of COVID right so now they make the
they make it err you so um one week
push-up all that right the person is
err standing away
from you
like maybe
ya then they count lor
but then err cause of this right there's no contact thing right then
err
there's no gauge for you when to
uh push-up until
so they say just make sure your
elbow ninety
and something else I forget already
ya then so is easier lah but then
ya sia true
you got try at maju ah
ah maju the
maju is very the the machine
the the what ah the
the track is actually shorter
like I don't know why but that day that day I like
screw up the the run eh the
the
uh statics because is all automatic
err when I use then I wah
why so hard then it always never detect
then like I needed like a ten ten to
ten ten to get silver minimum
then like wah I never run this fast before sia
even like our our trainee time right I think I run like ten ten thirty
ten thirty was my best
and that was like the most fit we ever been sia
then suddenly I run run run right like I didn't really care like tired or what then I run then suddenly ten O three then I like wow
ya I think adrian the one that told me the track is like very short
so like you won't you won't feel
it doesn't look like it lah but actually is
shorter I
think cause one thing is indoor
ya
so ya if you wanna like
if your statistics like not bad and then it's just your running right
then
you can consider maju lah
cause anyway very near like
you take one bus
ah
ah ya ya same same like maju lah
I mean
okay lor
sick wait with incentives is hundred right
then silver is three hundred then the max is
the max is five hundred lah the gold
wah but I never hit gold before
only that time sia when we were in
everyday right
ya
ah
uh huzaini eh that day I saw ben though
ya the the one who
screw us up
ya
he
block eleven
ah ya ya ya
I think so
I think
I think he's when he he got like C or something wah cui sia cause of that incident
but then
now he I think doing quite well ah
okay lah I think he took his job too seriously
but as a person outside I think he okay cause
uh he like
somewhat remembered me lah
then I just talk to him then
like I think he's studying at University of Buffalo
forget for what already
but I don't know why he was at though
it was like during the sports appreciation night

oops my bad oh marine parade east coast plan
ya he knows more about the squad than than figadi

huh he got ah
then again I always see his story every time got different girl lah
but I feel I feel like ya like
safi was more for us
was there more
compared to gary ah gary was like
ah ya ya
no lah
qawi
we got we kena him once or twice ya ya ya
when gary was missing then like needed like a replacement so
it was him
it was him then sometimes got qawi also cause I think
uh who's this safi was close to qawi
ya
no what I thought like we got him like
middle of the way
and then
is it okay really sia I thought he was there for quite substantial period
oh ya the ending
oh ya ya
then the ending was like very little stuff to do already I remember we just ya if really nothing do we just sit at the door
and then
eh you all want play football or not
in the end did we even play
I don't recall playing sia at the shack
I just remember the
the sports day you you got play you played frisbee right
oh you were right
oh halfway through you meet angus
oh oh right right
orh
oh is it

mmhmm
mmhmm
ya sia
ya sia I always felt isa should have gotten it sia
I I don't think he wanted it though
ya
hmm
in the end where he go ah
no no no uh isa
oh right ya ya ya
I always thinking I always thought it was command like not commanders like
but then that's nas karim
aqil umar ya
ya I think the four of them only but the four of them also I think were instructors
oh
oo
instructor ah
I always thought like what what would you be like if like
my experience was front line
cause I mean
I'm behind behind the scene a bit boring lah as in
okay lah lesser stress but then
no action also sian
like at least you all get to experience stuff like you got to experience stuff
you
no lah siao why talk about
there was one lah but it's damn lame it's not like it's not like your kind of standard like go go deployed for anything is like
is this is the police day parade is it
uh I think then it was at
marina stadium there ah then what they did was what I had to do was err
I just accompany them on the boat
and then just
do towards lor
wait I don't know what's this I forget already but then
I think home team show then they then all the people they just come onto
the boat
then they the my all the regulars
show them around make them
ya that was okay lah but then
I was deployed as a medic but then there was
nothing to do
okay lah
fudge
plaster
that was like legit like ninety percent of the time sia plaster
ya
eh then later what movie you all watching
orh that's the free ticket one you all got ah
eh I thought you had one extra ticket
or is that xavier
so you you xavier maria
who's joel
oh volleyball joel ah
oh at dhoby
oh ya that's true ah okay
what's what's the then what's this like demons layer thing about sia
is it like is it like like attack on titan
ya ya ya
right
is like at the start right all the it really caught me cause
is like
super dynamic the way they
put the like animation style then I was like wow this is quite
but then now the story like I don't know what's going on already
but then they say the final season coming out soon
ya ya
why
how is this
but I haven't like
but like read any manga before sia
got recommends
oh the comics but why you read sia
no as in as in what what what what what was it
now this
year still got what movie that's
marvel when you went there ya
I watch the new mutants not not that good sia
but that's
black panther eh
ah ya black widow I think
end of the year ah
the
the whole marvel scene
who fuck sia
wait why did this even happen like
how did this even happen
orh
no
orh
but now what he doing sia
is it
oh ya
after
I see serious
orh
I mean maybe it's just like the institutions lah
that's what he don't have
ya sia that one wah that one shiok eh
but
coney island ah
is literally coney island group
okay lah then we got one more year you want you want
eh no no no touch wood touch wood
go up
three to four hours right
huh no ah
I mean
you don't need to stand just
sit down and pedal
oh ya ya ya that's true I think one of my friends like
he he does this like
me and hasif got the gazelles team
the hasif
ya then we got the gazelles team then one of them now is like a fitness trainer then I think he does spin
class quite cool eh and
but sad lah like the club like
gone already like we stopped
stopped playing
but then I asked imran lah like if after
like all these phase whether like once
eleven eleven a side then maybe my team can
play against his team think would be quite fun lah
I miss playing football sia
why sia
orh
is the clutch game ah
well cause like approaching the end right I think
it was hard to find numbers lah then
then I think hasif just ask him
to fill in the numbers but then ya lah quite inconsiderate also seeing that like he come all the way down just for
five minutes but
maybe first second or third season second season we got like some good players but then
and it's just play amongst themselves and me lah so is like
unfair to others lah so I think they decided to leave
but that one safi jio
so then they stayed for long they were good lah but then ya just selfish lor
is that the start of this year ya ya the start of this year april march there
ya but I wanted to play sia
I sign up for captain ball
then I got the sport
because like I really wanted to play captain ball then uh I wanted to play the first year but then
it's either captain ball or
but then captain ball
I think there was too a lot of people then
not enough for football so I had to drop one then since
football not enough then I just join football
ya I was the keeper
clean sheet twice
first game concede second game clean sheet third game clean sheet
fourth game clean sheet
then final game
err think final game I think concede one
but the goal was damn stupid like
like the guy kick not even hard
but then it bounce bounce bounce right then I dived then it bounced over my hand
then go in then wah I tilted
I have no clue I think I think the way he hit the
ball not a clean strike
but then it was like
so it hit the ground then it bounce then it bounce then
I misjudged lor
but by then they all would have played at right
wah shiok sia wah shiok
that's why I was like hope really hoping like
hopefully the COVID won't get in the way
then at least
we get to play one more time lah before before like
before
year two okay lah year two was fun lah
you have to travel with caleb they all
actually I was quite lucky lah they get to travel that one
ya not bad ah
ya ya
bo pian lah so it's just like
you just go there then you learn about their healthcare system
get to know like they are how their
how the hospital works actually they all I was surprised sia like their
they quite
not say backwards lah but not as up to date as like singapore's kind of
like technology like their technologies still
quite old lah
ya maybe ya cause that one was up a mountain leh
but it was quite cool lah then
try soba then the
err we learn about
their stroke management actually their stroke patients like I think it's a japanese thing to be like super positive even though you are like phase three
those kind of adversity
ya so it was quite an eye opening experience
then like this year this year never go dublin right
so actually going that japan thing was quite good lah so at least some of the mods cleared
you all also supposed to have trips right
taiwan ah
korea
korea
but is just one week though
ya ya ya ah
cause like
I see the price right then like
for one week is it really worth it like I feel you can go
can go on a holiday for one week
at that same place with like lesser expenditure oh ya that is true
ya sia ya sia
how you got learn ah
what you learn
no no as in as in what you what recipe you ya
macarons
isn't that like super sweet or something
the capsule ah
orh
wah sounds tough sia
I do err during the circuit breaker at what they are
I mainly bake cake also pandan cake
err what other cake
err was it
butter
honey pound ah ya but then like
and all my like asked me like eh why you suddenly like start baking then like I got bored ah
but all the baking was just like just to relieve stress lor cause I think that period was also like exam period
ya then
ya lor that was like circuit breaker in a in a nutshell lah
it was just like at home doing nothing
actually it was quite therapeutic lah having that like time to myself also
oh ya that's true lah that's why a lot of people like
they did all the exercise stuff and all that then put on
story ya ya that was like the hype leh
you me no you did
oh ya ya chloe kept on trying lah I think dekai also kept on trying
oh ya lah
neighbours
actually mac and cheese I don't know why sia
because there was that time when err
my parents were overseas in new zealand right then like I had to
I had to cook myself lah for that one whole week
then I go cook mac and cheese thinking like it's gonna be damn easy then I
I don't know how I screw it up sia then I eat right I can still the taste the flour eh
ya maybe ah probably probably
wah but that one whole week was quite
shiok ah having the whole house to myself
which was the best
what was the best recipe like
whether is solid
actually is like the recipe and the ingredients like all so simple but then when you actually get down to it right wah is actually
ya
but the
ah ya you use what
mmhmm
mean
I think I use parmesan parmesan cheese
I think it was not bad
but I also use it to make this pasta recently
I think I made with fifi
then like he teach me how to like
make make what's this thing called
make err the mushroom more meaty ah
so like he when he cook the mushroom like he grill not grill ah
he pan fry the mushroom but he put like he put like err
butter on the pan first
then after that he put the mushroom
then he let it sizzle for awhile then he put salt
because the salt will like take out the
err take the moisture out
draw the moisture out cause when it's frozen right a lot of it is trapped inside mah
then after that he will
he will take
oh what he do after that ah oh ya then he will take
err like this
press it then
err so you will take out all the moisture wah then we make
we use that to make like cream pasta wah damn nice sia
actually next time right if like after all this
like if can go each other house then
you all can come then we can try to make it together
ya
I feel like cooking also
ya ya ya it's just like how you
oh right right right
ya cause nowadays also sometimes my mum will fast
so like I think
which days ah which days normally fast ah mondays ah I think
then like she will tell me okay help me taste because I fasting
then like okay
ya then I agree with you lah like
cooking really on feel one like
no matter like even the recipe said state like like this like this like this right but end of the day right I think feel
or like the passion
for cooking is more important

the later the machine listen too dirty ah all the drama we talk about
like you like it
mm
oh okay carry on
eh where's your phone right now
are you talking in the direction of your phone
okay
I I I don't know just now I was like looking off a bit I was like looking to the side I scared I scared it was a bit too soft
okay I hope sial I hope it's alright
ya it's like that lah
um
okay then
why what did she say
is it really a is it really even even a break up
ya lah because honestly he like how to say say uh he says like back then like oh we're not together you know like we're just friends
but they act like they are together but the whole point of a relationship is the act lah not the just the label so basically he he was together actually because he like spend all the time with her
like they eat together then hang out together it's basically like dating lah even though he doesn't want to say that it's dating but the fact that it actually is what it is isn't even if he denies the the label and doesn't want to put the name on it
it is what it is you know
to what
when when was this
they will just they will just we'll we'll you and me will be third and fourth wheels eh no the thing is right they say they say they are not dating but they totally act like they are dating remember they do all those cringey things in front of us
haiya you know I don't know lah
like you know when when friends in like when two people in your friend group go date each other then they break up that just sucks lah it's like
it's just annoying I think it's just like why you all got to date each other can you just find somebody else outside your friend group
but that's what I want I think like if I want to find I'll just find someone out of my friend group cause like it's so annoying right like there's some some like friend groups will fracture because of a break up of relationship inside their friend group
shut up lah to shut up okay
shut up lah
just shut
okay
anyway err oh ah did you get your polling station place that you assigned to for the job
no the one that you for the job

there's so like there's different there's different
what do you call it different

I said start elite
difference different how you say different models different
ah ah a bigger sample group ya a biggest sample group will make for a more effective
study ah whatever lah

oh what did you eat today
you buy the bee hoon or did you cook
your mother
I woke up today I didn't even eat
err I woke up and then I eat at seven o'clock
ya
so I only had like one meal today
ya man
I think tomorrow I'm supposed to go out tomorrow is sunday right eh no today's friday
sunday I'm supposed to supposed to go meet adela and menaz
I can't be bothered lah
no uh the part with adela I'm just like
uh you know
what do you mean
no adela wants to meet us because she just broke up
she has but I uh I don't know I think she wants a guy guy's opinion I don't know
what is against her
cause she's cause she's being stupid that's why
it's not it's not the fact no I feel like it's just it's not her it's not just like girls it's it's her okay
it's like
she does okay she has a lot of problems
wow
the ah I already told you what that time feel a bit lazy to say
no like she has such a
she has such she's such a bad unhealthy view on relationships
like she so she's so disgusting how she treats she expects a guy her boyfriend to treat her like she she like keep saying like oh I I want a boyfriend so that he can buy me free food
eh you know all these all these movement by girls like all men are trash all men are trash kill all men you know what girls are actually trash also
no ah you're not lah
that's why I don't say all girls are trash ah like the the the the the phrase
but you know girls are equally trash also like I when I hear adela talk about how what her what her ideal guy is like damn disgusting sial
like she keep saying about
um she keep telling telling us like oh I want a boyfriend so he can buy me free food like so she can buy he can buy for me err clothes and I can take his clothes
it's like it's so materialistic and it's so like you know like she's like using the guy to spend on her
I think she's um
teachers and I think she's a middle class like okay
as a student in singapore you're basically poor that's what you are but she lives in a maisonette
and her father drives audi A five I think
ya but
I but you know that's the thing like okay your parents may be rich but you are not rich you know what I mean
unless like your they constantly give you money and like
ya that's still their parents money like once you're
like once you're how to say you want to marry or something or you move out the house
like are they really going to keep giving you money
she's stable lah
because she has that's exactly that's what I'm saying we keep saying men are trash girls are also trash okay
exactly and then that's what girls always say no lah uh when the girl's the exception they say uh no lah she's just the exception exception like
like eh enough
black lives matter
no she's not
no she too dense to think about it
sometimes no lah she doesn't
shut up
okay she's not attitude problem but she's just very bimbo to associates
and and then it's okay when back in secondary school when you're still a very young girl
but now that you are twenty two or twenty one is become has become very
like
just grow up you know what I mean like
you're supposed to be like matured already and
think about other people and like not have this kind of views but she's the same old adela from secondary school
uh it's just I think it's just
mostly down to herself
because if you you can't blame your your your your ex for
behaving a certain way also what like the only reason why you don't develop because you don't want to
mature yourself and like grow up you know I mean
how I know tinder instagram I don't know
what else man
nowadays nowadays is all
it's slide sliding to the arms
what
ya you see afiq now he wishes if he he doesn't have a boyfriend uh girlfriend
ah I I I I hope that they can resolve their issues
ASAP
but ya rashal's like keep asking me to go meet and then I'm like I don't know whether I can
actually I said okay how about tomorrow then I was like I don't know because by right I have the meeting what the filming for
so
they they also never update us about the situation but I think as of now like got nothing there's no venue
you're not allowed to
huh
no way I
wait they didn't tell me anything
wait if that
that means they won't have the
the materials
ah I check after
after this lah
I don't want to make extra tippy tapper tippy tap noise ya tippy tap noises
that's why so maybe she wants to talk about it I don't know
a'ah maybe
no lah no lah I don't think so also lah but I don't think I don't think so lah like I didn't think you I didn't even think she wanted to talk about it until you you mentioned about the filming
who's asking to meet you also
oh what was I going to say ah oh ya she wanted to invite syakif also syakif and irfan to come
dude ugh uh ah ya azuleen azuleen over
what's your
what's your ya it's it's so it's so dead nobody knows I don't know
what
you're not what you're not you're just jealous of us
you wish you had you wish your group was this hype
no you you just think because you see from the outside you like eww but then I bet I bet if you were like inside the group if you confirm like oh ya azuleen is the best I like I like
you're just jealous bro okay I'm not the
I I might I might end up um going
I just because they are like very on so I just might end up just going east coast park with them and cycle with them
cause the rest all useless
no they're supposed no they're supposed to help me ya like okay then they're like no it no it's not it's not okay cause I need to know
when there are free like if you tell me a date like you know how how like if I if I suggest something then let's say like
everybody say okay then the one person who didn't reply suddenly say oh I cannot on this day then why you never tell me in the first place
who says like whatever you can just message me it's like
there's like no no no
then err that's why I just like just leave it lah never
I never go plan lah I just like ah whatever lah you all don't want to go then I also don't want to go uh I go with somebody else
you know did syazwana what
okay lah I don't know I don't even oh ah actually you know I don't even I don't even like
really like vibe with them like you know like vibe vibe with them
but at this at this rate I'm just like whatever I'll just like do it lah
whatever it is I'll just try
oh I might not you know I'll just like
basically what I'm saying right now is also just to fill up the
right whatever I'm saying right now is just to fill up the conversation so so sometimes I'll just say bullshit but you know it's not actually
just trying to fill up the the one hour
why does it feel why does it feel so much harder to like talk about
ya
or we can sing another thing we can sing okay lah sing oh no it's not singlish what if we sing
we are
okay then
are you kidding me
are you kidding me she has five bikes from who from where
oh my god dude I will go with faz and you
and afiq okay forget about amar okay if amar don't want to go
why
what
but he's been working so much
this is just one time and it's not even that expensive dude
no but the the thing is if he wants to rent that that tricycle thing it's way more expensive than renting a bike you know so it makes no sense
a double bike is way more expensive than a single bike okay it's not even like because it's double bike it's two times it's not
okay you can just ride on your own so I don't think that's the case
and and also and also
also he
when I talk about the food then he want to go
so what it just doesn't add up
are they all adult size
where is her bike where she live
how we supposed to bring jurong jurong west bikes all five of them to
west coast has uh is there any does it have a good cycling
because I know one is very good
are you mad
I I don't I don't mind lah but I haven't exercised in so long I think I can pass away
I scared like one as I I just one the like the chances of
one out of the five of us probably will have like
hey guys I cannot already
you know ah west coast west coast east coast is
it's going to take a whole day you know
um
I want I want I want I want I want I want to go I want to go
okay then I just ask afiq
that
but does
does fazirah want amar to come
okay so so if anything just four of us ah
huh really ah
really
I don't want I don't want
I know but
is not huh
how do I put it
I wouldn't be comfortable
like like like okay I'm sure he's a he's a nice dude and stuff but
not like I don't not like him just that
it'll be more awkward and I'll have to like
ya
okay lah
you all somebody has to plan it's always like
it's always like when somebody says something like I want to go here then everybody is like oh ya ya okay I ons I ons everybody ons then nobody plan
it's not my bike so faz has to plan it
ya

serves them right
is it
I think ya the last five minutes right we try to speak malay
cause I scared got not enough malay
it's now forty nine thirty three for me what's yours
forty nine forty now
okay same
eh I feel really good about liverpool ah about man city beating liverpool
cause liverpool suck ah
they won already they won already
but man city beat them yesterday
no it's just a
no it's they won the the match
you understand but they didn't win the league
no okay a league how you win the league how you win the league
is that
you will
there's like thirty plus teams in the league right
so
you have your home and away matches
so basically uh you will fight every team at home so means your stadium and then you will go to their stadium and fight them again
so a win means three points
you your team earns three points
a draw means one point
and a lost is zero points
so basically
you have like sixty plus matches
in the league right
because it's just thirty times two what
so
you try to
collect the most points
err then the most points win lah win the league
so it reaches a point where hello
okay so they it liverpool reached the point in the
in the season where they
where they mathematically uh mathematically no other team can beat them on points
so that means they reached high enough far enough that
even if the second place team wins all the the rest of their remaining matches their points their point tally cannot go above
liverpool's
err point tally
so that's why they won the league
ya so they they want to win the league early lah so so to speak
it's it's fair lah as in like they were good that means they won it already that means they were they were good lah
ya it's fair
no how is that not fair how is that not fair
it's fair
ya
but so so liverpool already won the league
and then
err but you still have the remaining matches what
to be played
to be played
you cannot cut the league short because
even though first place has been decided second third fourth fifth sixth all the way to thirty has not been decided
eh wait I'm not sure how many teams there are I think is twenty four oh my god not thirty ah forget ah forget how many matches there are but you get what I mean
so oh my god wait it's not even thirty I think it's like sixteen or eighteen
can't be that many teams in a league
okay wait I think it's like
nineteen teams ah or some or forty or twenty teams ah twenty plus teams lah not thirty plus
so is twenty plus teams okay so
it was like so like you cannot stop the league at when the first place when the first place has been decided what
cause you need to find out who can come second third fourth fifth all the way to twenty plus all the way to the last right
and then the the three last teams will get relegated
they go down a league
they go to a lower division league
it means you don't compete in the premier league anymore
and then
the one in the lower division league their top
three
if I'm not wrong top three their top top three teams will go up to premier league
ya
so
that's how a season works
how's it so hard to understand
okay uh right now it's like fifty four
err
mm uh
oh
sempurna dan
okay what is sentence in malay
ah
ya then
um
berbual dalam bahasa melayu yang baku
like it's like compartmentalized already my brain like if I speak
like formal malay like no english words will accidentally go in but if I speak like
slang malay like accidentally english words you just go inside
like unconsciously
I think I know what you speak malay I speak english
is or or we can can we even do that
is it is it alright like
but they said
err speak in full sentences
of malay
as in you are speaking full sentences
what do you mean by you make a lot of some
you know what forget it let's just stop speaking speaking in malay anymore
but that was not bad lah huh
my malay not bad what just now
but it's still proper what
what do you mean it makes sense
eh should we stop now
okay you just continue your continue your thing
they're always hiring dude
like almost all the time
as a what as a keeper
don't want lah
ah are we going to stop the recording now
okay let me check the instructions see what
you keep talking
to just fill up the the the conversation lah
I think we can just end it lah ah
okay press the red button okay ya on the count of one on one okay like just now okay three two one

and this is wafaidil
pretty good you know and it's uh it's been an eventful weekend I've been spending a lot of family bonding time with my family uh spending I just spend today at the beach in sentosa and
and cause we had a lot of free time and considering it's gonna be another stressful week of work or study err this coming week
we just wanted to spend this last day of the weekend you know just playing around the sand throwing each other into the sea spending quality family time
what about you hady what have you done for this weekend
um personally I wouldn't say that it's insignificant lah I'm just gonna say that
there's a little room to improve cause as of now
unless innovation is kicked in and newer ways are produced
we can't really get any better cause it's already it already seemed flawless ah
and now it's just depends on like what are the different types of features being added to the newer phones and how important are these features and how frequent are they being used in our daily lives how does it improve the quality of life I would say that is one criteria that big brands such as apple should instill lah looking for newer features that can improve the daily quality of their customers
um one question I would like to ask you would be
do you think a phone should cost around
a thousand cause the new iphones I've seen when walking past those apple stores
were actually around a thousand ah for the iphone eleven max pro what do you think of the price tag and do you think it's worth it
um in terms of the mask in this hot weather we can't really do anything to
minimise its effect on us ah cause we always have to ensure that we have our mask on on public transport in our offices when we conversing with our perhaps colleagues and friends and
there's no way around it ah it's always err prioritizing our own safety over such comforts like ah fighting off against the heat ah and but what I would suggest
for you to keep up with this heat is to always drink a lot of water
okay my
um me personally I've been living with having to wear spectacles ever since I was a kid lah and
me as being someone very err
very err
I would say
fair on what I spend my money on
I feel that spectacles should be free ah cause I didn't ask to be born with err bad eyesight and
this is some this is a necessity to ask to contribute to the workforce so I think that it should be free for us to
you know see properly do better jobs at what we do
and yeah
that is something I could agree on ah for you know countries like switzerland providing eh countries like sweden sorry
countries like sweden providing free healthcare for their um their people and hopefully one day countries like singapore can also err adopt that err value of err taking care of their people's health lah
and providing certain free services for like I would say certain be better cause
err we do not we don't want to put our country in debt cause of the supplies needed for this medical you know and
I would like to ask you another question hady um
it may be seem out of context but um if you could have one superpower what would it be
mm after much consideration of like
ah me personally being someone who cares about my self image and what other think about me
I think I'd go with mind reading you know cause
is like you know whenever you go through your festive seasons you do your house visiting I just want to read the minds of the aunties inside the household and just like
think ah do they have a good image of me do they secretly have a secret hatred towards me cause I eat too much at their house
ya then you know it's a certain sentimental reasons just to
I just want I just want to read how people think about me and like
what they go through in life
how much better of a person I can cheat I can be towards them
to stop treating them badly understand their situation deeper detail cause I'll be reading their mind lah through through their eyes lah basically seeing their lives through their eyes
and you know that mind reading ability might come to might be useful for me during like exams cause sometimes you know you run run you run into hard eh hard questions which
you kind of overlooked when you were studying and you didn't know how to do so
why not mind read the smartest student who is just a few chairs away from you right
and get that higher mark ah and hopefully and through that
enter good uni you know
err back to you hady
you can just listen from afar right
hmm
ya yes of course you know err
throughout the our daily life you always think about a bit sometimes weird stuff that just passes by our mind and we don't want to err give off a wrong image to the person reading our mind lah cause
we show what we want to show to people we don't want to show them what we don't want to show
cause we know it's not right but it's still being processed in our brain so ya lah
ah
where you see something once
um this is useful cause when you're studying and you have to flip through so many pages from your textbook
and having this photo memory you can instantly pick it up
so as you as you're when you're doing your exam
this image will straightaway just pop up in your brain and you can copy word for word giving them the model answer
the second skill I would have to say would be hmm I've always been a big fan of gordon ramsay so probably cooking ah cause
err food is like such a wonder to this work there's so much unique taste there so much unique
err ingredients to be explored
ya unique fusions so me myself being able to learn how to cook really like
drives me lah to try out different things different you know different cuisines and learn them cook them in my ah
at at my convenience with my own mix ya
as for the third skill I would say right
is
being able to
make friends with anyone
err I feel that being social is quite important in my life cause like
err
I'm err I always have to interact with people in school in work
in in my own household err and um
somewhat lacking in the social department lah cause
err it always seem like I just don't mix well with people and
err
we just uh interested in different things lah
so that's just me and my err life relations lah
you know
hmm me being a mobile phone kind of person whenever I do turn on the to watch
it would have to be either action
or stuff that is animated lah cause the movies like with actions or animations
are deeper appreciated if you view them on the bigger screen cause you view details that you would miss out on a small frame of a phone so with this big frame you notice every single detail every single ah intricate detail of like
explosions um err hidden features like like
somewhat of sudden appearance
um if
my favourite action movie would have to be the expendables ah cause
err
nearly all my favourite actors ah actors and actresses are in there my idol
err there's also
err people like
err rocky ah
ah he's always I've I recalled seeing him when whenever I was a child my parents would play his movie ah
ya I totally agree with you on your last point but I also
I would like to disagree with you about the romance ah
for me personally I feel that romance plots are always the same it's always the hero save the damsel
and then they just fall in love and get a happy ending
which is always being overplayed overplayed overplayed cause people want that idealistic ending and I feel like movie movie director should make a more
um diverse type of ending for example one of the lovers dies coming to the ending or like
ah the lover finds another lover you know to create different emotions lah of
in a love lah
honestly I would always go for my celebrity crush ah
mister johnny depp he has a very err mysterious unpredictable vibe towards him with his smoldering looks
you know he he just a hottie ah I would say
err but recently I've been hearing that he's been abused
by his err former wife eh ah by amber heard
it's kind of sad lah I just wish him the best ah
you
hmm so you're telling me you would rather be ryan gosling over johnny depp
who in the past has know been known for
you know dating a lot of beautiful girls over
this newcomer ryan gosling
or perhaps oo because of sentimental reasons you say cause he relates to you
similar ah I relate to um my johnny depp cause you know
well
on that note
I can agree with you cause I've always been scared of ants and as you know ants always come in pax
and that has always been one of my fears growing up or being bitten by multiple ants so
when you say a hundred otter sized horses
an otter is not that small but that would be scary cause I would be overwhelmed whereas if I had to fight an
horse sized otter
I mean a horse is pretty big but
it's not an like an elephant big
so
ya I think I can I could somewhat stand a chance more more
to the
compared to the small otters ah eh small horses ah
knowing me right
I think that
if I were to put stuff inside time capsule
it would be
green tea ah
cause I've been drinking that ever since primary school ah
and then such a you know a singaporean drink
every single day auntie
one green tea ah and it's always so cheap you know it's like one one twenty one ten
ya and ah another item I would say is probably
hmm
probably a note to myself from the past err you know lah
when you're in the future you're in the past
you always want to know lah like what's your future self
err you you always want to ask yourself how you're doing ah basically a reality check from the past ah
and the third item I would put in there would be something that could last long
or gain in value like perhaps
for his rolex you know
put it in a time capsule you know so for fifteen years for example
it has not been touched that rolex has been inside that box
who knows what the value could be by then you know it might be more it might be less but hopefully it would be more lah cause
ah as for you hady what would you put inside
you could say we have
you could say we have pretty similar taste ah putting a note together
take ah
you want me ah one what do you have another question you would like to ask me
if if I had three wishes ah
honestly
me being me
I probably wish for a hundred billion dollars ah people say money can't buy happiness
but not for me ah
how does that not make you happy
and I could also own
um like big houses by the ocean
and give them one to each of my siblings
for their families
so
I don't see why money can't buy happiness you know
these sentimental reasons are like
these big purchases can like improve our quality of life so
deeper appreciation for each other you know
as for the second wish right
ah I would honestly
wish for an air conditioned shirt
so that when cause singapore's weather is so hot nowadays
literally the moment you step out
you start sweating
so an air conditioned shirt
would be so useful in our day and time ah
of course err
you just keep your whole body cold you'll be more energetic
err ya you can just run about your day without having to be drenched in sweat having to worry about smelling bad
you know
quite a useful item to wish for to be honest
and as for my third wish I would
probably ask for
for me to hold my own concert lah
um me being me I've heard myself sing in the toilet a few times and
you could say I can hit them notes ah and
uh I've always idolized this K pop stars ever since I was young so I inspired to have my own concert with
people rushing over to see me perform
so ya those are pretty much
the three things ah that
I would wish for ah
okay
that's me with me that's me with the questions done how about you hady
what would you wish for
um those are very good wishes ah your first wish makes me err seems like a very stingy person and selfish ah cause
you'd wish for people to gain an access to an unlimited amount of money right
and whereas I prioritize myself ah
and as for your second wish I
really hope you could amend that ah cause who would want to be the owner of such a
buy in team and with no history
so no point supporting and being an owner of a team that has no backbone ah so if you could
I would suggest you err be the owner of liverpool instead ah
fair enough ah
oh that is very easy
that is very easy
for me
personally
I will eat nasi lemak
cause
uh actually no I will take back my I will take back my answer
the remainder of my life ah
probably nasi ayam penyet ah
it literally has all components I need ah
it has vegetables you know sometimes they put cabbage under the
fried chicken
they always give like slices of potatoes
ah there's always cucumber which is good
err of course lah the primary part ah
of course lah the
um primary part
of the dish of nasi ayam penyet which is the fried chicken
which is a great source of protein you know
and
pretty balanced meal for me to continue being happy and with my body ah
ya
so
if I could eat one dish
so hady if you could eat one dish what will you eat
hmm
quite quite a good reason sentimental I've went for the well balanced route you've went to
your mum's cooking which is
what what we eat daily
day to day like right now but
okay I would like to ask you one question
if you could
what is your ideal job
that you wish you be doing in the future
ya you can choose any job you want
I would want to be a
err I would want to run my own radio like um
have you heard of the malay podcast called
okay let's go
yes that's something that I have
really been look look up to lah cause these three guys are
literally talking about the issues in singapore
without restrictions
they literally just
talk without boundaries cause
they have no limitations they speak on real problems
highlighting what
highlighting ya highlighting the problems
what could be done to um
err prevent such things from happening again
and they just a wonderful bunch ah they very humorous
and
that ah that just quit their nine to five jobs and just
ah started a podcast which became singapore number one podcast is just
wow
if only I could do that with two other people
with someone budgeting us
um another job that I would be
probably the law law sector ah
err
giving people that deserve judgement
the fair judgment ah
that give him the proper um
punishment
they can be bought off ah
err you know there's always speculations that
judges are very biased nowadays for like
the cases
you know
just cause they have a four point O
they get excused from molestation
record people showering like
does that even makes sense ah
just cause they have a potential bright future
they can do all these nonsense I don't think so
then
ya I would try to be I would try to prioritize lah
justice ah over anything
and for my third job ah
honestly I would want something social lah
so perhaps
err
a singaporean tour guide
I've always been you know
pretty excited on meeting new walks of life in singapore
and you know just conversing
knowing what they like about singapore what they don't like
we have to know lah cause we we be pretty egoistic if we don't
want to know what they don't like us
maybe we can improve from there
and you know we can learn what unique about singapore
and in
meeting new people has always been a
err err a hobby of mine which I like ah cause you know
you have more friends
you learn more cause you're you've open up to more people
and different people act differently ah so
you would probably learn you know how
how people act
and adjust yourself accordingly lah if the people macam
you can learn
how to deal
back to you hady
hmm
for me personally
from what I've seen ah
eh
sorry sorry sorry I would like to take that back
I would like to say that good looks are more important than a fit body ah cause
err I've seen a lot of malay girls cause I malay
err I've seen a lot of malay girls fall for guys simply for their looks
they could be as skinny as a board
and they would get
you know
um
um
good looks over that one ah
cause they also keep in mind that they want
they want to have like a good face so that
you don't get bored of them ah easily
apart from their good personality
there's also the complimentary of a good face
that's what they say ah how about you hady what you think
there there's no point if you have good looks
out of the two options I would if only I could slot in the choice of personality oo then that's what I would choose lah primarily ya stick to good looks lah
okay err passing back to me I would like to ask you a question
why do you think the number one leading death cause for young people in singapore is suicide
why do you think so
it's all happening very fast and sometimes we don't have the time to like to comprehend and adjust to it ah so ya all these build up pressure would be
kind ah um kind ah does a heavy toll on us ah
ya and it's it's sad to say that personally I feel that in asian household
they just avoided ah like what you said it's like a taboo in our household
it is it is rarely talk about cause ya when our parents were growing up
they never really consider themselves they always thought of the consequences for example so what if their jobs were stressful
is better than being jobless
err raising awareness lah I would say err to this type of issue ah back to you hady
oh
hmm ya I agree with your statement
this that that change must be must happen we have to strive for more supportive family it's about supportive background you know
ya err okay time to turn err time to turn to happier pastures ah from this depressing err fix err
what would like to ask you right
about some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
ya
um
as a singaporean something that I can be proud of and appreciative is
our public transport lah
I would say we have the best public transport cause
our buses nowadays are very clean very fast and
with the introduction of err electrical buses
very green ah
I would say we've been making an effort to reduce carbon monoxide err you know
to play our part in keeping singapore green country
and ya something that I'm proud of being singaporean is I think an effective and also green public transport
yes of course hady we talked about certain questions and

so hello I'm I'm went from the toilet ah sorry ah for the wait
so like
ya what what were you doing ah meanwhile
ya ya ya ya oh ya it's sedap mania oh cheap ah really got what flavors over there I feel like going there again tonight leh
oh
bestnya
oh ya adam I think most likely ah
he will be coming
ya ya most likely now he's taking a rest to to power charge himself for later
ya
ya
ya so
oh oh
oh ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive lah
thailand
um ya so
I see I see
ah ya
ah
ya
adam needs more convincing to do lah
ya
err anyway
K
hmm
oh ya hor eh but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says err um
have you heard of ah what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like chicken chicken and all
so one is for one dollar
we never go at there maybe we can go there lor check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces wah shiok sia
actually we can two person share one what one person six piece six dollars okay sia right
ya so
satay sauce soup base I was like wah that's kind of cool then maybe we can
mm mm
oh
me ya
I I also don't know lah I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
so
hold a lot of shares tau so I think
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
ya um
um
mm
I see I see
but how much ah the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
mm
ya ya
new um way
so
so
right kan
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity lah because like you know um
eh not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward lah for
that's why I think err
ya possibly because um even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
um maybe there's one thing we can consider lah
so ya
ya so
ya
so um
mm
okay um
I okay
I will try my very best to convince him to go
ya
there also the vibes like very nice you know
mee sua
ya I mean
ya worst come to worst me you adam
ya
ya
ya but the cheapest is two dollar per fifteen minutes
ya
ya
okay um
ya so
ah ya lah
um
so um
okay so we can review about I don't know
business ideas
huh
ya
ya
I don't know lah
oh oh your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
oh okay okay
oh
oh
oh
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine ah
I I'm wondering uh honestly curious
oh interesting eh psychology
wah
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify kan
ya so maybe lah it's the it's the same person lah loves animal right
a lot of careers ya
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
oh mother's gossip
uh maybe we should help lah we should help please tell
so um it's important lah to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized lah in
ah ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday lah
ah sentosa is it
that's how ah we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
so um sentosa maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar ah
you know we can just hang around at sentosa sentosa I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts lor
ah yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort serapong can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say lah they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
oh ya ya how much is it ah
I'm not too sure I really don't
oh ya we can do that also uh I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
err um can lah I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
ya as in eh as in the the timing also lah
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
can also lah because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
err let me see eh err
three rides one blue one orange one green thirty five dollars
I I don't quite understand
so many rides lah but I think it'll be different
madame tussauds
ya green zone so green zone and orange zone one ride is ten token
twenty err twenty token
okay um
hackett the jumping one right fifty five token
there is uh another one ah gogreen segway the segway it's only five token for
thirty minutes one hour ten token by pedal bicycle
ya I think it's okay ten token worth it one hour seh one hour we can it's a very long time lah not bad seh
ya don't have their have eco adventure but I don't think there is kayak
we can take cable car if you want cable car is twenty token
mount faber and sentosa and it's a round trip
so you can take it from mount faber
budding air
ya lah we can oh got mega adventure park um
ya so we ten ten so we get to take err two different attractions lah which I think a bit quite nice eh some more plus cable car then after that
ya eh what is mega bounce mega bounce
bike
aiya I guess not too sure but okay lah we can check there out we can check that out some more I mean we are not paying you know technically it's free so let's just do that
so I mean we we can see lah what else we want but I think to really maximise the segway is good because it's at whole one hour then I think
there will be a tour guide so then you can like literally explore a lot of places in sentosa just by the segway
ya so okay lah so nineteen nineteen so which is this sunday right this saturday right
err
it is the nearest station is tiong baru
and I am like wow not bad not bad not bad interesting
oh eleven to fifteen december

stephen stephen chow
ah
a'ah
ya
it's true ah
it makes sense ah cause like I mean like
it's not written anywhere tau
but that's the funny thing like a lot of people say french people are more romantic kan but at the same time french people are much more open
uh huh
ya
and how we are actually romanticised by all these things that humans
we believe it's such negative which actually weakens us tau
okay lah
a'ah
but for us we assume he know and second thing we assume that he will get offended
we expect that from an adult but when it comes to baby kan
one week of work
like that towards my wife as well that kind of thing lah cause
this kind of thing ah
ya
ah yes yes yes
ya
ah
ya
mm
there's no
they are left on their own ah
but
a'ah
ya
err
ah it's either you want a it's either you listen to podcast

ya
mm
find a better take ah how can I make it a better err circumstances or whatever ah
they just say I also have problems so how now
ah
ah
ah
mm
a'ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
oh
come on ah this is this is to to sound controversial ah it's recorded but whatever ah eh
a'ah malaysian
a'ah
ah
mm
ah
ah
to a certain extent I agree with ragging cause it toughens a man
like
kids kan okay if you are rich

a random question you know what is like you know what is really out of this world ah these questions like literally out of this world
if you
could be
an animal what would you be and why have we
I don't know I'm still thinking of my answer now
a giraffe
that is so unlike your current scale
yes
reaching yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they're like very different than other animals but also elephants are quite different
have you elephants much or more loving detail
ya that what I was thinking
eh
just over there
mm
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also lah
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
ah how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
ah about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time oh wow yet
amazing ah
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
want to stab yes
oh please ah
ya
I can be anything I want
I want to break free
wah what would I want as in do I want to be a non-living thing
I don't know meh
but I guess a non-living thing can also be anything they want
like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
mm
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this
okay what do you want to be
what do you mean
like a super super power like a superhero
um I don't even have to have a superpower taffy mention
like you don't grow old
oo and just excel in it
that would be cool then like my laptop wouldn't be smelling like matcha now
mm
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be
like you only can have this one superpowers um
mmhmm
transportation eh
sure
it's at the back of my head
teleportation

and then she had to tap her legs like
what is one skill that you wanted to learn though
that you always want to learn but you haven't learnt yet
E two
investment
stock
stock trading

but it's so like hectic though
I thought I will get migraine

mind opening
ya
actually I don't know how it works also
but you have to call it and then like someone just get high ya I don't know
that is very fascinating
oo
nobody thinks about
what do I think about your
I think it's a cool skill to learn I'm not sure whether it will be useful
but
it's cool
ya
ya ya ya
that I want to learn
hmm
I feel like I'm quite talented
but I mean
of course there's a lot of things that I don't know also
I want to learn how to
do investments
no really really that's what I really want like I'm I'm very like because I feel like at this age
a lot of my friends are like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know
how to do it and like or
like you know like
what are the right ways to do it lah basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow
ya
I mean I do have like
investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me
I want to grow I want to grow grow grow

I mean if I think about it lah it's a good life to live but
ya it's just managing your mental health

if I could be a drink I would like to be a teh cino

first but then once nope I could be bitter at first but then once you reach the bottom I could be really sweet

twenty four
mm
mm
two of her oldest sisters there
mairah was with us
but she she is one
but ya got see the two sisters lah there
I was
I was twenty two I think
mm
before on the month
mm
eleven
mm
my last trip was langkawi
is it
I was only nineteen ah as in like flight flight kind
okay that's it for now

so how you today nas
oh ya
ya ya ya I I also been watching Netflix lah
oh favourite eh
oh right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no lah
but they still do watch the anime ah
but
err cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
uh september twenty nineteen
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
orh ya
exactly
oh
ah
oh
ah at the sorry ah at the mountain right
oh ya
wah
so
does that mean ah in the future will be a demand also
oh ya
orh ya that one is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six eh wah he's really strong
ya
such coward
wah
man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
but but
it really blews me away ah blows me away sorry
ah opening ah
mm
mm ya
ya
it's like err one thing good about anime is like there's no
ah pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of certain events in their life
um
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
mind blowing ah legit
ya
ya
ya
um
mm ya
uh one piece
ya
oh ya
not too much
it's it's uh it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
orh ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
exactly cause that's why I I always ah
I always envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for ah films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
ah ya
ah ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
oh ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take oh wait no other than that got physics lah but that's all lah physics should be simpler because this one
its pre-calculus sia what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
oh is it the
the position vector eh
wow
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
ya so err ya that's why exactly but okay lah the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you err encounter like many problem solving ah methods or like
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me ah because one thing um
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with um other people or like
uh actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to ah do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like mm I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
mm
ya
uh ya ya
mm
that sounds
crystallisation thinking eh
wow
mm
mm
uh soft skills that they're born with
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill lah but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
uh your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood lah in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own uh thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you ah in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
uh you you just you don't want to bring up the uh negative uh vibe when you speak up
so this the intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts lah so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
ah ya
mm ya
mm
ah ya ya ya ya ya
mm
ya and and in okay ah in university especially
okay
cannot
huh
mm
mm
ya
mm
drop
mm
ya
orh
oh wow
wow
it's uh it's the same thing for my my school also cause err if I'm not wrong ah is err when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university lah if you never meet their requirement after like every semester or something
but uh if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time um if you are if you have a academic warning already
lesser than two point eight
suspension meaning
ya
ah ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that to increase by a bit
ya
ah
mm
ah
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam ah
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
oh eh
wah
orh okay I
uh
hmm
mm
mm
huh
oh
ya
but is it mean the same thing
prof oh professor
french
orh is it
mm
oh I
ah
mm
um is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in uh game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is uh user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience ah since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
ah kan so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this uh tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say um enjoyed the little happiness in life
because if you ah if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
ah
ya
ah
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness lah
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it uh
they imagine them like eh with this
I I'll look good ah like ah with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
mm
ya
exactly
but I guess um
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
um elon musk eh he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can ah achieve
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
ah if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was err I okay lah when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy lah of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
ah their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
oh ah sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely all the
uh we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to lah
ah ah ya roller coaster
mm ya you have to take a break ah
that's why I feel
uh
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
which is why I also like how um okay lah not demon slayer something much more large scale which is Marvel
wow
Marvel is uh huge scale of
all the things that you ah
you imagine it to happen
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero ah but with no actual superpower
orh ya
cool
orh
ah
mm
ya
the black widow and iron man started
mm
oh ya
gauntlet
ya
um assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
you'll feel good lah
make your drive even
uh
higher
so that one err I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
uh good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements ah but in that case also like if you were to think about it ah
now eh ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some knowledge so I thought okay lah maybe
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make ah it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
uh it's it's hard ah is the most hardest thing for me
orh
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of there are more people that are saying like ah if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be ah okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
ah ah too introvert that they they don't want to show their weaknesses lah there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
mm can say lah
ya ya
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay lah before
uni ah you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like uh you learn programming all this and that it's useful because ah we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
uh how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
uh good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
ah exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
uh biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
for educational purpose
oh but okay lah cone
in in a way like the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
it's a good it's a
ya ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
ah ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth sia
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years lah give or take
in
oh
ya
strap eh
orh oh ya
probably they
eh eh best sia
oh man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive ah to experience it
persevere humanity to maintain young
orh
ah ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
oh
a'ah akaza
a demon
orh
oh ya
I will still stay young what I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
ah
ah upper moon
ya
same
mm
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live ah eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said um
the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
err people who die I don't know ah this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die lah normally
ya
that's humans lah in a way ah that it's a beauty ah like when you die you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know lah but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
ah set the bar
ya
ah wrestling or any any person in interest lah like oh
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already lah even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any uh
impact yet
ya maradona
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few uh weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
ah
passing
ah ya ya
it's like it heightens your
ah I guess you can say that
I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he uh that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film eh or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
ah
exactly
which is why I like anime
stop lah am I at taiwan taiwan at times already ah okay lah hello ah actually ah K bye

mmhmm
mmhmm
my wish ah
my wish
actually
ya
be a good children
then
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
mm ya
uh ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
uh then we find it
err
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
uh actually we can sell anything lah but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
uh
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
um
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals lah to work there
ya so
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
um
mostly is malay food like mee soto mee rebus
nasi lemak
so
mm
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
ya
so uh
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them lah
ya
searching for the suitable space lah first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
err good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mm
because
I
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so it's best either you share everything lah
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
ah
ya
mm
ya
mm
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
meal
meal
oh
meal
mm my memorable meal
well
actually I cannot recall there were many
I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had
no because I think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this um same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
mmhmm
smoked duck
uh
was it good
mm but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
err
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya err but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that
ya but
ya
mm

err travel you know you can start travelling
yes this one is my this one I'm not it's just now the bear talk it's I mean I mean what I say

drama or film
is
is purely an entertainment
I don't mind it's fiction or non fiction
kind of story because
these things are purely for entertainment so you just got entertained that's the purpose of
the visual

so how do you find your course uh is it you liking it
you mean your your A level friends
mm
your your friends friends who are doing the same course you mean
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
oh they have and all masters and all ah
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
mm
mm
mm
teaching
then
um but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
eh
mm
mm
mm
me
ya
ya so
uh we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know err take our time then
because now err when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
uh and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
like
it's all in the process
nothing eh
have
has my tedious life
mm
ya
so
what lah
mm
ya
free
oh there was err it's err healthcare
so like like terminally ill or critically ill uh and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very uh
you know um
so let's
so that's going to
um make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
um
ah
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
eh common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
if not that
maybe we can afford
how we are going to afford
ya
mm
mm
master
oh okay
err is with is with a private coach
yio chu kang
yio chu kang or choa chu kang
ya I think yio chu kang or choa chu kang
mm ya
it's err four lessons
mm
mm four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on lah
mm
err I mean uh two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very err
uh so I I I I think I need err more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill lah but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
is it with the equipment
pilates
ah
mm
is it good
just
err
just uh designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
um the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates lah I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive
mm
mm
I mean the credit
uh
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
um I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
mm
yes
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
mmhmm
ya
one dish
mm
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast lah
I don't mind
but err only the downside is that
err because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
um
I would rather go for something with proteins
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
ya
uh
ya
fried rice
oh mee hoon tom yum
okay
ah
okay
so how was the rice today uh the mandi rice
the smoke is just like only on the surface
ya
curry
hmm
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best um mandi rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
mm
okay
mm
pizza hut
hey which pizza you ate ah
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
err tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and ghee rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy lah
let's say you take err one cup of rice
any cups lah
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take um you can make it with the basmati rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you err if let's say one cup of rice uh you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of ghee
you put the ghee
then you slice like one medium size onion
um but the onion you should you should slice err very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
err translucent like a bit brown then you put
err what is the name in english uh
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all lah if you have
then you dah fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
err according to your taste lah
then you cook lah rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version lah there's many kind of
instead of uh instead of
so what's that one and a half cup right
uh
then you put the rice
ah
ya
ya curry chicken lah the best with potatoes
mm
can
no oh it's it's
it's easy to make
you then you can try to make tomorrow
I already to
it's not that difficult you just need one
ah onion that's all then the rest
ya you can use the rice cooker
the
pot lah the there is a pot call multi
err what is the name of the pot uh you can cook everything in that pot
err
yes
can you use that
no
multi function
so you can do everything in that one pot

okay again
oh okay
ha ha
uh huh

mm
alright so he's supposed to be moving out by october
huh
okay
wait wait so like
where did he go like when when did he move out
mmhmm
no okay
mm
mmhmm
but to me like what's done is done that was like a last month thing right
like the whole
ah but
he should have
you know
be upfront with everybody you about it right
wow
I mean of course
had anyone would would be pissed about that
so where's the guy now
ya ya
then his
then his things
right
but where that where can he go
I thought when he'll he'll stay with you cause he doesn't have he doesn't have a place
no but I don't
no but I don't have a place to go I I don't want to live in my mum's living room
alright I mean okay fair enough
but I thought he was
okay money
from his the other his
but
true
so what did he do with the money then
right
ha ha ha
no but that kind of behaviour right okay to be fair
he was my friend
a strangle
then you know you kind of knuckle jack hits a bit
wah man I cannot ah
but that's terrible ah
like
we are talking about like thousand two right or something
to be honest your rental rates is nonsense ah
you know
I would pay you five like like five six hundred for like
rental
ha ha
or there's
or there's an actual plague going on ha ha
okay so um about fahim thing
err
the other day
okay err
I'm going to say something about
brother herme
kan
right
ayip
pick me up after work
I you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
and all that
then on the way back err I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
oh down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things ah
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
ah then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired ah
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
ah us ya
so um then he was saying how um
how did they go into it I
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
err
kan
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think hilmi actually supports ah no of course not
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do lah
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up ah
then he was saying how um
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that ah
so now what now is just
huh huh
it's
it doesn't feel
great ah
I was telling him ah like they are gonna
ah when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him eh I but mine wasn't cause of cheating ah of course
so
like if I was the cheater
in that sense
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit tau
ya
like normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
eh
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea I was just saying okay
hey brother
you should remind me to bring an cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
it it
singapore is very small
oh wow
wow that's that's going into the wrong direction ah
so anyways right
ya so um about that I think then he was
telling me that
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
fair enough ah
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch ah
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
like how do you defend
ah his his actions from a moral standpoint ah
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am lah kan
uh being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given ah
mm
I don't know that's a very controversial statement ah
so by those dates
you you describe it as um
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
to me that one it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender lah like that's true
right
okay
fahim isn't exactly mister olympia material himself pe
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the err
how do I put this
okay
rounder side of life ah
at wah that's
brother why you got to use the F word
what it post
wah I cannot
sial ah
brunei
eh no no no no no
I've been to brunei
okay so
ah people in brunei
no I'm not talking about like the
workers are like the they have a lot of like foreign workers
no but they are middle
income people there
right
half of them are
ya
so like uh I was asking bell lah that time it's like why ah
like
when we do say you know
a couple of
chonkers due here in
singapore
ha ha
but
do you see more that there
then she was saying oh then she was expecting okay um one thing is
ah it's
that's A
B
err a public transport is a fucking nightmare
everyone drives
but there's no tourism to speak of
free education free healthcare
right
I mean
but healthcare is not free what
ya
oh ya
so basically I was
I was talking about ah about ruqayyah and then we talking about ya okay so
your your whole day your
I think what you're trying to say in summary is that
a bit spoilt
like
and she doesn't have that drive in her to
do more
like
uh huh
wait so there are
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
no no no no no
ah
you know
eh
wow
why does it sound mm
mmhmm
like it just physical
oh man
wow
but
I don't
the thing is right
I don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
how else you gonna get and loot
you know
I don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a revenge thing ah
maybe
very complicated stuff
you know like I know we've known the guy for like forever
I never thought
mmhmm
now is what
fourteen years
no I never
don't want to say that but you said but you said it
ya I never thought you with tino until but then again all of us
ya but somehow in in in your mind you always thinking you know okay uh marriage is like the big leveller ah
it would down
calm down his raging lions that kind of thing
do you even iron clothes
oh I haven't seen an iron board in years ah dude
what for
ya
mm
so anyways
I don't remember that
ha ha
wow
like like no one just wakes up one day twenty kilo heavier pe
don't care what you eat but the oh how many times you eat lah in that sense
wait
what's
what's your weight now ah
wow
eh is it
I I don't
is it
is it normal for your height I I don't actually know
right so if you
it's like you're on the the yellow zone kind of thing ah is it
oh no there's a difference you know you you you you cannot use the ah ang moh ones
ya ya ya result
white guys different ah
in terms of what lean body mass
ya
I mean we just evolved from different monkeys lah I guess
ah I don't think there's a big difference between malay and chinese
you know
ah wait wait wait wait
eh wait wait
what were they talking about ah
that one
okay okay
okay how how how tall are you
one six seven let me
eh brother you are at low risk good job
ah ya your is twenty one point nine
orh without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the one doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference ah
according to this my is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but I used to but I think um I think a couple of months ago I was
I was I was a bit of a
in a chonky
I think my my highest
my my my my peak ah
peak
no
my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos jer
right
I
I think I know which one you're talking about like the picture
sugar a is an addiction
huh huh huh
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
mm
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it ah
ya
alright
in law no not yet so ah cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
ah german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course ah and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so um it's like things to do if the if uh for you know respiratory things ah
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing uh this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time ah he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit siao also
ah quarterly report or something lah
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message ah
saying that you know
um good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email ah
then then at then a while ago were like complaining ah how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
ah then
he will he told me he told me that first ah that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay ah this old man might might have been repeating his story again
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two ah
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like oh why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else lah right
then said no
he got COVID
what the fuck
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
um the initial thing was
they wanted to get married ah this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents lah of course
it's usually like a like a mother thing lah like
ya this kind of
ya so um and then what you call it ah then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that uh he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
islam ah
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it woo you can go on for like this ah but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it lah then I'm like
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also lah I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
eh you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy what
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
so
ya so anyway then um
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
wuhan flu and all that
ah chinese cough as they say
and then err
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and um
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow ah from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved ah which is fair
ya lah of course lah you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay ah mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up ah
then uh
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
ah and they were kind of
having some progress ah but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause uh kan they both work from home
like
uh my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
um
ya then ah he goes over to his place a lot cause uh K so my my parents live in bedok south right which is
basically near tanah merah right
then he lives at the condo at tanah merah
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once pe
ya
so she goes over there like every other day ah to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
ah okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya sia ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it lah
one of those guys
ya
and then ah she's there like every other day then um that day I kind of went to meet my mum
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of eh why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about uh that issue like my sister
um being over there lah what
and saying how oh
my mum
then
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do ah
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
so the best thing to do
ya lah exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time ah he talked to me and uh he brought me out for beers
ah I've got things to do ah
ya so I didn't
what
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course lah so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones lah it's just to like you know
ah ya
so anyway um what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
ah at first if his parents have some reservations ah about him
going out with a malay asian girl ah
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no ah ah whoa this just whoa whoa that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like ah muslim countries lah right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way tau
was it mm
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first lah

something like that lah ah if not at work I'll be at home lah you know the the deal right ah
uh
ah
ya I I got said already ya
ah it is
compared the zoo they pay more but they and their shift is also slightly shorter lah
err you have a lot of fun lah especially with like your co-workers
but the the thing about challenger is different people works for different shift so
you you meet new people lah every time you work
so the
at the zoo lah
mm
ya you know you know started from the bottom lah then now ya how are you I
wah that's very nice
wow eh not bad that's not bad that's not bad

ya we can we
oh are are you looking forward to this uh
communication
ya lah ya lah
ya
ya
ya ya I I didn't feel like uh taking the history was
so it is good enough for me lah I feel that ah I will prioritize prioritize having money now
ya I guess so I mean
mm
ah
I mean I don't really make a lot of friends in school I mean because of the university ah environment lah like you know people come from different backgrounds and we have different timetables so
we don't really get to see each other that often but I do have one or two few friends lah that I I'm actually looking forward to meeting
and err catching up lah
ya
ah no lah it's my main one lah my main major which is um biological science lah
um
um that
mm mm I I I wanna adventure more into the maritime sector lah and I by maritime you mean the the sea lah
in the future ya
ya
ya
oh
true lah
true
correct correct lah true
ya ya I
we together lah all of us are in a malay club so
ya
so during that
ya commitment issues lah
ya
ah
wah
ya
ya lah ya lah
oh
so ah her malay oral is coming up also so I've been helping her
err with malay oral lah
then err
aside from that
ya I mean the the least I can do is just like be there lah support her and then give her advice
then
ya she she has she seems she seems prepared ah
ya towards the later half of the year lah
same with close to loofy's birthday is it
ah
ya
ya ya nadia tried to err take up err what
the right the arts design and media in
err from the looks of it ah I don't think she got in lah
ya
ah ya the
the something about the diploma I think diploma in teaching
ya kind of sad lah cause she actually turned down her scholarship to try to go for the
ya
ya
ya
mm she's not really interested into like the business kind lah I mean she can do like she encouraged the numbers she can like I think got good numbers lah graphs by by chart tax reform
all those jazz lah ya
ya
I try to
close to that lah similar similar stuff
ya
she will have fallback
ya
ya lah ya ya school starts when ah for you
oh
ya ya my the online semester starts first week of september we having like a welcome ceremony lah on the first of september itself so
it's all virtual lah a bit a bit boring but I mean
ya amsterdam
you know to watch soccer
then you watch people play cricket
true
ya lah not not my not my luck lah
ya
ya
it's getting worse lah in europe area
ya
ya err looking forward to it lah in the future
ah won't be anytime soon lah ya maybe after I get a full time job
after after graduating lah from the university
I almost there lah I feel that already ya
ya
orh
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's err respectable lah for the craft of
ya
mm
ya understandable lah
oh ya ya she she's I think five months
so
time right
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited ah
ya
oh true true
near sharmin's birthday I think
nah who who who I mean
mm government lah they will know that is more than the allowed number ah so
ya it's going to be a small one lah only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
um
ah ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool lah cause they really understands uh their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce ah in the future we work
ah ah ya he's doing fine lah um
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time lah because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during err everyday day to day operations ya
mm
ya ya ya my my dad ah cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed lah beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
cause he's been doing delivery at the site ah to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
mm
ya school fee is quite expensive
mm I think really does a good job lah in ensuring that uh local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years err no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level seh ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five ah
mm
my sorry what
oh my girlfriend ah oh she's she's fine lah because ah she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it lah how ah it's very interesting
so they will err how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
ya ya in that type of uh
effect ya format ya
ah facebook facebook live
then uh she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her uh school of uh
mathematics
err they had a zoom
what they found out from her name ah
ya
I mean ah aren't we all sore losers some days ah
oh uh it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
ah she went out lah with her family cause err
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
I can request lah I mean the idea of contactless kan but
uh I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible lah because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up
so uh
what to do
ya recently err one of your I think last year is it one of your friends graduated also right
there are what what do you got got for her
ya ya that close friend you met on err ya juliana
oh
mm
ya that's right that's right never forget about that lah because that's all you got lah
ya it's nice lah of your parents also
when you were when you were trying to err apply ya for the class

he is uh
he's work during our time before A levels ah
and then we ah
ya
ya usually one month also can apply but you want to apply now also can
mm
ya
it's where it's where is the best ah ya
they will still practice social distancing lah ya
ah
I honestly I haven't really went there because the next week is my first time so
I am looking forward lah to see how they will actually do this ah with the social distancing ya
ya
ya I mean since the the uh now they are trying to promote fist bump right so
ya
ya
K lah so enough of this um friday prayers lah ya so err

stalisha
my day today is very tiring obviously um it's been two days ah I sleep very late
um and so far it's been well um it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring lah
um it's among the home-based sellers lah
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
have their
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
ah ah
customers ah
yes
delivery is
um by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya ah so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight lah hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
um
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
ah I have school I have um freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
ya
go ah because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change lah because I like to bake also
um brownies or cookies something like that
branding
tahbegs tahbegs
ya it's tahbegs is from tahu and begedil but we make it very hipster
so it's tahbegs
ya T H B E G S
oh ya um I also own a small business selling bawals
eh it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be eh next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
um better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
ah because um me and my partner lah
ya we we
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
twenty one
that young
oh
ah
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
that's the best you can sleep
oh okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
oh mm ah
mm mm
wow okay
uh uh
mm mm
I you like wrapped
oh okay okay okay
uh uh
uh uh
oh my god
they didn't pay you
oh ya ya ya
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh I see
um
what am I doing at nineteen
um I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
um
there was this
and then um I was very camera shy last time
so I'm like meh like I I don't even bother lah but then my partner saw like eh you should try lah you just try then orh
I said no I don't want err I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the um the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
ah he applied to two ah company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
ah it was an unpaid job
for
um until I was maybe
um nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
um
by their apparel
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like um the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
err when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
tell me lah like oh you need to start
um charging these people because you are having a lot of um
and alhamdulillah it also went well
ah
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
um sell their products ah
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
uh and it didn't work ah
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because ah her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales lah so I was like okay um actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they um they really spread the word and tag you know
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
other companies ya
mmhmm
usually um before we post something right for the company we also like send the
what do they call it
okay lah the context ah the context of the post ah we
ya the description we always like um send it
ah on our post
uh it's our post because we are like um ya
usually is like that
ah no that that's the thing that's why I don't um I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like um they told me lah like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
um is very difficult
um and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle lah but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school um there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson um end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night lah something like that
ya it's like it's very bad lah is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up uh my own company ah
um
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
alamak we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
mm
because all of this um of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
um creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well lah and
uh uh
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
their customers like
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face lah when I'm opening this um Kamash
um
yes
and
out first what ah ah
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
eight colours already sold out
ya
ah we manufacture ourself
ah no uh we liaise with a factory in jakarta
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
mm
no lah I mean like obviously uh when you grow up
eh
ah my god okay it needs to switch
naturally um
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
cons about being a nurse
and then ah
some personal reasons lah for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
those type of
incident
car crash eh plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee what
and
ya lah exactly then I was like okay sure
so ah basically ah
so I'm like okay lah since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
um ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor orh an acting
orh okay ah clown doctor
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
oh okay
uh
I can fix my own teeth
mm
mm
wow
ya
oh my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
mmhmm
mm
mm I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
eh the first ya your first show is it
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like wah
well quite nice lor
so
ya
but it was good though
mm
oh I see
oh
mmhmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mm
ya that's that's the thing
um usually people are afraid to set a price
um
we calculate our expenses ah and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see lah um like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like oh we can sell it from this price to this price no uh no lower than that
if it's lower than that um means
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
mm mm
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not chai I don't like chai
oh really
oh I see
ah ah
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
oh my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
oh okay you thinking far
yes
uh huh
oh okay okay okay
I don't know ah I feel like
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
oh ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge um washing machine
wow such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in what and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
and then like I was training at
and then
ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's um
so ya
um how to say ah
they hold their respect lah towards their opponent
like are ready to like ah I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman
ya
um
but
ya
so you literally need to fly
you need to like jump and like
oh okay okay okay I can see
mm
counselling

for who for kids
oh
ya
no violent cause
no
huh
uh huh
cannot two weeks ah
ya
mm
hmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
but to them I say oh okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know eh

mm
um
ya I mean
it's quite impressive ah that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years ah
oh at any pressure lah
mm
but ya lah I I think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him lah cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
I'm quite happy sia for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya mm I would say they are doing fine now
but I'm just just stress ah bro for the last last two games ah
ya correct correct
confirm qualify ah europa europa
ya champions league dah
ah ya lah so that's that lah
quite sad lah cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton ah
ya
mmhmm
ya that is expected of them lah
ya so
but uh you know you know football just football lah
it just a game so
mm
ya
correct correct this ah can't be predicted lah
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
yes
mm
true true true
ya
oh ya speaking of liverpool right so how is uh your good our good friend ah havi
ya
oh
oh the usual springleaf or the prata place ah
mm
ya that's true that's true
wah so you'll be meeting him later ah
oh wow
ya
that's good that's good
ya just send him my ah regards ah
err like him to know that
I'm always happy for him lah
cause this is like first time in
ah ya ya ya correct correct
yes yes
uh that's amazing
ya now he already ya sia he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time ah
ah
how emotion emotional football gets ah
mm
ya true true
but oh wells
oh so what to to go into full time studies is it
does he does he say the requirement for like what do you call it ah the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme oh the
something to do with like mature mature student or something eh
oh james cook mm
ah okay okay
he but his passion nice lah
under him mah
mm
mm
trainings
mm
ya correct correct
and uh
ya
ya I was at err I was at the and ang mo kio over there ya
ya correct correct
you know drive around the neighbourhood
mm do roundings only ah
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years ah
cause no one from my from my my squad ah actually went to the same ya as me
cause they cause they base you based on your
sorry sorry can you repeat that again ah
err didn't get to hear clearly
mm
ya I would say that central area quite tame mah
ya
whether it's like err important or not ah it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was ah
ya but all in all
okay lah life
valuable lah ya
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
cause
mm
ya correct correct
mm
true true
ya
ya
but oh well that's
it was a good times ah back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish err
I wish I have plans after this ah but sadly I don't
err you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this err my vicinity lah
correct ah
ah
I usually go for a minimum ten ah
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
ya
mm
oh okay okay
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
now I barely need a sip of water ah
ya
ya correct
mm
ya
the
cause if you drink too much then later your system
it's it's it's hampered with already ah so you need to stay stay clean ah
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
mm
ya correct correct
heatstroke ah heatstroke
mm
correct correct
you more vulnerable to heatstroke lah
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
kan
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
mm
ya
well
uh I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages ah but I've been uh
err a good a very good consumer of like err juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice ah yes you as you as you saying
uh I would say at least
two bottles lah
two bottles err five hundred kind ah
of juices ya correct
mm
mm
ah
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
ah okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits ah
mm
wah
wah that's
I think that's err that's the right way to go ah to be honest
ah
oh serious
then
then is the texture smooth
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable lah but
you need to use a
good blender lah
ya I would say that lah
ya
ah
mm true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
um
but as for
err grapefruit
uh those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit ah
ya
so be smooth ah
sorry grape
ya different different
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut ah
mm

um very thick
eh how
what
what thing
danish coming over for what
for what sia
you got like a lot of time ah
now danish now busy man already gonna get engaged soon right
quite fast sia
still remember last time he
just
in school
one very funny fellow ah
ya
then look at him now ah
family man
hais time pass by so fast sia
today
so
in the morning I just stay at home
just listen to lecture
then
after that I stay home ah the rest of the day
lazy ah but nothing to do ah
I want find job eh
part time ah now still schooling what
but then
I don't know ah
eh I wish ah can go back there
thirty
like
it's legit seh it's like you never do guard duty before right
a
like when I do there is like leh really I work for two hours then I rest for four hours
then
they want people that can commit more days
means
ya
but actually last sem
cause last sem last semester is everything was
so I can while I was working cause it's four hours rest what
al-ameen
I not sure seh I think around
I think until two three like that ah
if I not wrong ah
ya
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy ah
if if I'm not exercising already all the more I shouldn't eat there what correct or not
ya diet ah if cannot cannot exercise then diet ah
but I think I want to start back soon ah exercising
extreme ah
he he he
mmhmm
but then I don't know leh like I feel like
uh since I got the height already right
ya but
the effort ah and like
I don't know eh I feel like going gym
okay
like
I don't know ah like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
so but that stigma also like
a bit
a bit paiseh ah
but I feel like if I don't start like
eh you know I I looked through my gallery right
like
last time during
I skinny sia
okay
not not not skinny ah I'm I was skinnier
like I was still big but like
I think hundred and four ah uh last time I checked was hundred and two
weighing scale
so now
I just take as my weight still at hundred and two ah
I don't know eh my
cause since after right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five ah
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
so
not say maintain lah but uh after can order in already what so I always buy nasi lemak
ya
like before I know ah like towards the end of ah
cause army kan army the the longer
the superiors all will be ah
ya
so towards the end is like every week
I eat nasi lemak I eat Fatty Bom Bom
eh
Fatty Bom Bom free ah I want to eat ah
eh
watch your language man
woodlands have at marsiling
no no no no no no it's uh you know where marsiling is
it's it's opposite marsiling ah but not to the polyclinic side tau
you know you know marsiling got new shopping mall the where the police post is
towards the tracks
oh ya ya ya
but what's the difference seh
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that one is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name mah it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know ah
but
like if got feels for Fatty Bom Bom ah it's just like
no no no it's not at afghan there it's at
ya it's opposite dunman sec ah
then lia my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
like really like it's it's like
yio chu kang to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far ah
may half half the journey ah from yio chu kang to your house
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars ah
the
uh tampines one not so bad eh
I know
usually me and lia buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
usually I get the
cajun cajun eh cajun cajun chicken ah
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice ah the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken ah
Fatty Bom Bom or FatBoy's
ya
depends ah some
you know some of the hawker centre ah
the western shop got like secondary school feels ah
Idah's Kitchen
I don't remember sia
is it the one the the thai shop take over ah
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
oh oh oh
I that one I thought that one is korean food what
oh I don't think I ate there before ah
now they got new one ah at Koufu
that kind of price ah
uh the
the whole range ah like you know chicken chop uh
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff ah
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it ah
usually they give like half bowl like that right
Koufu you know where the uh
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
but I not too sure ah maybe
japanese shop kan
eh
how lah I want to get better at DOTA sia
no eh but I play
it's like
if I get toxic opponent eh like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good ah
maybe ah maybe also
but I don't know ah
I don't know eh like
like
the genshin impact also cannot right
but okay ah nevermind ah because genshin like you can't really play with friends ah like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode ah
then you just explore the world yourself ah
then
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore ah
like the call it resin
so
you know ah so like uh this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge ah like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by lor then it recharge slowly
so it's mostly a waiting game ah like you finish
I don't know sia I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
like like really the game play is
fantastic ah phenomenal
but
I would say ah M I've play ah so far
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
ya so it's more of a waiting game ah so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term ah
ya true ah
oh
they spent like
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
I think maple ah cause this one is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already ah
like I I complete all the story mode already
ya ya ya it's like DOTA like that ah
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already ah like
ya some more it's like
like
an advantage is advantage ah but like they make it minimal lor
since when I even watch soccer
I don't know ah like
I never I've never seen the the
what's the word eh the
the attractiveness of watching soccer ah like it's just
so slow
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
you wait pass pass pass I don't know ah maybe just not my thing ah I guess
eh
tomorrow tomorrow I got no school ah
wanted to book ah
mm
I really not sure sia
I think the same week ah on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks ah
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
eh I do tomorrow already
it
eh I think they blacklist me already
where you where you uh where you plan on getting
APOL
uh huh I only know I only know Secret Lab ah
but then the pricing eh similar ah
like
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself what like it's not genuine leather right
ah
uh five hundred dollars on a chair
uh huh
huh
worth it ah got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site what
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this one must ask ah I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it ah
every other week
oh really ah
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but
like you know Coke is very very corrosive right
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
like
F&N pe F&N is like the standard ah the mm
they got like a lot of Coke
like one one what do you call that eh uh basket
not basket ah they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
ya different
syrup also not a big fan ah
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established ah
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons uh uh the ice lemon tea is the blue colour one but they got the
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea ah but the blue colour one is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness ah ya the sugar
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
for for a while already ah
eh a'ah eh uh
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job ah dude
haven't ah but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know ah I just scared
like history repeat repeat itself ah
uh ya that's why
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much ah
so maybe not that bad ah
ya but like
in the one that pays well ah
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet ah
okay ah honestly ah
that time you work what no meh
ah
uh
oh
sheikh also work kitchen ah
oh
the one a
eh but that one also see your manager also ah
because
it's not really banquet ah but they set up for the banquet people ah
shang Shangri-La
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
I think so like who
oh yeah yeah yeah but
ah ya then this one is only for
like wedding reception only ah
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager ah so
the manager is like sheikh and that one also
uh like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay lah
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much ah
ya
ya
then I don't know ah I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends eh
uh
maybe
eh have you have you went to Fika before
ya eh the food there
ya it's it's
you know where working title is eh actually working title closed already it's beside working title ah
huh they work there
I cannot imagine rian at Fika though cause the people there are like really
how to say ah I don't know ah I can't imagine rian there
like aidil aidil I still can see him ah working at Fika but rian a bit hard ah to imagine him working there
eh but the food there the food
the eh the ambiance all
top notch ah
like work there also I think swee
eh the food
oh I I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause uh my friend tell me their service there is like top notch ah
but then my friend say ah like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get ah
worth it lah ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend ah
oh
ah ya
I want to try ah but like
where is it ah I never knew where it was eh
but it's at bugis also
but then mm
but then the price ah start dating
ugh you scared what must pay for her ah
this
sad face
uh I thought you say you got beef with akshay
eh got beef with both the boyfriend and the girlfriend ah
uh beef is on
eh ya lah I think I want to watch
ugh
cause
no cause it's not a proper show it's like
mm ugh uh
uh no no no okay
but their storyline is all connected I think that's what The Real Bros is ah
ya uh key and peele established already ah
they got this new video ah what what was it eh uh
eh which one was it eh key and peele
it's the newer one to come out
uh
uh uh oh the jaden smith one
then you should uh uh you should watch it ah the jaden smith one funny
that time I watch with shah
car park ah
ah ya ya cause you were late ah
eh how you want to plan now or not meet with sundair
no ah
last month ah
don't say like that what makes you
ya
rehan why rehan
ha funny guy rehan
eh then how later later want to play DOTA
I play for a while ah
uh
I want to get better don't know
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress ah
valorant is not sia actually it's quite realistic what is like same as almost go but
only the suit like a bit
eh how
are you are you buying the five or not
oh
uh
ya like the first console I owned was
ugh cause okay
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing ah
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
ya so
then after that eh you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my
eh eh no primary five exam primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy I want game boy
not really strike a deal lah like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three ah so like I never really believe them ah
uh wouldn't say well lah like
so so ah A A B B
like A B B B
like I would say it's okay ah above average ah slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know ah one day I just come home eh
then turns out one was for me ah one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted I wanted game boy what
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no ah but wasted ah cause my parents bought when it first came out
so it's one thousand
ah
ah ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my the slim one come out
ya
but then that the closest to console I got ah
ya but actually the games there quite good sia
ya
ah
I think take over ah the market
Vita Vita Vita ya ya ya
downfall lah ya
then I
but I
I think
ya it's like
ah that one is a Pokemon brand already ah
until now right ya Switch
got other games ah
ya don't know ah
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked ah don't know ah this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing ah
ya
the uh he got post on Twitter ah I got see a picture of his uh like office like that
I think
publicity ah like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that what
got a
probably that one also not he play ah maybe his team play for him ah
ya
hais
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice leh
like I okay this one is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular ah
adventurer concourse I forget ah
it is ah it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
uh medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself ah
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war is what ah
is it
oh no no no
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from lah
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget ah uh
I wah I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side ah
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
err uh quite cool ah
I forgot what's the name of the game ah
plazma burst
mm
isn't that just uh
escape room
and then there's a ghost chasing you
oh is it
I'm not sure ah
farid all ah
skipper
aiman
aiman
oh I don't know ah I never see ah they post on twitter ah
okay lah not bad lah he was top top in singapore ah one point of time
then your
for that hero will increase
ah so like uh he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again ah
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore ah
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands yishun ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's uh asian server ah
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in johor top in selangor top in sabah that kind of thing
ya that's why
singapore is one state ah singapore is a state what it's a state country right
uh
out outdate outdated information ah that one
okay I can say also lah
hais
mmhmm
how you know
of course lah
mm
the malay eh actually this one I can ask my friend lah you know khai
ah she very interested in like malay culture and all that lah so like
I do research on it also
on it but khai like he can tell me like
oh got this guy
he travel with uh columbus
around the world
so ah he say it's a malay it's a malay guy ah that travelled with columbus to find out that the world is round
ya
he research about all these ah
um
like um got
uh
how to say eh
in power ah
like they
uh
then they defend all themselves
quite cool ah when you
when you hear the story
haig road
steak
eh
burger got another YouTuber ah I forgot what's his name ah sam the burger guy ah something like that
that one also he makes swee ah like proper american burger
not so fat ah like around guga size also
but he a bit redneck vibes ah
ah I don't remember he wear specs ah
uh huh
so like if you
that one I not sure maybe now cause he quite big already kan maybe he can get sponsors ah but at the start I'm pretty sure I think he buy himself ah
like you know it's like he just very passionate about cooking
from japan all like you see there's
the knife all very nice and very sharp
I got see knife restoration lah
eh but keep samurai sword like cool ah in singapore
is it illegal eh
you got watch the uh eh I think crimewatch eh
it shows like this indian guy ah he turn over a new leaf
ah king something kind david king eh
george king eh I think his name george king

so fathul I have a question for you mm if you have three wishes what are err what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would err void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say um by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things hmm maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants lah
mm and some skills that I want to have err maybe include err having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world ah
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily err to us to some people to live happily is to have err the money and the wealth
err so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy ah and intelligence also ah this is to me I think it relates to me also ah because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
uh so maybe for now we move uh to the next question which is err superpowers fathul what err if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
ah eh
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of ah the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you err by accident
the the
the amount of err infection or the possibilities of uh infection rate ah you have anything to argue
yes correct
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk uh ambitions that I have
or maybe uh I I can take risks without having worrying that I might uh injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe err get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win ah
provided I am strong ah and maybe with this regeneration
hmm
I can donate let's say some parts of my uh limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
hmm where I have this ability so I can do is err I request my leg to be cut off and then give away err in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard uh tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
mm what do you think about this regeneration ability
mm it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having uh to be looked at or without err being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
hmm I have this
I want to be uh isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self ah to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems uh affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
mm
how long maybe until I feel peace ah so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months ah but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months ah then slowly maybe I will
err increase the number of the period ah slowly
hmm
we can never do something to improve the people around us
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable lah
but it has to be looked in a certain way ah whereby the person
err
he is not affecting badly uh around the people uh uh he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state ah
uh
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
they will change a lot lah so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small err goals small err
small achievement so this child will live without uh having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife ah he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife err agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free ah to do anything that he wants
do you think so
eh
uh cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
err
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary ah but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams ah
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart ah
mm so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self err I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self ah
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
mm and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
um what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos uh I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and uh an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud lah or maybe just email yourself ah so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
err a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself uh since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is err I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see err how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe err start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
mm
K
you maybe you next we should talk about um near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was err I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was uh stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall uh is when I was
err riding bike uh it happens maybe due to
err rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to uh overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next uh topic that I have in mind which is err a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
uh ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
hmm whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that err there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
um synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example uh few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
err I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future um a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go uh deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took uh I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
so you have anything to add on

oka
uh getting ready to cla

but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have um
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then um
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown ah and then ya
perspective you can be
right I mean
but we we are alright with that we've we've
we've done that with our music life we've we've we used to be isolations
ya
the effects are there lah you know
err I don't think
kan
more of err like going through a war
not not like before this you know
constantly err doing things
be it err
err
you know all being um
stopped I would say that
ya
or or or the environment
of going through eh err things um
ah the things that we do
is err not doing very well right
they had an industry and the thing is
and kind of stopped or or or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
ugh
ya ya ya all the big err bars club
um
chill a little bit and them um
see what's going on and then from there
err
come to a point whether
and what not
time um everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
uh for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not um
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if if you look like really really close
um
it was haywire napster coming in you know
ah it was for for for consumer they will like it ah
but people who produce it people who
who you know
mm you know big err movie affected by
whack or or or
or just like um be part of
this you know like just come in and slide in
ya I mean
there will be light there will be light
um
apart from that probably um
share it because ya

ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
ah ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
okay ah I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use ah
like you can't really copyright that shit
eh fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
err ya I think that's different
mm fair
oo ya okay I get it I get it
is it not bad sia
I mean I mean at that price range quite affordable already sia considering like
okay lah okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
ah uh huh
err it's like five in india
somebody copy eh copyrighted ah ya copyrighted ah
somebody copyrighted five so
five they Sony can't release five as five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
I mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony Sony will try to
probably ah I think
probably will try to buy it off the person ah
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
one two three four
ah ya and it's Sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
oh four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya lah you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create ah create ah you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay ah it was rocky ah
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better ah
I mean it's just a brand name only ah at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like oo look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive ah but then it's like
eh ah no I'm not about that life man
man
no ah not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya lah I mean it is a gaming peripheral ah but still like
at least limit it ah like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like oh Razer
and then it you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that one by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
eh that kind
ah
with my current night shift
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this one is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like oh my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay lah like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the one that you are looking at this the second one
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit lah like
whoever ah whoever say something right then err or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job ah and then like cannot ah
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring siol
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya lah no lah leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
uh I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can ah but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay ah depends on the company lah but this is this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense ah but
the travel expense though it's free
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right ah I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance ah you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything ah
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can ah
let anyone use the thing
sial ah I have I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me ah
no lah it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like eh there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like err if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
uh all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras ah
like I'm just saying there's
there's uh
hidden thing to it lah like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply ah
no ah
like where the hell am I supposed to go sia if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can ah can is can ah like the
I mean the
no ah
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the no you eat there in the oops room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
uh I mean it's true ah I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that one then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before lah but
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this ah job
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like sial ah where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
uh ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is ah but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days a few days ago also
ah zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya lah
eh no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
is
fourteen days siol I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
okay ah not really okay ah
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that lah like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what uh
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
uh I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay ah
eh but then new zealand that time got uh recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive ah
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see lah what happened now
three hundred thousand already
uh huh
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see eh go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like sial ah
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit sia like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
oo
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest what so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya lah I mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only ah I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything ah
ya
okay
really
uh huh
oh is it
ya borat is borat lah so
I wonder if they edited that out
uh huh
I mean to be okay ah no ah
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is ah but you know it's fucking video proof ah like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
uh they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know lah which state ah one of the judge lah they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is ah
ah
no comments no comments
in
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for taiwan soon
I think world war three should start soon
err china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to taiwan right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit taiwan ah
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
eh ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
taiwan is part of china and then
I mean ya lah like
and they could have just let taiwan
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of taiwan like no
I think they call them uh D D C P right eh no D C C
oh wow
I mean taiwan is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay I mean
okay let's be let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay lah
that one no comments ah ya
it has it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
uh huh
uh huh
legit ah
oh wow
uh huh
ee ah ya
that's malaysia
that's the issue I mean
ya
you all busy fighting each other also lah
kan
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
oh speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay ah it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
kan I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
ah
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that lah but okay ah there are the backwater parts ah
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
sial ah
uh huh
it's basic human nature lah what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you eh
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya lah
okay
uh huh
okay
wow
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions ah
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is it is what it is ah it's his style
either way it eh no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe eh
we might as well be
kim jong un
oh my god I don't know ah sia
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
and that that is trump in a nutshell lah eh
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lagging
oh wow
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care ah
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the period
that one terrible siol like
only essential workers what
me ah
then like yours truly ah
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
they got
it's not even that much sia
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like sial ah they can sial ah that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during period sial ah how to earn fifty sia
okay ah not not everyone can ah but that's why that's why during I had the same driver a week straight sia
he live somewhere ah there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book eh same guy tomorrow eh same guy
and like okay ah ten minutes only what not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
like unless on that day I overslept or something
rare ah but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no ah
it was at boon lay
don't know call call message
everything no reply
siol then I like what the fuck sial wait here half an hour already siol then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing sia cancel
no ah
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already sia
kan
just cancel get a new one
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
uh
okay lah ya there's there's the more apt way to say it lah
you collect the food already
then you put delivered
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
oh ya ya ya ya
ya
or those people in I mean the disabled people
hmm
ah
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift what
like rare you find
that that one is dorms
eh well
service industry lah eh
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit ah you get that kind of shit ah
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it ah
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night ah
cause
mm
ah
okay lah I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
there's only one entrance and one exit lah so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell ah got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell
then the person will come
ha right
then provided you got exact change
I'm helping do your job
but ya I mean that that period ah
the the one that people were all in panic
that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you eh not the six hundred no
one point five litre
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
ah
like okay ah if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand ah but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like eh siala
this thing ah like that like that like that
then like
free masks don't know how many times already they updrage the mask some more

uh huh
ah yes correct correct
mmhmm
ya
how how does how does it work
in the new uh version
okay
mm mm
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice ah there's no uh you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can err
do according to your preferences ah
ah okay so there's no like
four four two
mm
mm
so in order for me to play
for example tiki-taka I cannot have a
uh anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my uh my formation is flick enough for the tiki-taka or
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference ah like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what lah
so for the
players also
mm
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and uh
mm
mmhmm
okay
ah okay okay okay so
they have their own uh attitude lah and uh they have their own attitude when facing the
ah each games ah
mm
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right denmark is it
ah
if I'm not wrong eh uh the last
that's that's long sia
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year sia last year or last two years
so I eh correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be ah fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing twenty you think twenty one coming soon or not
oh the the twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
ah ya
oh I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out ah so if okay if I am going to download it
ah
okay
Acer uh you got you got remember what it's a A what
A two nine five okay that one I think I quite lost already
ah K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
okay lah so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
ah okay
okay
F sixteen and twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
ah
ya I know I know I know
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
I have ah eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth ah
I don't want jagged jagged uh you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
ah
ah
ya hopefully
but wasted the twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also uh got twenty touch
ah
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
a'ah
that's a
that's stressful
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people ah cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror ah kan but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
ah
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say ronaldo cristiano ronaldo
okay from juventus to
maybe
man U
okay from man U
is he
a junior
in man U but he's an alumni
ah okay
ah
okay
mm
ah okay okay okay
okay
so okay ah dortmund sancho is the english guy is it okay okay
mm
let's say let's say
this sancho is is english and let's say his his his old maybe thirty plus
okay let's say he's thirty plus
I bring him to maybe southampton or a or a full of junior club
so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
ah
mmhmm
mm
okay
okay
this social group is
very important lah actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
mm
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games ah
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
ah
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
port for it
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than sixteen
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know lah I I
ah
I I mean I I know about the the the
mm
ah
ah ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
mm
it is intensive ah okay but anyway
okay ah maybe after this then I will give it a try ah
okay lah we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
look left look right
look look see see lah that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
mm
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
mm
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the ah twenty is very realistic every every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
ah so
so imagine actually imagine
twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
eh eh how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have sia god damn it four more days okay ah nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine lah maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be

how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
a'ah
okay
okay
mm
so okay ah
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see ah
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see eh when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
mm
I mean you can ask juventus how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that one is their what italian one is it
oh okay
okay
mm
mmhmm
oh that's so
wah
ya correct
mmhmm
ah yes yes
mm mm
ah okay I mean
well that's
err when they are from the group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
cause there were
mm mm
there is know the
even below north south
time for them to just you know what
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole ah
ah
ah
ah that's why
ya
ya but
day
I mean technically if everyday
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
err physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger ah
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger ah I'm the privileged one as compared to
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause
body change
unfortunately and my body change reflexes change
your mind can't keep up with what your body more and at the same time
when you fly when you jump and fly high
increase weight means increase pain
so I'm not gonna risk it
that was after secondary school after first year poly
second year poly I start I stop already
ya
so poly
poly year two
year three
year one year two
CISCO CISCO oh that's almost seven years
ah
six seven six seven years I never play
oh anyway if you want to know ah five aside
ah
ah
ah
ah
I mean that's a good idea ah
I mean true
you want to be
ah
mm
I mean technique ya I mean true you have to let it go
but I'm quite surprised why
he managed to win the ball in that manner in the first place
yes
watch football would be know recently lah uh after army
I don't catch up already cause know
people watch football at three I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say eh
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true ah
to ah
well I mean
like what
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
mm
if you notice
eh he cannot speak tamil pe
then he shouldn't
mm
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
mmhmm
uh huh
nobody dubbed over him kan
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say vanakam for thirty times ah for for thirty minutes pe I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
english
of course ah
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see ah my my
grandfather my
basically all the old people ah
all the our not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me lah so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
ah the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
mmhmm
okay
a'ah
mm
a'ah
mm
mm
ah
mm mm
okay
okay
ya correct
mm
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this uh
not say rider ah this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
and then and he and she asked me in english about I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from johor to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who um who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
mandarin or tamil lah if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent ah and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right wah this is very confusing ah
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true pe
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish ah no sia
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
but
I suspect
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
mm
so how
a'ah
mm
okay
you you agree pe okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say lah how
ah
ya that's why
ah
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
remind each other about know how your going and calling each other brother in italian pe
okay but you you understand what I trying to say pe
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
mm
ya
I mean ah there there is a I think there's a occasion pe there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
yet he's always interrupting us oh by the way ah
mm
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
err right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
mm
ah
okay okay
ah coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
that one for what eh
okay
okay
okay
mm
ah ah ah
ah that is quite long tau
ya actually a lot of things changed ah
but it's nice
ah ya lah
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot lah I mean it's so so constricted lah this place to be honest
uh twenty twenty four seven
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a ah there is a schedule
ah
ah now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean
now is already twenty september pe you you there's what is it called your your
work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already tau
how unproductive are you going to get
how more
more unproductive are you going to get
you don't feel embarrassed
technically
I know
mmhmm
there is a
ya
yes
I mean I tried to warn you
I mean ya I know I understand how you feel to to to to be squeezed
just for maintenance ah
mm
ya I know I know
I mean
wow that sucks
mm
ya ya
I mean just like that eh
err
a a billion dollar company multi billion dollar company just
gone sia
but
I mean oil should be cheaper right or
it already
keep it up
picking up already
ah
mm
I mean ya lah ya lah there
will go back
to
quote unquote our prime minister status
for unpaid
I mean
I mean I'm not saying anything lah but in order for you to you know
move forward in this pandemic is to ensure the china tension doesn't rise any higher cause
as long as and china is continue to be fighting I don't think there will be a vaccine anytime soon
ah
ah ya
okay
ah
now that's a very interesting concept
ah
ah ah
mm mm
okay
I
I don't want to die
the what's that called I mean I don't know what the are trying to think ah but
but uh I mean if we see uh
technically if the government is not very
is saying is saying that the mask does not work
I think we can raise it up to our ah and
ah
so maybe we can raise up to our and ask our government to release us from this
mask thing I mean
we got safe entry pe
the the thing is does it work though

devolution done uh last one is done lah
okay if let's say right for me ah if I plan eh sometimes it doesn't work
that way so it's very disappointing ah better don't plan just go you say like you will say uh if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle lah
