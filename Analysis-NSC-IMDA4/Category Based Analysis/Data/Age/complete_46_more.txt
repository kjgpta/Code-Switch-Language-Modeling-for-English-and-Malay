or less than two hours <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah] edit
(uh) <malay>tadi</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan</malay> my
my russian teacher <malay>tu</malay> the skype over skype [eh]
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was (err) he was a having a conversation with his friends our (uh) what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me <malay>yang</malay>
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
I and the song was from #tokyo# square then she's like #tokyo# square so he thought that <malay>dia dari jepun ke</malay> group <malay>ni</malay> then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean [lah] it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was (uh)
(err) who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like [eh] that's not the famous song from #tokyo# square
but the song actually nice <malay>tapi dia pakai lagu</malay> #sukiyaki# <malay>punya lagu</malay> [tau] do you know #sukiyaki# right there's this
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the #tokyo# square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it [ah]
(uh) it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow <malay>kak tina</malay> to this concert by #tokyo# square
so #tokyo# square actually that
it's not a a got a #tokyo# square concert but they perform a few songs [ah]
(uh) because there are many other things that (err) at that show so #tokyo# square was one of them so I I I remember #tokyo# square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word #tokyo# slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
(uh) that is the originally is from #tokyo# square but there's some (uh) famous <malay>mat salleh</malay> singers sing that song [lah] western singers that (err) sing (err) #tokyo# square <malay>punya lagu</malay> but that is I say <malay>macam</malay> singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
to america right they don't have
a lot of talent [lah] they don't <malay>macam</malay> you know
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is #sukiyaki# [ah] from what I know
(uh) but <malay>dia punya</malay> melody has been reused and reused by other bands [lah] but that is not the most famous #tokyo# square
(uh) because like I mean <malay>nama</malay> #tokyo# square <malay>tapi dari</malay> singapore you know <malay>macam</malay>
that's the that's the unique thing [lah] that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin> I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin> I need you
because my I think <malay>kak tina</malay> did some events [ah] for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
put us somewhere then she brought me with her [lah] so I think one of that that's why she know #tokyo# square
(uh)
and that they were performing <malay>dekat mana</malay> [tau] <malay>kat depan</malay> if I am not wrong [eh] at this <malay>padang</malay> area near parkway parade
they had this show they had this
no <malay>macam</malay> this area <malay>dekat depan</malay> parkway <malay>ke sebelah kat</malay> parkway <malay>ke</malay> one of those area [lah] because parkway was you it was like a famous [lah] you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center <malay>dekat</malay> eighties nineties <malay>mana ada banyak</malay>
[ah] so you remember [lah]
(mm)
(uh) the open space then they put up (err) the stage right [eh] (um) but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like [what]
(uh)
sam willows
I think <malay>kalau mungkin mungkin yang</malay> singapore <malay>yang</malay> rock band [lah] <malay>yang dulu-dulu</malay> [ah]
[ah] the malay rock band #ramli sarip# all that there is known <malay>tapi</malay> for the english
medium [eh] english medium <malay>tak banyak</malay> that's why #tokyo# squares is one of <malay>tapi yang</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> sam willows <malay>sekarang</malay> famous there were a few [ah]
(uh)
is there a song baby jane [eh]
(uh)
four

ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese (err) medium right like the malay medium
(err) have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
(uh) on the side line [lah] it's like the a full time job for them

he was able to
like they say <malay>kembangkan dia punya</malay> talent [ah]
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous [what]
ya
[ah] ya the malay medium [lah] but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like #kit chan#
you know <malay>macam yang ada</malay> english the (err) english medium <malay>ada</malay> but they are not
they are not world famous [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the their world famous because they perform

astro [eh]
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this (err)
[ah] not really talent train [lah] it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market <malay>macam kira</malay> malaysia <malay>ada</malay> market you know
<malay>macam nak cakap pasal</malay> comedian <malay>ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar</malay> comedian <malay>pun</malay> comedian <malay>macam</malay> (err) #suhaimi# [eh] #suhaimi# part time you know at least <malay>dia dia</malay> part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
<malay>jadi macam</malay>

singapore the the [ah] they're not very good with improvisation <malay>tak bagus</malay>
[ah] I I I understand <malay>macam boboi boboi punya</malay> jokes [eh] #boboi# the group the maharaja lawak</malay> [eh] [kan] they have #boboi# they have the different
[ah] what is that either let like either when they talk about <malay>loghat</malay> [eh] there's always a <malay>tema tema</malay> like like <malay>loghat</malay> like is always going to be malaysia <malay>menang</malay> because singapore <malay>tak pandai buat loghat</malay> you know
it's only people like [ah] #zizan# #zizan# [eh]
they can really do <malay>loghat</malay> know and they really are very good at imitating <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya macam</malay> they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know <malay>macam</malay> malaysia really <malay>bercakap loghat loghat</malay> is accent right <malay>kira loghat orang</malay> #kedah# <malay>orang</malay> #kelantan# and then
they are more exposure ya
<malay>kita punya loghat</malay> is <malay>loghat bahasa baku</malay>
no no but they are very professional I remember I <malay>pergi</malay> (err) the not <malay>kedung kodek</malay> what's that
the theater [lah] that the malaysia that we went to to watch the #nadrah# right
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching <malay>pi mai pi mai tang tu</malay> at that time was #imuda# #imuda# that there were some people <malay>sayang</malay> they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform !ee! <malay>apa tu</malay> they can really perform <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat masa yang berpanjangan</malay> [tau] <malay>macam ada</malay> stamina is really that <malay>atau buat orang macam orang pergi</malay> #kelantan# #kelantan# they they the people doing <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they can really do <malay>dikir barat</malay> the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs [lah]
I remember when M #nasir# was talking to a
(err) #hady# [eh] #hady mirza#
for the
(err) what's the talent show [eh]
the <malay>yang yang lama-lama</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia kata orang</malay> glamour <malay>ada</malay> what is that [ah]
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia <malay>dia</malay> perform astro <malay>punya</malay> [lah]
I think astro <malay>punya</malay> organise so ya guest judge was
(err) M #nasir# so (err) #hady mirza# because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube [lah] I I I I watched through
[ah] <malay>tapi dia ada</malay> all the the veteran singer so #hady# was face off with this other
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose [lah]
[ah] so they have this person in the end <malay>dia menang dua-dua</malay> two of them <malay>memang</malay> [kan]
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think (err) (err) M #nasir# asked him (err) #hady# where have you been
why now you know <malay>macam</malay> like in a way <malay>kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat</malay> malaysia you know
because he was (err) wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work (err)
ya <malay>pasal dia dah</malay> then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really <malay>menyanyi</malay> is really his talent you know
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem [eh]
no but <malay>macam</malay> I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series [eh]
like zoe #tay# and that time zoe #tay# was the were the in she was really the talent like #pan ling ling#
junior [eh] #yuan ching# you <malay>tahu</malay> you <malay>kenal dia</malay> was she some
ya zoe #tay# was from your <malay>ni</malay>
#yuan ching# #yuan ching# <malay>yang dekat</malay> #jurong# [eh]
[oh]
her association
no but but you had that #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni is it #yuan ching#
#yuan ching# <malay>macam hancing</malay> the the #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni dinner right you [eh]
no I said if you want to go you can go with
<malay>siapa tu</malay>
(err) your friends <malay>apa ashik</malay> [eh] <malay>siapa</malay>
#amin# [kan] <malay>dia orang tak pergi</malay> [eh]
I told you the three of you form a table [what] with your other friends and <malay>sama kelas</malay>
no at that time [lah]
now <malay>memang susah</malay>
[ah]
pass away already [eh]
pass away [eh]
retired [lah]
<malay>cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar</malay> [jer]
how does it look like
is it <malay>badan besar rambut putih</malay> [eh]
[oh]
pointed out [ah]
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
ya <malay>macam macam macam seroja</malay> was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
you know to be ya I mean be (err) get get new more books you know but <malay>macam</malay> the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just <malay>macam seroja</malay>
she's just tired you know
and (um)
I think that's the main reason why they retire
[eh] even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine [oh] for you you are millennial I'm not [sia]
you you are I'm not I'm older than you <malay>sayang</malay>
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
(uh) I am a generation X [leh]
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>si si siapa</malay> was telling me these millennials [ah] because it's
it's really the you [lah] but you are not the the the the people that #seroja# and #borshak# was saying [lah]
the they were saying that this millennials [ah] lazy you know lazy [ah]
ya
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right <malay>mana tengok seroja</malay> I <malay>tengok kesian</malay> [ah]
[ah]
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
<malay>dia beli rumah tu</malay> about <malay>satu</malay> point <malay>satu satu</malay> point <malay>dua juta</malay> [tau]
no she said people the
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to (uh) buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house <malay>pun</malay> (err)
(uh) it's slow down <malay>macam orang pun tak nak beli</malay>
so
<malay>rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu</malay> I think
I think ten years [eh] twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even (err) make any profit
(err) around the same price as #seroja#
(uh) (uh)
(uh) <malay>dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak jual</malay>
(uh)
<malay>macam tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak jual harga tinggi</malay> [lah] she just want to sell (uh)
slightly more [lah] or around the same price [lah]
because she already bought a she already got (err) her flat
(err) her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
<malay>dia punya rumah yang ini tingkat dua yang rumah ke sana tu tingkat lapan</malay>
she want to because she love (err) cycling
[ah] and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle <malay>dekat</malay>
her condo <malay>tu</malay> [kan] not near the beach right so <malay>macam</malay>
to her is an effort [lah] to go back and forth <malay>naik basikal di situ</malay> and I think a bit #ulu# [lah] because <malay>situ</malay> [kan] <malay>jauh</malay> [kan]
she like cycling but <malay>macam</malay>
I think she wants to cycle near the beach [lah] she doesn't have to
(uh)
ya [lah] but she has wonderful legs [ah]
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but <malay>macam</malay>
for me when I see her I <malay>tengok</malay> I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
<malay>macam</malay> is typical of (err) they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
<malay>macam</malay> still <malay>tinggal</malay> that <malay>rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual</malay> and still have (err) her she's start to pay ready for her house
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around (uh) ten years or so [ah]
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road [eh]
the amber road I'm not sure maybe [ah]
I think I I don't think is a new condo [ah]
(uh) (uh)
no no hers was second hers was a new <malay>lepas tu dia kata</malay> <malay>ada</malay>
(uh) it's new it's new
[ah] <malay>tapi besar</malay> because <malay>rumah dia belum habis</malay> renovate [eh] because they had to for stall the
(uh)
(uh) the no the the <malay>macam kira</malay> development <malay>dah habis semua tapi orang semua</malay> I think they <malay>nak</malay> renovate [ah] <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi pasal</malay> renovation <malay>kena</malay> put on hold because of the COVID
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
so I was thinking to myself [oh] not bad [eh] <malay>dia tak payah jual rumah</malay> in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to <malay>jual rumah</malay> so <malay>maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta</malay> I mean she's already <malay>nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu</malay> and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
and not having to borrow money from the bank
maybe she has the money <malay>ada duit juga</malay> [ah]
that one <malay>betul-betul ada</malay> (err) pool or view of the pool ya
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
<malay>tiga tiga</malay> bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice <malay>sayang</malay> it was like
[oh] my god sex heaven
(uh) I think I think for <malay>dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal</malay> condo she shared with a flatmates <malay>dulu dia tinggal dekat</malay> <malay>sekarang dia tinggal kat</malay> condo I think she found a new flatmate [eh] and then <malay>macam kat kat</malay> russia [kan] they don't have this quality of
condo [kan]
(uh) so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware [lah] about the development about about buying condo (uh) that #dasha# is aware so <malay>macam macam</malay> it's very sexy [lah]
it's very very nice
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because <malay>dekat itu dekat dengan</malay> russian <malay>nya</malay> embassy
and and then <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit timah# <malay>dia nak dekat dengan</malay> nature <malay>agaknya orang putih gitu</malay> [kan]
[ah] shared <malay>dengan ramai ramai ramai</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I never ask
(uh)
because I thought I I thought she stayed at #serangoon# garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
(uh) (uh)
(uh) but I think she like the location <malay>agaknya</malay>
<malay>dekat dengan rumah dekat dengan dekat kerja agaknya</malay>
(uh) because this <malay>mat salleh</malay> they like their nature they like
(uh) <malay>dia naik</malay> bus <malay>dia dia orang naik</malay> bus
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
because maybe the flatmate <malay>yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya</malay>
!huh!
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask [lah]
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
they're not really <malay>macam kita</malay> a bit rude about money we talk about money like <malay>macam</malay> I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think #dasha# will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about <malay>macam</malay>
especially french so I think it's something that they
<malay>macam</malay> it's not really the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> us <malay>cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual</malay>
(uh)
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very (err) thrifty [lah] [sia]
you <malay>tahu</malay> this this year I don't see her spending anything <malay>dia tak beli baju baru</malay>
rent [eh]
(uh)
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
(mm)
<malay>mungkin dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia ke apa kita tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin ada</malay> boyfriend [lah]
that's why she move (uh)
<malay>kalau</malay> like that okay [eh]
make sense right
(uh) but #sami# <malay>suka</malay>
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam dia dia kata dia ada</malay> swimming pool <malay>kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna</malay> [kan] (uh) that's fixed to me condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam</malay> some of the <malay>aminah punya</malay> friends right they <malay>tinggal</malay> condo [ah]
(uh)
so they are a bit different [lah] their their the way they
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (err) I guess that's <malay>macam</malay> we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence <malay>pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat</malay> they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
their upbringing is different right
(uh) distinction [lah] (uh)
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
<malay>yang pak ali</malay> [eh] you know <malay>pak ali</malay> always get the best grades <malay>macam</malay> dean's lists [lah] #borhan# also the one the radio <malay>warna</malay> right but they were from it doesn't
<malay>macam</malay> ya people used to think that (err)
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so [lah]
(uh)
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best [lah] the best usually not them [lah]
(uh) I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace [eh]
she he ya
ya
he was educated <malay>sayang</malay> he was educated when he was young he was educated in #eton# [tau]
he went to #eton# know that was his socialization [tau]
did I ask him what did you do he's <malay>baba budak orang baba</malay>
[oh] I (uh) my father owns a travel agent company
(uh)
<malay>tak tahu betul ke tidak</malay>
(uh) and then

<malay>dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi</malay> tuition
<malay>dia pergi</malay> tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject

[ah]
(uh) teaching <malay>macam</malay> he has he has his full time job
even after <malay>tu dia</malay> continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so <malay>macam</malay> you know you have this
but he's very nice [lah] I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time <malay>kita</malay> because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you <malay>berbual</malay> and then <malay>dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang</malay> so most of the time we speak <malay>melayu</malay> and <malay>baba</malay> so
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him [oh] can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me [lah] of course [lah] he won't pay for it [lah] but because it's my <malay>mahal</malay> right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there <malay>dia beli dia ingat</malay> I don't know how it is now terrence
I I found out that he was educated at #eton# so I was like #eton# then #dasha# was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to (err) the people in #eton# but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the #eton# boys (err) russian [lah]
#eton# is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
no no no <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> actually <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> singapore
<malay>tapi dia kata dia</malay> not good enough [lah] #dasha# <malay>kata sebab tu</malay> #eton# they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually #eton# then after that the #eton# got
a professor but <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah]
or american [eh] but very fluent in russian and then because (err) project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but <malay>macam macam</malay> russian only a few know
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
[ah] ya
(uh)
(uh huh)

ya and and and the thing is is not just (uh) it's not just vietnam but also (uh) indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
(err) study in russia because russia (uh) (uh) study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year [ah] to brush up on her russia before she
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> be you know why they go to russia because <malay>dia punya</malay> tuition fee
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america (uh) it's recognise [lah]
singapore I <malay>tak tahu</malay> but (uh)
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when (err) #kacha# was telling me #kacha# the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to #sarawak# or #sabah#
so there were (err) she was speaking russian to her husband and <malay>dia</malay> she have two children two or three children they all go to #sabah# or #sarawak# then after that <malay>yang orang kat belakang dia</malay> there's this man [ah] (err) medical doctor
<malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns (err) medicine in russia
(uh)

but she cannot come and work here
<malay>tak</malay> recognise #kelantan# <malay>punya</malay> medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes <malay>dia</malay> come back
(err) to be <malay>dia kerja kat</malay> #mendaki# [kan] <malay>arwah dia</malay> until he very sick already he went over there

to send her daughter to australia
<malay>mahal</malay>
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why <malay>dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka</malay> australia
[ah] because <malay>dia tak</malay> stress [lah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore
the pace of life is different [lah]

[oh]
ya
strength
their strength is languages (uh)
ya
ya
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology <malay>siapa si</malay>
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test [leh]
ya but we we found out from my
<malay>ustazah yang</malay> teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example <malay>yang daripada</malay>
(err) university of
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
jordan and the university of
not cairo [lah] (err) #al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
(uh) it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
it's not considered a degree level <malay>macam</malay> for example you want to be a teacher right
they don't consider a degree for #al-azhar# a degree
yes that's what my <malay>ustaz</malay> told me
so <malay>macam</malay> it has to be like they recognize degree
(uh)
don't know #allahu aalam#
jordan I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
could be [ah] because <malay>mak dia mak dia tak nak</malay> but but but (uh) the <malay>ustaz kata</malay> that's the reason <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>kita dapat</malay> second upper the second upper (uh) or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya
ya that's why like people say why they go to <malay>madrasah</malay> for that's the big question everybody ask
<malay>siapa</malay>
(uh) #wani# [eh]
<malay>agaknya</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know now (err) COVID I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
unless they do online [lah] unless they do online [lah] but I don't know #al-azhar# now not that good [lah]
so that's why a lot of people recommend <malay>pergi</malay> jordan
there's <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
the system of learning [ah]
(err) I think ever since the the egyptian spring [ah] uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time [lah] we know that the story [lah]
[oh] now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
[kan] <malay>itu hari si</malay> king of jordan <malay>datang</malay>
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like <malay>tiga empat daripada</malay> eygpt and then she knows other dialect [lah] so <malay>dia kata ada kesian</malay> because she was telling me because <malay>dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz</malay>
<malay>ustaz hasan</malay> so <malay>dia bilang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia bilang dengan</malay> I [lah] some of them come from <malay>negeri yang</malay> you know they come from <malay>kampung</malay> so only know dialect [tau] <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend [ah]
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
and this lady have a condition [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> then I ask (err) your cousin [eh] how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into [eh] [a'ah] <malay>kak tini bukan senang</malay> you know like <malay>nak kena ni nak kena</malay> surgery <malay>nak kena ni</malay> can you imagine <malay>nak kena</malay> like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime <malay>tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata</malay> and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people <malay>agaknya derma</malay> I think embassy <malay>derma agaknya</malay> and then spend money on them you know (err) spend the money on translations (err) these translators
[oh] ya because the the king would (err) #hussein# not #hussein# I I I <malay>kenal bini dia</malay> (uh) he was very impressed the singapore side very <malay>cepat</malay> very efficient
but when I was telling doctor <malay>ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia</malay> showing off
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
(uh) that is the rumour [lah] that she <malay>tunjuk</malay> the <malay>jam</malay>
(uh) but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
(err) at the
(uh)
(err) visa at the jordianian embassy [ah]
ya but it's also something that has strength [lah] because her #fusha# is very good like the <malay>orang arab dengar</malay> #fusha# [lah] <malay>yang</malay> I try to <malay>berbual dengan ustazah hadijah</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> #fusha# but okay so <malay>macam</malay> the the difficult dialect is not egyptian [lah] according to them [lah] but I don't know I <malay>tengok</malay> egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt <malay>punya</malay> dialect very near #fusha# the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran [lah] you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the #fusha#
<malay>banyak orang arab banyak</malay> [kan] very diverse
that's the that's the thing [lah] so they get whatever they can
<malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> egypt <malay>itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama</malay> she even take she even take #talaqqi# courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take #talaqqi# she taught she taught me how to <malay>tajwid</malay>
she told me <malay>yang</malay> the and then when I ask #abi# #abi# say <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>ada yang ustaz yang</malay> famous <malay>sampai boleh kalau</malay> you <malay>buat salah</malay> your <malay>bacaan sampai boleh ambil</malay> you know your you know the what is that thing [ah]
when they collect the smoke the cigarette <malay>punya</malay> ashes [leh]
(uh) they can throw that at your face
like <malay>garang</malay> [ah]
you know but that is the the the nature [lah] but then you want to get the #sadat# [eh] they call it #sadat# you you want to get #sadat# so you do that [lah]
let her just stay here [lah] let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
let her <malay>bukan</malay> poly <malay>tak boleh pakai tudung pakai</malay> [jer] <malay>tudung kat</malay> poly
(uh)
or you want her to go okay [lah] go <malay>pakai</malay> then there's the other thing [lah]
I think (err) <malay>tengok</malay> appetite <malay>dia macam</malay> math and science
language is a bit hard [lah]
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
(uh)
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength [ah]
in singapore you cannot do well <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I don't think so [lah]
(uh) I mean I have friends who who like for example #murni# and I have a mutual friend
(err) <malay>namanya</malay>
(err) okay [lah] one of our girlfriends [lah]
so I'm not that close to her [lah] because
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] I just <malay>tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat</malay> [lah] but she's very close to #murni# so now she's the
<malay>punya</malay> translation unit she she's the head you know
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
<malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>selalu berbual dengan dia</malay>

thursday
[eh] then <malay>si</malay> #affaf# <malay>macam mana sekolah dia tu</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> what we hear <malay>lepas tu ada kata</malay> start january <malay>ada</malay> start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no [lah] I mean
(err) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I mean the the the
correspondents <malay>tu macam</malay> last time when I go melbourne study [kan]
in #seoul# is one of the agency other agency <malay>pun ada</malay> so like this (uh) uni [oh] kaplan one of it is there any other agency
we went to kaplan to register her
[oh] different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging [oh] no you cannot then you have to go this
uni <malay>mana apa buat</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
it's exam-based also [lah] I mean written written exam
but if there's no choice how <malay>rasa</malay> if
the one that those without the <malay>apa</malay> is without the examining examination <malay>tu macam mana</malay>
how many choices she have
but
so <malay>nak kena ambil</malay> I mean it's the same
line [kan] must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses [eh]
ya I mean with this combination diploma
if she opt to other <malay>macam</malay> early childhood
can she use the diploma or <malay>tak boleh pasal dia tak</malay> bridging
ya example <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] this [one] <malay>ada</malay> the next one is this [one] is (uh) no not examinable
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam [lah] [kan]
no choice
that's two [lah] <malay>satu sama ada dia nak ambil</malay> with examinable
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
and also must know whether the diploma if she has <malay>tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi</malay> [kan]
cause if she wait again <malay>dah</malay> she waste one year <malay>ni dia</malay> wait again <malay>tiga bulan</malay>
<malay>nak buat cepat</malay>
now is december
I thought she say <malay>dia punya sekolah macam</malay>
career gardens <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[orh]
is different course now this the uni is still exist [lah] I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more <malay>kenapa</malay> low intake <malay>ke</malay>
but part time will be what how many years three years
[orh]
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
<malay>apa</malay>
her
[orh]
[ah]
but the thing <malay>kalau macam</malay> because now <malay>pun</malay> she take the bus <malay>pun</malay> she will pay adults fee just no school pass [kan]
then she's no more [ah] means she's tertiary student what
(hmm)
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this [one] is (uh) this [one] the
[ah] bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
(mm) waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that <malay>baik</malay> go to other place [seh]
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out <malay>nanti tak tahu lagi</malay>
ya
(mm)
but I mean does it change if
this is kaplan <malay>tukar dia punya</malay> uni [kan] with these courses
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
can check online <malay>tak</malay>
cause now is limited time [eh] <malay>sekarang dua puluh</malay> plus
I her <malay>other</malay> friends <malay>sekolah mana</malay> private <malay>mana</malay>
kaplan <malay>juga bukan</malay>
with her behaviour <malay>seram</malay>
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside
that's the things [lah] [kan] whether you can be safe or
don't know what's going on
your lifestyle [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>campur-campur orang</malay> okay (uh) <malay>jaga diri</malay>
because <malay>suasana lain</malay> [tau] <malay>suasana</malay> part malaysia <malay>suasana</malay> part <malay>suasana</malay> part
<malay>ada</malay> [tau] [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang si ustaz anak dia</malay> [kan] remember murdoch <malay>apa yang ustaz</malay> #salim# <malay>pun</malay> [kan] you just (uh) go over to malaysia [lah] rather than go
so that's why you have to explore okay with this diploma
what you can when (uh) other uni other places <malay>kena</malay> start <malay>dia punya tu</malay> [kan] then from there
<malay>kalau kata</malay> recognise that's a plus point [lah] [kan] I mean singapore to malaysia <malay>tu</malay> !wah! one more year
one more year one more the amount you have to pay on it ya
don't waste timing

ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya <malay>bila</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> travel <malay>lagi macam</malay> camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
<malay>bila</malay> time <malay>nak makan</malay> we can <malay>makan</malay> or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus <malay>lima puluh</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar</malay> he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
<malay>pergi</malay> pub [eh] <malay>pergi</malay> pub hot chocolate !wow!

I don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate <malay>dekat</malay>
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think

ya
ya
yup yup correct [ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
<malay>yang</malay> the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then <malay>bila</malay> wombat <malay>tu macam bau kita punya makanan</malay> !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come <malay>tak ambil gambar</malay> [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kecoh saje</malay>
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like <malay>kesian</malay> when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay> COVID <malay>pergi mana</malay> [eh]
[eh] but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
<malay>dia penat gila</malay> [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in [lah] like I need my dose of man
ya I really hope this goes away soon [seh] K <malay>tak sabar</malay>
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
<malay>tapi rasa macam</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] <malay>selamat tak</malay> seasick [eh]
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
weirdly I miss the supermarkets <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] <malay>kelakar tak</malay>
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so <malay>lain</malay> right
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that <malay>kita nak</malay> save <malay>duit</malay> [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
I don't know I <malay>rasa apa dah pakai</malay>
(err) wait (err) K let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one <malay>yang kat</malay> farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was <malay>dekat bandar</malay> like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and <malay>macam</malay> all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] <malay>macam</malay> modern
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# <malay>yang mana satu</malay> [seh]
yes yes I remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream <malay>macam bunga</malay> like that <malay>macam</malay> the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but <malay>macam tak</malay> memorable <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
ya but if I had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (err)
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
<malay>tak</malay> I'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
<malay>pening</malay> [seh] I <malay>tengok</malay>
ya
<malay>faham faham</malay>
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
<malay>macam</malay> there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so <malay>macam</malay> you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're <malay>lapar</malay> like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
<malay>borong</malay> market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
<malay>macam</malay> it wasn't it wasn't like popular or <malay>macam</malay> ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like I remember there was one <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] flavour <malay>ni macam</malay> some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
<malay>pisang goreng</malay> is it <malay>pisang goreng</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> they said that it was <malay>pisang muda goreng</malay> or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] <malay>mana nak dapat</malay> [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie <malay>sebelum tu apa</malay>
ya
what's dragon's den <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh]
<malay>ini macam</malay> shark tank <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but I miss (um) ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas <malay>macam masak sendiri</malay> and all [kan]
ya
I do I do like <malay>macam</malay>
like you know when we were craving for
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or <malay>teh tarik</malay> shop and pay an exorbitant amount <malay>untuk beli</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay>
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than <malay>kat sini</malay>
what what what what do you miss
<malay>kau</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or <malay>apa apa yang sedap sangat</malay> [ah]
okay okay
livable boy <malay>sama makan sama hidup</malay> [eh]
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there I think <malay>malam</malay> [eh]
a pie pie face
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! <malay>rindu gila</malay> [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes <malay>kat</malay>
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like
like like I didn't even know something <malay>macam</malay> so basic and simple can taste so <malay>sedap</malay> you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait <malay>apa</malay> what was the filling <malay>dalam</malay> jacket potato <malay>dia lupa</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> order <malay>lagi lepas tu</malay> ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
<malay>sedap sedap sangat sedap</malay>
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and <malay>macam</malay> ya things are just
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita boleh buat kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby <malay>duit</malay> [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
<malay>macam</malay> ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores <malay>pasal dia orang suka</malay> touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
<malay>yang</malay> unbeatable [lah] and ya you I think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand <malay>tapi macam berlambak</malay> [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester
we were so noob man
okay can you jog my memory again york <malay>mana satu</malay>
[oh] and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain [kan] yes yes yes
[eh] it's a once in a lifetime chance [seh] we never know if we are going to pass by that place again [lor]
okay [lah] just want to check it out while we are there <malay>betul aqilah</malay>
so right what [eh] did we go to any theme parks [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay> like I can't remember like during our trip
trying to recall [lah]

enchanted garden or something
<malay>yang ada</malay> the one with the that float what do you call it [ah]
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what is it called [ah]

ya and then (um)
ya I just remember that that thingy [ah] what is it called [ah]
not not rafting [ah] <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
[oh] then <malay>kita ada masuk tu</malay> haunted house haunted house
[kan] <malay>ada macam tempat</malay> I don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip <malay>dekat sana</malay> then <malay>ada</malay> this little like haunted house <malay>yang kita masuk</malay>
<malay>kat atas</malay> [ah] like this house of mirrors or something like that
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to [lah] [eh] but the beaches there were nice [eh]

an abundance of in singapore
ya [eh] but malaysia nature not bad [leh] actually
ya
(mm)
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall [ah]
no [lah] you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies

like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya it can layer on <malay>lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>kat dalam</malay> forests <malay>kena</malay> layer on [seh]
ya but okay [lah] I mean like okay #langkawi# has nice beaches

unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can [ah] while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have (uh) know two thousand maybe
<malay>bila</malay> [seh] how come I don't know
<malay>ni</malay> time uni [eh]
wait what did you go to spain for
[oh]
[eh] but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
but (err) <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean <malay>macam</malay> you've got to plan around your budget and everything [kan]
<malay>jauh gila</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>sabar</malay> belgium is germany right
[oh] okay okay and then <malay>apa jadi</malay>
and then
so wait the cab fare was <malay>mahal gila</malay> or what
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare [ah]
#ish# <malay>rabak</malay> or what
!huh!
so basically you were trying to catch your train (err) trying to catch your flight you mean
[eh] wait back then you guys had like phones and technology with you right or <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ke kau orang macam</malay> were I don't know just winging it
serious
[oh] my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
(mm)
okay okay and like the timing wise
<malay>ada</malay> buffer [lah]
this was towards the end of your trip or <malay>macam mana</malay>
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys [dah] <malay>takde duit apa</malay> [seh]
okay no cash on hand [lah] you mean
okay
(mm) (mm)
[oh] <malay>faham faham</malay> K K and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your <malay>alasan</malay>
(uh huh)
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
[ah] so like he <malay>kena</malay> switched on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter [ah]
[oh] I see like how much it's supposed to cost [ah]
okay okay no [lah] because I'm just wondering <malay>macam</malay> you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
[oh] !wah! were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him [lah]
(mm)
confirm <malay>tengah</malay> panic [eh] <malay>pasal macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat</malay> then you have to find your gate and everything like [oh] my goodness
start of an adventure [eh]
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
<malay>macam macam</malay> what what would (err) the like significant moments of the trip
<malay>ada raih tak kat sana</malay>
[oh] <malay>selamat</malay> [ah] spain <malay>menang</malay>
[eh] wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like <malay>habis</malay>
people will probably be like <malay>maki-maki semua</malay>
ya ya like (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm [ah] <malay>kena jalan balik</malay> [kan]
<malay>jalan balik lepas tu</malay>
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
serious [eh] <malay>roti</malay> and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that
(mm)
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
(mm)
<malay>prata</malay> [eh]
<malay>prata</malay> is everywhere
okay
wait wait wait <malay>sabar sabar kau orang dah</malay> check <malay>harga benda tu ke belum</malay>
okay okay <malay>habis</malay>
alright alright alright so you guys were like <malay>itik dengan ayam</malay> [ah] <malay>berbual</malay>
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like #prata# <malay>bom</malay> [ah] so <malay>kirakan dia ada macam</malay>
but as in they served it on the side or <malay>memang</malay> it's it's really like with the sugar and all
[oh] my so he gave you guys one first or <malay>macam mana</malay>
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the <malay>manis</malay> one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
I see I see
yup
so what siesta time basically <malay>macam</malay> nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never encountered this before so
<malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] madrid
he <malay>pernah kerja</malay> at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large <malay>macam</malay> like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your <malay>ni</malay> the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]

(oo) that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government

K never mind like I <malay>dekat</malay> I I can't recall
(oo)

[lah]
later the zoom
you do alone [eh] I I don't need to join you okay
it's so <malay>leceh</malay>
<malay>malas</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat</malay> zoom zoom <malay>ni</malay> I'm not comfortable [lah] <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>nanti</malay> I keep looking at the teacher while I <malay>dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat</malay> teacher #nadia#
just like sad that her malay teacher <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>cikgu melayu dia cikgu</malay> #hafizah# <malay>dah tak ada</malay> [ah]
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
(err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is there [lah] definitely she's
the first to teach (err) #tasha#
but I believe <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
get the malay students to love
malay
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# make it more interesting
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
when #nadia# is in P three (err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# she's lucky because she knows <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# even before she started
[ah] teaching her so <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
so that's why I think it's a great loss (err) and she's there I think according to #tasha# it's like what she's only there for three years
so #tasha# was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one [lah]
(uh)
#tasha# is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
#tasha# is the first batch she teach three years [lah]
three years [eh] five years
ya initially #tasha# doesn't like her [what]
but in the end
[a'ah] see
her class [what]
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is #nadia# she pick and choose
when when the teacher she <malay>tak suka</malay>
it will affect her this what I notice [ah]
see like the I mean not <malay>apa</malay>
(um) <malay>dia punya</malay> prefect <malay>punya tu</malay>
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around [lah]
because I think
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance [eh] her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her <malay>kakak</malay>
#tasha# #tasha# also [what]
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
at least she got two to her <malay>ni</malay> to her name
which now you don't expect her to dance [lah] she's got no interest already
#nadia# my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that (oo) tag rugby
(oo) touch rugby tag rugby
ya <malay>dia suka panjat-panjat</malay> [pe] <malay>banyak</malay> [pe] they go hiking and everything but then <malay>sekarang</malay>
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego [ah] the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active [lah] she is like she is active since young so
she's the one <malay>yang</malay> climbing all over the place
she's daring [lah] she she has the confidence
can [lah] let her try [lah]
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store [lah] #tasha# #tasha# hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs [lah]
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set [what] knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay [lah]
it belongs to #tasha# or belongs to her
then it should be able to [lah] and #tasha# use
should be [lah] it's kids size [what]
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
[eh] she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
<malay>tak boleh</malay> loose out <malay>ke dia</malay>
<malay>dia takleh kalah</malay> you understand or not
<malay>dia</malay>
that's why <malay>dia main</malay> game <malay>dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dah</malay> I <malay>rasa dah</malay> better [lah] <malay>sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam</malay> #iman# <malay>main nak menang</malay>

very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you [lah] see what they want to eat

don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway [lah] but she haven't message me
I think she's coming from #sengkang# I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later <malay>si</malay> #mas# <malay>ni</malay>
#peck seah# P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start (err) preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time [lah] the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind [ah] if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
they've prepared so much so half a year later <malay>baru dah</malay> towards the end <malay>nak nak nak</malay> <malay>dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat</malay>
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
<malay>kalau tak nanti kelam kabut</malay> because <malay>kalau</malay> you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
but they have they have tuition [what]
#amirah's# (err) siblings they have tuition
[ah]
I thought #amirah# go for (err) (oo) visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
(uh) but math class
my only worry is #nadia's# math I mean ya now she's average [ah] but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
because the thing is for me <malay>dia punya</malay> the the the problem sum [lah]
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is #tasha# cannot help much also with maths
at least science
(err) english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind [lah]
at least if we start her early because we started #tasha# like only in P five
right started #tasha# with five
(hmm)
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as #tasha#
ya she did
<malay>baik</malay> [lah] as long as it's not so expensive [lah] but I think this teachers are

[ah] like massage parlours all <malay>dah tutup</malay>
a lot <malay>yang</malay> know like people with families [lah] with families I think affected them a lot <malay>orang</malay> some of them <malay>macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari</malay> you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over <malay>kesian</malay>
(err) yes (err)
like one of them (err)

just to (err)
(err) so corn is a one year harvest program [lah] something like that
[ah] so if one year harvest corn then one year later

what do you call it the massage spa <malay>abeh</malay> shopping centre
how's the the the the the situation there
[oh] okay okay okay ya see I see I see then when when you come back from (err) #batam# I I know you went #batam# but I when did you went to #batam#
you went there for your business
!huh! that means from singapore you have to fly to #jakarta# first then from #jakarta# quarantine for one night <malay>lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang</malay> then <malay>pergi</malay> #batam# why never go #batam# directly from singapore take ferry
I see
[ah] okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve (err) november
[orh] then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks [lah] [ah]
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain [lah] facebook [lah] they say not nice [lah] some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from #batam# or is there any requirement that you need to get
okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] okay okay okay so you you
#batam# from #batam# you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront
okay okay #tanah merah# because you know just recently I heard I read this news you know this singaporean that have not return back from singapore for seventeen years [ah] <malay>dia cakap macam macam</malay> nazi [lah] <malay>macam</malay> world war two [lah] <malay>kena halau sana halau sini</malay> I not sure whether it's true or not [lah] but

very
[ah] it's just probably he never come back to singapore for seventeen years [lah] probably
[ah] maybe
[ah] so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like <malay>macam</malay> nazi [lah] but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information <malay>lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini</malay> probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason [ah]
ya [lah] too much [lah] this one [ah] anyway [ah] so your two weeks how okay everything
[ah] okay [lah] because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have #sentosa# hotel I don't know [lah] these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning [ah] <malay>betul tak</malay> then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
[ah]
[ah]
[orh]
okay [lah] #alhamdulillah# [lah] at least okay <malay>apa</malay> at least something [kan] <malay>daripada takde apa-apa</malay> then <malay>kalau kata orang tu kalau tak nak tak nak tak nak bayar</malay> then <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>keluar duduk kat</malay> singapore [jer] <malay>betul tak</malay>

talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks [dah] end of the year already !wah! very fast man correct or not [ah]
!alamak!
[ah]
new year <malay>tahun ini</malay> <malay>jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak</malay>
<malay>betul betul betul</malay> I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd [lah] so
<malay>kemungkinan</malay>
<malay>apa-apa yang</malay> countdown <malay>semua dekat</malay> neighbourhood estate [jer] [lah]
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning [lah] <malay>macam</malay> north east south west <malay>ke apa</malay> so <malay>kat mana-mana yang</malay> okay <malay>kau tinggal</malay> north <malay>ada bunga api tinggal</malay> south <malay>ada bunga api</malay> west <malay>ada bunga api</malay> so instead of going to the central <malay>punya bunga api</malay> so everybody goes your own division their own area their own <malay>kampung</malay> to enjoy [lah] but anyway I mean
this is a new beginning [ah] they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know [lah] [ah] I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
singapore <malay>bila</malay>
sixteen march <malay>ke</malay>
sixteen march [eh]
sixteen march <malay>dia orang tutup</malay> sixteen march <malay>sekali kira</malay> march april may june july august september november [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sembilan bulan</malay> [ah]
but but very fast [ah] nine months
<malay>pejam celik pejam celik dah</malay> nine months <malay>dah nak masuk satu tahun</malay>
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one [ah] that's what they said is probably two two [lah] so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
(mm)
okay [lah] spend money in singapore [lah] staycation now government give [ah] hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel [lah] I think you have to book to those but five platform only
<malay>tak</malay>
you no need to take <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [what] what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
the places that you want to go (err) places of interest or staycation
you have to book through these five different platform okay (err) <malay>yang satu</malay> #changi# and then (err) I think trip (err) there's another three more [lah] <malay>aku tak ingat mana satu</malay> (err) then
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass [ah] and then from there then you can use [lah] you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself [ah] you can use that or you can use partly the only thing <malay>yang</malay> you cannot do <malay>yang kau tak boleh buat</malay> is <malay>kau buat</malay> stack up <malay>maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>dua ratus kita</malay> stay in hotel for free [ah] <malay>itu tak boleh tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can (uh) offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up [ah] that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it [lah] so in the domination of ten meaning let say <malay>kalau kau</malay> example <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> zoo <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars [lah] or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that [ah] <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> combine [lah] that's how it goes but
okay [lah] they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore [lah] but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one [lah] so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period [ah]
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to <malay>kelam-kabut kata orang</malay> [kan] [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah] next year <malay>pun boleh</malay> january <malay>pun boleh</malay> february <malay>pun boleh</malay> as long as <malay>pakai sebelum</malay> july [lah] so ya
<malay>kau belum pernah pergi</malay> sea aquarium [ah] [eh] talking about sea aquarium <malay>aku pun pernah pergi</malay> [ah] adventure cove
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
[eh]
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo #jurong# bird park #sentosa# I don't want [lah] so all these places went already [ah] so I need to go something different [ah] maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night [ah] maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels [lah] you want to go those like hotel [ah] of course you need to come out still same price [lah] not much difference [ah] anyway
ya
[ah]
serious [ah]
government give us [ah]
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>mampus</malay>
[ah] okay okay I understand
[ah] so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing [lah]
!huh!
<malay>macam mana boleh tak</malay> orginal <malay>ada potong potong ke mampus</malay> <malay>kat mana ni kat</malay> #batam# <malay>ni</malay> indonesia [lah]
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah [lah] example [ah] one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
<malay>dia ambil</malay> they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end <malay>sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>kurang</malay> [ah] !wah! <malay>ini macam pun boleh</malay> [eh] <malay>mati</malay>
<malay>kesempatan dalam kesempitan</malay>
<malay>mampus</malay> take advantage of the whole situation [lah] to get something [ah]
be quite too expensive or what
no
!huh!
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
!huh! I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then (uh) hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up [what] then what's the point of
<malay>takut</malay>
<malay>takut daripada</malay> negative <malay>jadi</malay> positive
!huh!
bullshit
!huh!
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive [what] right so why is the other way round
what the
<malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>betul-betul punya tak faham</malay>
really happen
until now [ah]
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
[oh] that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better [what]
funny [ah]
why [ah] like that
anyway
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
ya
[oh] ya ya #saiful# one so touching [ah] I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that <malay>pergi kat semberang tambak</malay> #johor# and and one of them <malay>dekat</malay> woodland one of them <malay>dekat</malay> #johor# <malay>dekat apa tu tempat tu</malay> [eh] [eh]
is this correct <malay>entah mana tempat tu</malay>
[ah] [ah]
they they they can see #johor# [kan] <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> wife <malay>dekat ni</malay> [kan] #skudai# [kan] [eh] <malay>bukan dekat</malay> #setulang# [kan]
[ah] and then go and then he video call and then he wave at the wife using binoculars [oh] my god so cute
very the romantic lucky never go viral maybe [ah] maybe whoever pick up that story [ah] and then share share share share [ah]
I do not know [ah] shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is #johor# one is #woodlands# so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet [ah] whoever pick up that story [ah] go viral [ah]
no [lah] he I think yes he no [eh]
this year ya correct correct because right right right
correct because why we wanted to go for his wedding that was [ah] ya ya we wanted to go for his wedding in so everybody was applying for leave #marhan# was also asking for leave then #iskandar# was asking me [eh] bro <malay>boleh pinjam kereta nak pergi masuk</malay> #johor# <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> [lah] <malay>kereta masuk</malay> #johor# because of
(err) #saiful# wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID <malay>semua tarik-tarik</malay> then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore [ah] those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end <malay>tak jadi pergi</malay> but #alhamdulillah# they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia [what] so <malay>kat</malay> malaysia <malay>semua</malay> cancel [kan] everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that [ah] I think during that period still
people are still <malay>was-was</malay> fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual (err) wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel [kan] for him
and then the wife is there but lucky he get married in singapore then after that go <malay>sanding dekat</malay> #johor# [kan] ya ya ya true true true true
ask his wife to come singapore [ah] bring in
he is going back to #johor#
so he's
no but singapore <malay>pun ada</malay>
singapore <malay>boleh</malay>
then after that he's
ya but the <malay>nikah dekat</malay> singapore <malay>kan</malay> #johor# okay
[oh] he is going back #johor# now
then
no pay leave two months [lah] singapore no pay leave two months [ah]
[ah] then after that bring in the wife come singapore
!huh!
<malay>tak tahu</malay> because if not have to pay still have to pay [what] that means he if he bring his wife
[oh] ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia #johor# you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation [lah]
<malay>empat ribu enam ratus ringgit ringgit dah macam</malay> divide by three one thousand plus [lah] so he has to stay two weeks first in the hotel for stay home I mean (err) [lah] consider
but singapore
the the the cases zero [what] community wise why go there still still need to
stay for two weeks instead of seven days <malay>kelakar betul</malay> [lah] malaysia <malay>ini</malay>
subsidise [lah]
I mean if if if now (err) the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go #johor# knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now
<malay>buat apa nak tunggu sampai dua minggu juga</malay>
<malay>asal dua minggu tak tujuh hari</malay> #johor# <malay>pun kelakar juga</malay>
malaysia <malay>ni</malay>

so for me nowadays you you see my new family #cusina#
[oh] ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing [ah] because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation [eh] whereby if let's say you go to
any restaurants or you go to online or you want you know singaporeans being singaporeans we want to taste a lot of foods I mean that is nice there is is a nature is a niche correct so <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a lot of <malay>macam</malay>
food [eh] asian food [eh] <malay>kau kata</malay> [kan] japanese chinese korean
thai vietnamese
that is all halal [tau] in southeast don't talk about malaysian food indonesian food [lah] <malay>banyak kat</malay> singapore if you talk about talk about japanese halal food there is a lot okay coming up
you are talking about chinese halal food <malay>banyak ada</malay> [kan] you're talking about thai halal there is thai vietnamese are halal <malay>ada</malay> so
indian okay [lah] they have <malay>tak payah cakap</malay> [ah] western so many fusion food you go to arab street you see from one end to one end a lot of fish and chips whatever was so I was thinking I was asking my girlfriend hopefully [lah] #inshaallah# [eh] <malay>kalau mungkin jadi isteri</malay> [kan] I was asking her [eh]
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
[ah] is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and (err) gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place [lah] be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put (err) (err) (err)
different taste local of a filipino taste [lah] so yes we did that already so #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
and then (err) lemon herbs and then the other one is portuguese spicy so all filipino <malay>punya</malay> taste [lah] so okay [lah] #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in so we are doing that and then (err) come out into pasta and we are coming up into some filipinos taste [lah] so hopefully
home made [ah]
hopefully [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
correct
[ah]
[ah]
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully [lah] [ah] be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet [lah] because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first (uh) (uh)
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it (err)
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert [lah] then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
and thai tea made made made of thai tea [lah] crepes and everything and just this simple (err) food of (uh) tea I think tea tea thailand and (uh) crepes and and (err) of course she use to be an air stewardess but now she because she of this COVID everything right so she open a home based business [lah] #alhamdulillah# it was it was people like accepting it and that they order and I was like [eh] not bad [ah] and she's basically just a local doing thai milk tea and thai crepes only (uh) <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia punya kirakan dia punya</malay> ingredient [ah]
okay [lah] good [lah] I was thinking
correct
true
ya [lah]
so ya [lah] so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully [lah] hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit [lah]
so I I I I will add you don't worry I will add your I know who is this #toklang# right should I accept should I not this is a scam later somebody I also do not know then after that add already [ah] this one [ah] could you give me money this one transfer here !oi! so many nowadays so that why I worried since you say that is your account I will accept and I will add you

<malay>tadi</malay> a bit fun [lah] okay so
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay [lah] that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
petty a petty reason for me to dislike someone would definitely be his his or her <malay>punya</malay> (um)
(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
okay [lah] okay okay okay <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>orang tu nak</malay> hang out <malay>dengan</malay> I right <malay>tapi dia macam</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak macam kawan dia</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak dengan</malay> members <malay>dia semua</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
(uh)
[ha] okay
<malay>apakah</malay> okay wait wait wait
<malay>ceritakan suatu pengalaman yang sebenarnya lucu tetapi mungkin tidak lucu pada masa itu</malay>

(uh huh)
!huh! okay
(uh) <malay>cerita kelakar</malay>

you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house [ah]
!huh!
ya ya what do think of the house [ah]
(mmhmm)
keep talking [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean for me ya [lah] I mean it's I do feel
I mean once in a while like I do feel <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>sedih</malay> that
<malay>yang apa ni</malay>
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
I mean certain things you like a bit <malay>sedih</malay> right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah]
ya
your your your your new phone <malay>masih banyak</malay> battery [kan]
you just get <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health <malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
(um)

<malay>ia diberi</malay>
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like (mm) ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
okay [lah] the first night the the the first night was a bit <malay>seram</malay>

(um) we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
(mm) where they were that was really really very nice and then (um)
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went #tehran#
we didn't have a guide like what we had (uh) in #isfahan# and #yazd#
[eh] no no no we didn't have #yazd# it's #shiraz# sorry ya
but
ya [lah] we didn't have a guide [lah]
would have been nice [lah] if we had a guide [ah] but we didn't have a guide
ya
ya actually we should have stayed there longer the fact that it was was [ah] lift <malay>tak cukup</malay>
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
<malay>ye ke</malay>

<malay>tu</malay> best <malay>gila</malay> really really <malay>betul-betul</malay> best <malay>gila</malay>
okay to be honest with you right to be completely honest with you the summer trips the best one <malay>yang kat</malay> france
ya <malay>yang kita pergi</malay> #nice# #saint-tropez#
(uh) #biarritz#
no yes we did we went to #biarritz# we went to #cannes#
yes we did go to #biarritz# we went to we went to #biarritz# <malay>dengan</malay> your aunty [eh]
yes
[kan] [kan] <malay>kita</malay> [kan]
[kan] <malay>kita pergi</malay> [kan] <malay>kita pergi</malay> #nice# [eh] no <malay>kita gi</malay> #bordeaux#
then from #bordeaux# we went ya we went to (uh) #dune du pilat#
and then we went to #biarritz#
ya and then we went to #arcachon# ya
and then after that we went to #nice# then from #nice# we went to #saint-tropez# <malay>kita gi</malay>
<malay>kita gi</malay> #cannes# and (um)
#saint-tropez# #cannes# and <malay>tak tahu mana lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>situ</malay> [jer] [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak tahu nak berbual apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh] I <malay>tangok yang tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] (oo) they got a lot of question
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like <malay>tukar</malay> and then <malay>cakap bahasa melayu</malay>
you know <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way <malay>nak cakap melayu</malay> all the way because
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay>
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay> means like I'm about to cry you know like I'm about to
I'm about to really go deep
with my feelings but when I say I'm expressing like I just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when I say I <malay>nak luahkan perasaan kat</malay> you [ah]
<malay>maknanya</malay> I <malay>macam ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cakap sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena</malay> (uh)
<malay>nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena cakap</malay> [lah]
then <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> <malay>macam berat sangat</malay>
<malay>macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal</malay> !wah! see
<malay>janggal</malay>
you you <malay>tak tahu makna janggal</malay> you <malay>teka makna janggal apa</malay>
just <malay>teka</malay> [lah]
yes ya
<malay>janggal maknanya</malay> awkward
yes
[eh] no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
<malay>jap jap jap jap</malay> let me check <malay>yang ni</malay>
<malay>jap jap jap jap</malay> I reply <malay>kak su jap</malay> [eh]

okay <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay <malay>mari kita tengok soalan-soalan yang lain</malay>
<malay>sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu</malay>
don't know okay okay I <malay>tanya lagi</malay> [eh]
<malay>sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu</malay>
soalan pertama fahamkan anda</malay>
you <malay>faham tak</malay>
no
(mm) okay <malay>mahir tu apa</malay>
no <malay>kemahiran</malay> is skills

<malay>serta-merta serta-merta</malay> is immediately ya or instantly [lah]
right <malay>sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu</malay>
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
(mmhmm) okay
why
(uh huh)
[ah] okay
(uh huh)
<malay>mana</malay> [lah] I <malay>tahu</malay> you <malay>tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>diri sendiri</malay>
okay I'm I'm actually going to attempt to speak malay in this [ah] okay <malay>kemahiran yang pertama yang yang ingin saya</malay>
<malay>yang ingin saya</malay> [oh] my god what is that thing
[eh] <malay>mana dia</malay>
[eh] <malay>jap jap jap jap kemahiran yang pertama ialah</malay>

I believe
okay
okay
okay <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
<malay>suatu hari</malay>
<malay>anda bangun dari tidur dan mendapati bahawa anda telah menjadi seorang pelakon</malay>
<malay>siapakah pelakon itu dan mengapa anda memilihnya</malay>
okay
<malay>pelakon</malay>
<malay>yang saya</malay>
(um) <malay>memilih</malay>
[ah] <malay>ialah</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
<malay>siapa yang jadi</malay> spiderman <malay>yang barunya yang</malay> the latest one tom holland ya
<malay>saya ingin menjadi</malay> tom holland <malay>kerana</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) <malay>sungguh</malay> (um)
(uh) talented
I have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)
that <malay>dia muda</malay>
<malay>saya ingin menjadi muda kembali</malay>
(uh)
<malay>muda dan</malay> (uh) <malay>berjaya</malay>
ya tom holland
<malay>bagaimana pula dengan anda</malay>
<malay>pilihan</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay <malay>kejap jap jap</malay>
okay (um)
[eh] <malay>jap jap</malay> you know what I want to <malay>tengok</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your brother <malay>hantar</malay>
then <malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
ya <malay>satu jam kena berbual satu jam</malay>
just <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>satu jam</malay> the no okay the thing is I think what the
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now I'm speaking in english and then suddenly I <malay>tukar</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> you <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
I think <malay>saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila</malay>
<malay>yang paling mustahak ialah apabila</malay>
<malay>dan kenapa</malay>
<malay>dan dari situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>memberi</malay> (uh)
<malay>kesinambungan</malay>
<malay>bagaimana</malay>
<malay>dan apabila</malay>
(uh) <malay>diorang diorang ingin</malay> (um)
<malay>diorang ingin mengetahui</malay>
<malay>cara-cara</malay>
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk <malay>ni semua</malay> we don't really
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where I can just easily go in go out <malay>nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap</malay> english <malay>cakap</malay> english
and
then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] but the fact that <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> certain words <malay>macam</malay> like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like <malay>macam</malay> !alah!
ya
ya <malay>macam dia macam tak</malay> natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes <malay>lagi dua puluh minit sahaja</malay> okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I <malay>nak tengok yang</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your your brother <malay>hantar tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] I'm glad that they that the <malay>yang</malay> [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
<malay>nasib baik tu yang benda tu</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dah habis</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
ya <malay>rumah kita besar</malay> [sia]
yes
[a'ah] <malay>macam lama</malay> [sia]
no [lah] I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> first first christmas
to fully <malay>pindah</malay> but I mean we can slowly live there
my things I'm gonna <malay>letak sikit-sikit</malay> [tau] I'm not gonna like one time go there I'm just gonna put things bit by bit because I <malay>takde kotak</malay>
I probably gonna take a few <malay>kotak</malay> and all that for of course office
<malay>muat ke</malay>
[oh] <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] ya
I really <malay>suka</malay> the <malay>yang kitanya</malay> flooring flooring <malay>kita cantik</malay>
ya
[ah] [oh]
<malay>yang yang kerusi belakang tu kena</malay> screw [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>semua</malay> [ah] <malay>semua kena buat</malay> [ah]
if <malay>ikat</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam kelakar</malay> [eh] <malay>takde</malay> <malay>kat dalam bilik ni</malay> [eh]
[ah] [sia] <malay>besar</malay> [seh]
I mean <malay>kita boleh pergi</malay> later
we can go later we can go tomorrow
!wah! [eh] the counter <malay>tak cantik</malay> [ah]
yup
no [lah] <malay>kita kena kena kena letak dulu</malay> [pe] [oh] <malay>takleh</malay> [eh]
okay so okay
!ee! best [lah] I <malay>tengok</malay> I I I <malay>tengok</malay> the kitchen best [seh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh]
I think the kitchen <malay>cantik</malay> [ah] like after we <malay>letak</malay> after the <malay>apa ni</malay> the
<malay>dia</malay>
ya
after <malay>dia letak</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap</malay>
I think the whole idea <malay>yang</malay> [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
I kinda like it though
<malay>ye ke</malay>
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] <malay>ini diorang boleh</malay> spray [eh]
okay
so <malay>yang ni nanti nanti</malay> next few days <malay>baru pasang</malay> [ah]
<malay>kena tunggu benda tu kering</malay> [eh]
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
<malay>besar sikit</malay> [tau] <malay>tebal sikit</malay> actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya <malay>lebih tebal sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
if were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be [ah] <malay>ni ni</malay> <malay>ni ni soalan</malay> best
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
<malay>pilihan pertama</malay>
<malay>adalah satay</malay>
<malay>satay lembu</malay>

(uh) <malay>ketupat sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi kuah satay banyak-banyak banyak letak banyak bawang banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>banyak bawang</malay> and <malay>banyak timun</malay>
(uh)
ya <malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>

<malay>tahu tak apa</malay>
don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
[eh] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti</malay> [lah] miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
<malay>kita nak buat buat</malay> [seh]
(um) you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling <malay>atau lepas</malay> COVID <malay>nak pergi mana</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> before COVID
(um) I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand [ah] most
(um) I won't say most value for money <malay>tapi dekat</malay>
(um) <malay>dengan dia lawa</malay>
ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah] I think [ah] that time I <malay>pergi</malay> in twenty
sixteen <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> (um)
okay [ah] I <malay>tak</malay> I didn't get to enjoy
fully because it was in a tour
<malay>tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah</malay> go camper van <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dengan</malay> go
(uh) australia I <malay>rasa kalau kita dapat</malay> camper van <malay>kat</malay> new zealand
confirm <malay>lawa gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi kalau macam</malay>
<malay>kita punya</malay> camper van <malay>berlubang</malay>
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay [lah] tasmania best [lah] <malay>sebab dapat naik</malay> the ocean liner [kan] travel from melbourne to tasmania <malay>tapi</malay>
(um) sydney <malay>dengan</malay> sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family <malay>yang</malay> follow <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> best [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> you enjoy more with them
there are shared memories together [ah]
[oh] berry van [eh]
ya <malay>lepas tu yang kita</malay> you <malay>makan kat</malay> perfect catch
<malay>tu pun</malay> best [ah] fish and chips by the river power [sia]
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to <malay>punya</malay> fish and chips fish and chips
<malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak sedap</malay>
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
ya I went to new zealand <malay>dengan</malay> my aunties [lah] and my cousins
(err) well (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>pergi dengan</malay> (um) <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang punya</malay> level of (err) worry is more because they feel that they are responsible [lah] for you
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
I <malay>tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> you <malay>dah dengan makcik-makcik</malay> I
(err) <malay>dia orang dah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah]
and ya [lah] so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then [lah] my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
<malay>dia dah pergi</malay> counter <malay>dah pergi bayar</malay>
<malay>alih-alih</malay> he was walking on the platform
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya (um) and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
[ah] despite my aunts' protestations
and ya [lah] so he jump [ah] he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply [lah] [kan] you got there
it must be ticked are you fit <malay>ada sakit apa-apa tak</malay> you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera <malay>benda-benda macam gini semua biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> fill
and once you are done ya [lah] I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
so they give you a cert [lah] to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and #nah# <malay>ambil kau punya</malay> cert
ya
actually for new zealand (um)
the year that I went
so <malay>kita dalam kat</malay> new zealand maybe about one or two
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so
my cousin and <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub
<malay>tak tak minum</malay> [ah] [eh] [ah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub ordered hot chocolate
<malay>kita pergi</malay> pub <malay>pergi</malay> pub (err) hot chocolate <malay>tengok bola kat luar</malay>
<malay>tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan</malay> it was raining
(um) and then <malay>bila esok pagi</malay>
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> (um) snow fell
<malay>lepas tu bila</malay> when there was snow (err) we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
(um) the advisory was <malay>tak boleh</malay> drive on the road <malay>dulu</malay>
and then (um) apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow <malay>yang</malay> christchurch (um) felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so <malay>macam lama gila</malay> [ah] <malay>lama tak boleh</malay> snow <malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err)
[eh] did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
[ah] was that the first time I felt snow
ya <malay>betul</malay> I think that was the first time I <malay>rasa</malay> snow
(err) unique experience [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> snow [kan] so
ya ya ya we <malay>memang kita tahu</malay> it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves [lah]
(err)
(err) not for snow but I mean just winter <malay>kita tak tahu pun</malay> there was snow that was gonna happen
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun [lah]
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch <malay>maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana</malay>
the tour company decided okay nevermind we (err) board the bus and <malay>lepas tu</malay> drove to another hotel
and (um) ya we basically <malay>tidur kat</malay> hotel <malay>baru</malay>
<malay>tapi yang tak</malay> #bestnya# <malay>pasal</malay> new zealand
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine [eh]
(um) winter obvious <malay>sejuk lepas tu</malay>
winter <malay>sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis</malay>
<malay>semua benda semua kedai dah tutup</malay> then so it was quite boring [lah] for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that !wow! at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but <malay>tengok</malay> so it was kind of boring [ah] but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night <malay>ke</malay> two extra night
ya
K [lah] how chocolate is the best [lah]
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
so hot chocolate [ah] <malay>sedap</malay>
<malay>tu bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> some pumpkin spice [kan]
[ah] apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
<malay>dekat</malay> queen victoria market [kan]
[ah] [eh] <malay>tu biasa pasal kita terus makan</malay> donut <malay>dia kat luar</malay>
!woo! #shiok# [ah]
!wah! camper van experience <malay>lain</malay> [eh] I think
<malay>kat mana</malay>
wilsons promontory
<malay>betul</malay>
dapat
(mm) ya [lah] I think by then <malay>kita orang macam dah penat</malay> I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then (uh) by the time nightfall <malay>kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan</malay> until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal [lah] having wildlife a wombat <malay>benda yang</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak kat</malay> singapore <malay>tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk</malay> camper van
<malay>melampau</malay> [jer]
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food [ah] [kan]
ya <malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah]
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
<malay>kita tak akan dapat</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda macam ini sebab</malay> tours chances are
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
(err)
ya
ya and I think (um) partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> your time is yours
(um) you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
(um) you can even decide on the spot that !hey! I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I think <malay>yang</malay> even on that trip [lah] <malay>yang</malay> we <malay>kita turun tengok</malay> the river delta [kan] ya
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak tak sabar tunggu ni</malay> COVID <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination [lah] I'm don't even wanna go
I just gonna shoot straight for
ya <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
<malay>jadi kita kasih</malay> [lah] <malay>orang yang nak</malay> fly fly <malay>dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi</malay>
<malay>kita pergi apa yang kita mampu</malay> [jer] <malay>iaitu</malay> K
<malay>apa</malay>
wanna drive all the way (um)
ya <malay>tapi</malay> okay so there are two ways to go about doing it <malay>biasa orang</malay> drive
what they do is they drive
to #penang#
<malay>lepas tu tidur</malay> rest one night and then <malay>esok pagi</malay> just <malay>sambung pergi</malay> border of thailand
ya that one more relax [ah] <malay>takde kelam kabut takde macam</malay> rushing for time
<malay>kalau nak lagi rilek</malay>
drive <malay>ke</malay> <malay>tidur semalam</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> #penang#
<malay>nanti</malay> [lah] <malay>belum buka</malay> <malay>tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar</malay>
#selangor# <malay>tengah</malay> highest for COVID numbers
ya so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu lepas dah tidur</malay> <malay>satu malam pergi</malay> #penang# <malay>satu malam baru pergi</malay> thailand <malay>tapi tu dah kira dua hari</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau nak cepat</malay> then <malay>tidur</malay> #penang# <malay>satu hari esok kita pergi</malay> thailand <malay>ataupun lagi nak cepat terus</malay> to thailand [ah] <malay>tapi penat</malay> [ah] <malay>badan sebab</malay> it will probably be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>empat belas jam</malay> on the road [ah] so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired [ah]
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border [oh] you see
so to me
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand <malay>kalau</malay> the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
then the other alternative is fly to
#krabi# or fly to #phuket#
<malay>sewa kereta kat sana</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> travel around southern thailand
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(err) I don't know [ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay> try <malay>tapi jangan bawa kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>jangan bawa kereta</malay> in
you <malay>sewa kereta dekat</malay> thailand
ya
<malay>kalau bawa kereta sendiri</malay> then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring [lah] so what I want is <malay>kita</malay> save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore [ah]
<malay>naik kapal terbang nak sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>kapal terbang</malay> [ah] <malay>naik</malay> [ah] <malay>kapal terbang</malay>
ya
true but then I felt that okay [lah] I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience [lah] of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship [lah] [kan]
okay [lah] <malay>memang</malay> best [lah] <malay>tak cakap tak</malay> best <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] bruny boring [lah] <malay>kirakan macam</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> kecil <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>tu juga</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> bunker [lah] cabin [lah]
cabin cabin
ya
okay [lah] <malay>tapi malam</malay> we <malay>kita tak</malay> travel <malay>malam</malay> so you were travelling at
it wasn't that bad
no [lah] I guess when it got
I mean <malay>bila kita baru-baru masuk</malay> when the boat started to sail
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
by the time <malay>kita dah tertidur</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled [lah] [kan] when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and <malay>dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat</malay> [lah]
then <malay>bila pagi dah bangun</malay>
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm [lah]
[ah]
[oh] ya
<malay>tak</malay>
ya I think supermarkets overseas [ah]
<malay>lain</malay> okay [lah] I mean <malay>dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi</malay> I think because of the space that they have
(um) there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
and <malay>harga tak</malay> so <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
because they are the producers [ah] that's why
[ah] meat so fresh
ya because they are fresh produced [ah] <malay>benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap</malay>
<malay>lagipun bila kita kat sana</malay>
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
<malay>memang</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] since
[oh] <malay>dapat dia orang yang</malay> burger <malay>ni macam</malay> best [ah]
true
even the ice cream is different
okay <malay>sabar</malay> which one do you prefer you <malay>lagi suka</malay> van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> ice cream <malay>ke</malay> you <malay>lagi suka</malay> gelato #messina#
van diemen's was ya <malay>betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah</malay> farm
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] gelato #messina# <malay>ada macam-macam</malay> flavour
<malay>tapi yang</malay> #amorino# <malay>punya</malay>
#amorino# <malay>punya</malay> I think <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>kejap</malay> I <malay>tak ingat</malay> whether that one were trip <malay>ke</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak salah tu</malay> [ah]
okay
ya I like #messina# better <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
ya <malay>tu yang</malay> best <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
because you have a variety to choose from [ah]
because <malay>kalau</malay> you you compare van diemen's van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> flavours are
much more predictable in that sense
it's not anything out of the ordinary [lah] <malay>macam</malay> K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
[kan] <malay>atau</malay>
K [lah] apple cranberry <malay>pun boleh katakan</malay>
quite common
<malay>ada apa yang dekat tu dekat</malay> tom's palette
<malay>dia tak ada ke</malay>
okay tom's palette <malay>ke</malay> gelato #messina#
ya <malay>ke</malay>
but then tom's palette <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
(mm) ya
and the best donuts in the world
[eh] do you notice
it could be ya
<malay>tapi</malay> it could also be the fact that
<malay>benda tu kita tak pernah</malay> try [ah] <malay>contoh</malay> [eh] <malay>contoh</malay>
when we went to <malay>borong</malay> market alright K break your head right
we ordered the the bombolinis [lah] the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
(um)
I I wouldn't say that <malay>sebab dulu</malay> dunkin donut <malay>pernah ada</malay> with their bavarian cream
<malay>tapi</malay> the the ones that dunkin donut <malay>jual tak sesedap</malay> [ah]
and
ya okay so <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine [ah] break your head you <malay>punya</malay> donut the dough is soft
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique (um) overflowing
<malay>inti dia penuh</malay> [kan]
so they were oozing out and okay [lah] I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world [lah]
which I am inclined to agree <malay>sebab</malay> about I haven't tasted
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya [oh] and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
<malay>tak pada</malay> I <malay>macam lebih pada</malay> okay like
I felt that it was a cross between <malay>lemak cili padi dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> thai green curry
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>iras-iras dia</malay>
plantains [eh]
did they grill that one grill [kan]
I think it was grilled and then they put (um) brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that [ah]
ya that one
[eh] there was something that I thought about (um) [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] (um) london (um)
the devil brownies [ah]
ya that was a random find [ah] no we went to that
that weekend market
(um) I wouldn't say it's a random find [lah] because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
[ah] correct
<malay>beutl betul betul</malay>
<malay>dah dah lepas tu</malay> I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den [ah] dragon's den dragon's den is this (uh) british show
where aspiring business owners visit this there (err) these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons [ah] so these dragons are
investors <malay>yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak</malay> shark tank [ah] <malay>macam</malay> shark tank [ah]
so dragon's den <malay>dengan</malay> shark tank <malay>lebih kurang</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay> [ah]
(um) so ya she pitch her brownies to them [ah]
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not [ah] but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted <malay>kirakan</malay> you <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
(err) she used that as part of her advertisement [lah]
[ah] but I really good are really really good
ya okay think about it [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> you miss the food overseas
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
no [lah] just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay [lah] when travel <malay>kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak</malay> most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam makan kat</malay> noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
[ah] noodle oodle (um) that's just
soup [ah]
right like like <malay>mi dengan</malay>
ya so if you were to think about it again <malay>macam</malay> is it really that fantastic
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>faham tak</malay>
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
ya it's the spices <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> okay imagine nandos
K imagine nandos [ah] so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
[ah] the price the price is way cheaper than nandos [ah]
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
so nandos [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam</malay> up <malay>sikit</malay>
[kan] <malay>ada sudu garfu</malay>
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab [ah]
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
[ah] yes
[eh] the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name [ah] a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice [ah]
ya what else [ah]
what else was nice that we have
[oh] buffet that that buffet was power
[eh] that was a nice chance upon [ah]
that was not in our initial plan [lah] because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
(um) ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay [lah] it's a saving grace [lah]
it's a saving grace because I think
(um) those ya that jacket potato was nice
that thick milkshake <malay>sedap gila</malay>
ya it was milkshake and skittles [ah]
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian [lah] at least [oh] that was some nice jacket potato
<malay>tak boleh</malay> replicate [ah] [eh] so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop <malay>kita masuk</malay>
K [ah] <malay>penat saje nak duduk</malay>
and baam <malay>sedap gila apa tempat ni</malay>
ya
that's true
<malay>betul juga</malay> okay [lah] maybe I think [oh] what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] factory outlets
[kan]
ya cheaper [lah] ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands (err) on prada
understand [ah] it's still thousands [eh]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> bicester village elite [ah] up [ah]
bicester <malay>ke</malay> #bister#
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester [eh]
B I C E S T E R bicester
ya but I think the york <malay>punya</malay> outlets (err) better [ah]
york <malay>yang kita punya kita punya</malay> camper van (um) battery <malay>mati</malay>
yes
<malay>tak yang</malay> job <malay>dia</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita dah</malay>
somewhere near the south
so <malay>kita</malay> travel all the way up <malay>untuk pergi</malay> york
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
that's true [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> travel <malay>untuk</malay> two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that <malay>macam</malay> (mm)

[oh] sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay [lah] I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
is partly because of the weather [kan] they humid <malay>tapi dia panas</malay> [ah]
so <malay>walaupun masuk hutan</malay> (err) I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
<malay>tapi bila kat dalam panas juga</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab takde angin</malay> [ah]
compared to <malay>bila kita</malay> travel <malay>dekat</malay> you <malay>ingat tak yang kita pergi</malay> tasmania
(um)
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall
<malay>yang kita cari</malay> waterfall <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
[oh] [oh] ya ya ya
[oh] ya K [ah] at least <malay>bila kat dalam sana</malay>
<malay>dia sejuk sikit</malay> [oh]
<malay>cuaca dia orang memang sejuk</malay> so <malay>kita tak rasa sangat</malay> [ah]
[ah]
<malay>kalau nak pergi taman negara</malay> <malay>berpuluh lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>saya</malay> confirm
but it's hot [ah]
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have (err)
two thousand let me recall [ah] when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
(um) we went to travel around the areas [lah] so we went to spain (um)
specifically we went to madrid [lah]
(err) at that time two thousand eight <malay>tak salah tengah</malay> euro euro two thousand eight ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah] euro two thousand eight [lah]
so (err) I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
(mm) ya
ya <malay>kalau kalau</malay> travel as a student
(um) I think you really have to plan
how much you are going to spend so <malay>macam</malay> for us while <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> we either just took the
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
<malay>atau kita ambil</malay> (um) <malay>kita ambil apa</malay> the the budget flight [ah]
so I remember there was one (um)
so we were from netherlands <malay>kita</malay> travel to belgium via bus
so when we reach belgium
(um) we thought that the bus station (uh) at that belgium to the airport was quite near [lah]
only for us to realise that actually
<malay>kita dah terlepas</malay> the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
<malay>jauh</malay> I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium [lah] <malay>mana</malay> belgium is germany
so <malay>kita terlepas</malay> so <malay>konon-konon nak naik</malay> taxi [ah] the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks [ah] ya
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely [ah]
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
(um)
<malay>tak juga</malay> [ah] we were winging it [lah]
ya
[ah] ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>kita cakap dengan pakcik ni</malay> [ah] driver we need to get to this airport so <malay>dia kata</malay> that sixty kilometres away
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour [lah] but sixty kilometres away ya [kan] so it's still quite a distance
at least <malay>macam</malay>
forty five minutes to get there [ah]
so you <malay>macam dah</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] but the worst part is that we will we had no money [ah] there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
this was the start [lah] almost the start I think ya
no <malay>bukan takde duit</malay> [lah] but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means <malay>untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita</malay> hundred and this one [ah] more than hundred twenty euro <malay>habis kita dah duit dah sikit</malay> then <malay>kita macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
so we negotiated [lah] we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind [ah] he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind (err) I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros [lah] basically
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and <malay>nanti</malay> I will show you all
<malay>dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni lagi mahal</malay> [lah]
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation [kan]
ya [lah] I I think <malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam benda ini juga</malay> so <malay>dia</malay> on
<malay>dia</malay> on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter <malay>dah naik</malay> two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
and then by the time we reach there he
(uh) maybe three quarters [ah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he said
ya and then <malay>dia kata</malay> okay you look [ah] at the meter
<malay>sekarang dah</malay> hundred three hundred and twenty euro <malay>aku</malay> off K <malay>aku</malay> off
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got [lah] and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed [lah] maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey [ah]
<malay>lepak hidup</malay>
ya starting <malay>tu dah</malay> adventure [ah]
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight [lah] but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
no but I think <malay>kalau</malay> spain <malay>kalah</malay> confirm <malay>raih</malay> [ah]
[ah] but because spain won (err) I think I think through penalties [eh] spain <malay>menang</malay> italy and then [ah] because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the (um) there was a big screen <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) live telecast
so <malay>kita ramai-ramai</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana sama tengok</malay> live telecast [lah]
ya and (uh) I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid [lah] [ah] but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
(err) I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think [ah]
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
the trains <malay>tutup</malay> [sia]
[ah] so [dah] happy happy
<malay>jalan</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>jalan</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid [ah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid so madrid <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> portugal so <malay>kita pergi</malay>
so it was netherlands <malay>lepas tu ambil</malay> bus <malay>pergi</malay> belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal <malay>pergi</malay> (um) flight to madrid
ya that was that was an
all the way <malay>makan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>roti dengan</malay> tuna [ah]
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] everyday but basically living frugally [ah]
[oh] I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
<malay>kita</malay>
(um) my friend and I [lah] <malay>kita dah dah dah lapar</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita turun kat kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni kita kebetulan</malay> found a muslim shop which was nearby
no
you go through your hostel dot com <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah]
ya
so (um) <malay>jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>semua</malay> muslim brother <malay>dah masuk kedai dia</malay> apparently <malay>kita ternampak ada</malay> #prata# [ah]
#prata# [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so I don't know whether it was [ah] an instant #prata# or #prata# that they made [ah] <malay>tapi nampak macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so my friend and I [eh] <malay>baik</malay> [ah] this <malay>harapan</malay> #prata# <malay>puas hati</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tu kita dah tengah lapar</malay> so <malay>kita minta dia enam</malay> [ah] <malay>enam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tiga aku tiga</malay> [lah] <malay>enam</malay>
<malay>itu tak perasan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] and <malay>harga dia harga tak mahal sangat</malay> [lah]
true <malay>dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita dah</malay> okay [ah] <malay>enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar</malay> and he couldn't speak english
so
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu</malay>
then <malay>macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar</malay>
no
apparently <malay>dia orang makan</malay> order #prata# <malay>dengan macam sirap ke gula</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali manis nak mampus</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> I think they <malay>tuang</malay> the sugar on top [ah]
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each [ah]
so <malay>kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik</malay>
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ni dia ni kira macam</malay> muslim brother <malay>boleh pakai punya</malay> [ah]
ya
power [ah]
ya that's why
ya
ya
and then (uh) you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita <malay>keluar</malay> (um) maybe like after one or after the two
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four <malay>ke</malay> two to five [ah]
[ah] like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
so it's okay [lah] as in <malay>dia orang tutup sekejap</malay> for them to rest <malay>lepas tu dia orang buka sampai</malay> maybe <malay>sepuluh sebelas</malay>
ya
[ah] yup
true
[oh] (err) in madrid <malay>juga</malay> I where where when we were walking [ah] <malay>masih masih masih</malay>
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> there was this bangladeshi guy
who came up to us
say #assamualaikum# and started to (err) to talk to us in malay
<malay>kita dah kat</malay> madrid [eh] <malay>dia orang bual bual melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>muka</malay> bangladesh <malay>berbual melayu lepak</malay>
so we talk to him when quite further in he said [oh] actually yes he's bangladeshi
<malay>ada pernah kerja kat</malay> malaysia
for
working [ah] so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then (um) you know went back went to spain to work [lah]
I mean if the opportunity presents itself <malay>nak</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>kalau ada kerja yang bagus</malay> okay [ah]
ya working overseas is something
okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months [ah] of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close [ah] but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome [ah] to the point that I felt that !hey!
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both [ah]
okay so (um) when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
(um) the or the muslim students association they were quite
(um) vibrant and there are very active [lah]
so (um) I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them [lah]
because when I were went there also (um)
it coincided with the fasting month
[ah] <malay>lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana</malay> I mean
<malay>kalau kita kat</malay> singapore <malay>kalau bulan puasa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tarawih lepas tu</malay>
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short [ah]

okay [ah] first <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> regarding our hobby [lah] okay [ah] so you can first what is it your hobby
(um)
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>kalau</malay> for me my hobbies is [ah] I like to read books I like to travel I like to
[ah] mostly spend time <malay>dengan kawan-kawan ke apa</malay> [ah] that is my sort of hobbies that I like
[ah] I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really <malay>suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai</malay> I don't really like it
[ah] so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
(uh huh)
so other than
<malay>punya</malay> brand <malay>tak ada</malay> you don't have any other brand <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>suka ke apa ke</malay>
[kan] and I think you also <malay>suka</malay> Coach
you <malay>pun suka</malay>
[ah] quite lately [lah] I think that <malay>daripada dulu pun</malay> you <malay>memang suka</malay> Coach if not just lately
[ah] so <malay>apa lagi yang</malay> you
you <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>minat selain daripada</malay> bags
okay because for me [ah] whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore [kan] <malay>pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak</malay>
we <malay>apa</malay> more like
<malay>terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu</malay> [kan] so
when you
[ah] yes so is so now when you see for yourself [eh] actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
important the family <malay>makan</malay> and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like <malay>macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa</malay> it's edible [lah] <malay>boleh makan</malay> and there times <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>masak pada</malay> I is
(uh) fantastic [lah] it's good <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] I enjoy eating it which is something good [lah] [kan] hopefully
you can cook [ah] more things [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] the more the more rounder become most to most
[ah] exercise more [ah] exercise more in the imagination [lah] in reality I won't exercise
[ah] yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
[eh] this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya [lah] ten years ago still can play [lah] but now I think it'd be better
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore <malay>nak main bola dah susah</malay> I I try to ask my friends to play all
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play [ah] maybe
[ah] if I play football with
with #sharif# if the kid maybe can can be done <malay>ataupun</malay>
[ah] I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become [lah]
doubt so [lah] I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it [lah] don't want to waste my energy [ah]
during the malaysia cup [ah]
I think in terms <malay>kalau</malay>
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over [lah] first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
[ah] the whole society <malay>punya</malay> makeup <malay>pun dah</malay> changed I think now we are
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
[ah] whom is like
and the passion is just not there [lah] I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities [ah]
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> passion the thing is passion is there
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
<malay>budak-budak tak ada benda lain</malay>
<malay>budak-budak cuma</malay> only have
[ah] football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
to [ah] play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> when people play is
for the money for the fame [kan] then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
[ah] in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
[ah] I can just [ah] imagine myself to be #ronaldo# or #messi#
on the screen
[kan] if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if <malay>macam</malay>
now like <malay>dulu kalau kita nak tengok</malay> internet <malay>pakai</malay> computer will really stay in front of the computer
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers [kan]
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
<malay>tapi</malay> now even with handphone
you can basically
contact with the with the people
[kan] contact the people <malay>pun</malay>
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things [ah] (um)
(uh huh)
yes
ya so that is the different [lah] people change
[kan] so maybe certain things will be left behind [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] so the
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] the changes in in time [eh] so in order to survive
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time [lah] [kan] cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
[ah] mentality <malay>zaman dulu punya</malay> [kan] <malay>tak nak</malay> handphone <malay>tak nak pakai</malay>
[ah] internet [kan] I think <malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
[ah] impossible [ah] [kan] [ah]
okay (um)
yes
[ah] I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be <malay>apa terlalu ke belakang</malay> if let's say we are too far
[ah] behind [kan] then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
[ah] just nice for his [ah]
or his or her development
in the future [lah] even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
[ah] [ah]
yes correct
[ah]
(um)
[ah]
ya [lah]
have to have to try [lah] [kan] <malay>tu kadang-kadang</malay> when we try <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>susah juga nak nak</malay> catch up [kan] but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that [lah] [kan] okay <malay>sekarang nak</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal apa</malay> topic <malay>lain</malay>
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
[ah]
[ah] but in terms of travelling
<malay>kita takde</malay> [lah] travel <malay>banyak-banyak tempat</malay> [kan] [ah] so for our travel is mostly to
[ah] malaysia [kan]
[ah] [ah] maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia [ah]
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
[ah] (um)
[ah] if not we will be like <malay>apa</malay> every year at least [lah]
[ah] favourite place [ah] favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay [lah] our singapore dollar is strong [lah] then
I think <malay>bila kita pergi tu apa boleh</malay>
so hope <malay>macam apa</malay> we can
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe [kan]
so <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa</malay> [lah]
but it's a really complete
(uh) shopping [lah]
for the clothes only [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
what are the [ah] pattern what is the <malay>perangai yang kita boleh</malay>
[ah] click <malay>atau tak</malay> click what is our
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay [kan] but of course there is there different [lah] when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new [kan] but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is [ah] is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
(err) <malay>kalau bawa</malay>
our kid also will enjoy it more also [lah] [kan]
(uh) but
yes [ah]
[ah] ya [lah] you will set the goal when you go [ah]
[ah] [ah]
[ah] I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part [lah] [kan]
I mean
ya [lah] I think certain things you are more
[ah]
comfortable in handling and
[ah] certain things I am more comfortable in handling [lah] I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
[ah] planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
ya [lah] [ah] when authoritative-ness then
[ah] <malay>apa</malay>
people don't argue with you
[ah] yes [lah] you can <malay>ke depan</malay> [lah]
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
[ah] then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
[ah]
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay [lah]
[ah]
<malay>takda</malay> [lah] at least [kan]
we are realistic [lah] [kan] what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over [lah] I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small [lah] but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it [kan] so that is the difference
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya
I think for the #jakarta# [one]
when we reach
there we were like [eh]
first thing is the airport [lah]
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
(err) shopping centres (err) in the eighties [kan]
so okay [lah] that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
(uh)
[ah]
ya when we first <malay>sampai</malay> the hotel <malay>tu</malay>
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
[ah] something being kept for so long
it's not rotten [ah] it's like the carpet never wash for so long
[ah] [lah]
[kan] <malay>bila kita sampai</malay>
<malay>bilik tu macam</malay> okay everything go like so olden
[kan] [ah] [ah] so after <malay>lepas dah</malay> the <malay>bilik tu</malay> okay [lah] but overall
quite enjoyable [lah] in #jakarta# the
different way of life
[ah]
yes
yes our wedding
[ah] our wedding planner [ah]
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) [ah] yes
yes correct [ah] [ah]
(um) [ah]
[ah] the third
[ah]
hotel
basically is [ah] it's all paid for
the tour is [ah]
the tour is all planned [ah] so the driver the vehicle all all is provided
basically we are just supposed to
be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow [eh]
[ah]
testing [ah] [ah]
#tanah abang#
yes
[ah]
so sometimes [kan] you have to buy <malay>kadang-kadang macam apa</malay>
have to buy clothes same pattern but different colours [kan]
just for the sake of
[ah] getting (err)
cheaper cheaper price [ah] [kan]
because [ah] <malay>dorang tak jual</malay>
they don't sell by one piece one piece
they sell by [oh] you must buy at least three must buy at least four and
so that's why <malay>kadang bila kita</malay> when
we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore
(err)
<malay>dorang beli</malay> to sell at their shop <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
is money yes
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
ask for directions
<malay>nak pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>itu bukan itu aja</malay> even someone who
open the door for us
just holding the door still will be expecting us to
to <malay>kasi duit</malay>
then <malay>dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua</malay> [kan] [ah]
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] [kan] so other than that
[ah]
ya other than #jakarta# we went to [ah]

[ah] then one thing about #penang# ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
so <malay>macam kalau apa</malay> even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building <malay>tu di apa</malay>
they conserve so they make it part of the building [kan] which is [ah] a bit
a bit <malay>macam</malay> odd [lah] something good
but
[kan] <malay>kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia</malay>
conserve for the sake of [ah] conserving [ah] sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them [lah] cause they did conserve their [ah]

[ah] then other than that [ah] hopefully <malay>rezeki kita bertambah</malay> [lah]
[ah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) yes
family members [ah] [ah]
so other than that for me is (err) [ah]
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
[ah] maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated [lah] trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people <malay>pun</malay> move other parts of this [one] is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family <malay>pun</malay> move <malay>kalau kita punya</malay> situation [kan] and got a kid
to <malay>jaga</malay> [kan] to <malay>jaga</malay> we got a special needs <malay>adik</malay> to <malay>jaga</malay> [kan] so but okay [lah] I think it can be done [lah] it will be difficult sacrifice <malay>perlu dibuat</malay> [kan] <malay>cuma</malay> hope to <malay>apa</malay>
hope <malay>lagi banyak benda kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> will work out [lah] [kan]
the vision is clear [kan] [ah] our vision is clear [kan] of course <malay>kalau budak susah nak faham</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>tapi kata orang pun kita</malay> lead we lead [kan] most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay>
of course [lah] <malay>kadang ada orang</malay> selfish <malay>apa</malay> [kan] so if
that person selfish <malay>tak nak</malay> cooperate [kan]
I will go with the majority [lah] and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue [oh] then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
I will do it [lah] <malay>tapi kalau dah tak boleh</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku dah cakap kau tak nak dengar</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> get into <malay>masalah</malay>
<malay>kau suruh aku</malay> handle <malay>aku</malay> I feel <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] <malay>tak apa tak adil tak adil</malay> [kan] so I will always go for fairness
[ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
[eh] [lah]
<malay>leher</malay> [ah]
yes the neck <malay>tapi macam</malay> the neck only can show where to turn
[kan] <malay>tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang</malay> decide <malay>nak</malay> turn <malay>atau tidak</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya [kan] so <malay>sebab itu kita</malay> as a <malay>keluarga</malay> we are as a unit [kan] so we want to move we want to move as a unit
<malay>kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini</malay> [kan] then <malay>kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat</malay>
<malay>dia tak</malay>
affect <malay>tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah</malay> then
really have to <malay>apa</malay> explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue [lah] [kan] so the issue now is whether <malay>dapat</malay> settle <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> hopefully <malay>akan dapat</malay> settle [lah] [kan]
<malay>dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] I don't want to <malay>halang</malay>
<malay>kalau dia nak</malay> [kan] <malay>kita akan</malay> we are
[ah]
in terms of <malay>nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] yes
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>ubat</malay>
[ah] yes
[ah] cousin [ah]
<malay>tergantung</malay> it's very <malay>susah</malay> [lah] then
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best [lah]
I I submit document I submit application
<malay>semua dah buat</malay> [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
the thing is is like that
[kan] <malay>kata orang tu</malay> [kan]
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother [lah] [kan]
but now the organisation <malay>bukan satu tempat</malay>
they are two different organisations so <malay>yang ini tempat</malay> check
<malay>yang ini untuk</malay>
[ah] <malay>masa depan</malay>
for future <malay>yang ini untuk apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain</malay> so
have to go through a lot of places [lah]
whether it will improve <malay>ke tak</malay>
the future
<malay>tak juga dia</malay> different criteria [kan] like example <malay>kalau macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> in order to apply for example [ah] to apply for need
[ah] certification that he is autistic then <malay>dah pergi</malay> minds minds <malay>dah</malay> certify <malay>dia dah</malay> [ah] settle
then after that <malay>nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula</malay> [oh]
certification from (uh) minds <malay>tak cukup</malay>
you have to go through a certain
[ah] doctor [lah] doctor or hospital or what okay so <malay>pergi</malay> doctor <malay>punya</malay> hospital
happen doctor hospital <malay>tu pun</malay> [ah] okay [lah] willing to help okay he did that part
then after that <malay>bila nak</malay> apply for <malay>apa</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> cash in life for home caregiving [kan] [oh]
cannot we only we only accept those who are <malay>apa</malay>
authorised by us to do the [ah] assessment so go through check up again
so (um) (um)
[ah] [ah]
<malay>risiko</malay> there and the the thing is
okay [lah] <malay>macam cakap macam macam kita ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> for <malay>macam untuk adik ni</malay>
I am willing to <malay>usaha</malay> [kan] and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support [lah]
so <malay>kita kena buat</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi macam</malay> you try imagine
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] all these checks
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done [kan]
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then [ah]
yes correct and the thing is <malay>pula</malay>
<malay>kita pergi</malay> check up <malay>ni bukan</malay> free
everytime <malay>pergi</malay>
[ah] <malay>kena bayar ke apa</malay> [kan] but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds <malay>tolong</malay>
<malay>percuma</malay> free
[ah] even the hospital [one] happen epilepsy <malay>punya</malay> doctor [kan] so there is no extra charges [lah] and
[ah] so <malay>nanti</malay> Q cure <malay>ni kalau macam apa</malay>
in order <malay>dah dapat</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>apa ni semua</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>pula nak kena</malay> assessment [kan]
and then the assessment <malay>pun</malay> need another set of [ah] check up
[kan] [lah] so <malay>memang susah</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>duit apa</malay>
I think now is
[ah]
<malay>kita bukan harap</malay> [ah] [ah] at least <malay>dia</malay> improve
involved [ah] (uh huh)
<malay>istimewa</malay> [ah] (uh huh)
I think for him is my target for <malay>adik</malay> is <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] do the best that he can be [ah]
[kan] <malay>kita bukan</malay> I'm not expect <malay>bukan</malay> expect <malay>dia boleh</malay>
<malay>pandai</malay> [kan] <malay>macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat</malay>
enjoy enjoy what
he can enjoy [kan] of course <malay>dia punya</malay> enjoy not
<malay>macam kita macam kita</malay> enjoy [oh] <malay>kita nak jalan kita nak</malay> travel [kan] <malay>dia punya tak dia punya</malay> enjoy <malay>tu</malay>
simple something that <malay>dia suka</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> feel comfortable <malay>sudah</malay> [kan]
[ah] make try to make his life [ah]
meaningful [lah] that is what
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
ya [lah] <malay>tapi kata orang tu apa ye</malay> [lah] <malay>cuba kalau mana tahu kalau dia</malay> improve [kan]

!wow! mine is louder
K can
K ready
okay let's start
okay (uh) ya <malay>dia bukan</malay> friday <malay>sebab</malay> friday #shafie# <malay>dia kena</malay>
<malay>pergi sekolah</malay> so <malay>dia kata</malay>
(uh) <malay>kalau dia dah penat</malay>
<malay>dia tak</malay> enjoy so he wants
[ah] yes
<malay>dia tak ada</malay> [eh] <malay>ada</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> #shafie# <malay>nak</malay> involve
ya [lah] <malay>memang si</malay> june
<malay>tak payah</malay> mark <malay>sebab dia tak ada</malay>
ya [lah] we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya [lah]
ya so I think what we can do we don't go (uh) we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual [lah] we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in [ah]
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay [lah] (uh) we can take the the voucher [ah] you want to buy the voucher [ah] meaning we have to go (uh) the
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
(err)
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course [ah]
no [lah] the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before [what] just like the night safari
the four items [ah] the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
(err)
think eleven plus [ah]
[oh] (uh) wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge [ah] seven plus to nine
two you (uh) ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this [one] right
(uh) we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going [what] you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go [lah]
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also [lah] can
the three of them
but if #affaf# don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two [lah]
then it's two two each
Subway
[oh] over there got <malay>itu apa</malay> Marybrown
(mm) ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough [lah] don't know ya
have to
is the camera (uh) waterproof
don't have [ah]
can
#affaf# <malay>punya bukan dua lagi tu</malay>
<malay>si</malay> #affaf# <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] because her
her studies finish already [what] her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
(uh) the other two they don't need to go <malay>pun</malay>
knowing <malay>si apa</malay> knowing <malay>si</malay>
(err)
#affif# I think he doesn't want to go down
[eh] what
twentieth right
the following week [lah] after christmas
can [eh] no cannot
yes (uh) (uh)
cannot
<malay>dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
<malay>kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh</malay> if we go out I keep saying to the kids
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have [ah] not open yet [ah] okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups [lah] so the kids
all the children
add up (uh)
it's just nice
it's just nice eight eight person the children <malay>saja</malay>
force [lah]
monday
that's why first person to check is #aisyah#
I mean if you don't want to <malay>leceh</malay> then just do it at home [lah] <malay>kat rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
but if you I I don't know whether
(err)
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
one you contact <malay>kak</malay> #ogi#
then you ask her
then if she what he say [lah] you ask her for her opinion and all
then what what she say [lah] then after that <malay>baru</malay>
get the ball rolling
cause I think for us <malay>kita yang tak jumpa</malay> #aisyah# <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>si kecil tu</malay> at least <malay>kak</malay> #ogi# <malay>jumpa juga</malay> [lah] once and then <malay>ayah tu jumpa</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita langsung tak jumpa</malay>
since
<malay>bila raya</malay> [lah]
<malay>raya dia tunggu kita kita datang lambat kita ingatkan dia balik rupanya dia menunggu kita</malay>
think <malay>raya haji tak salah</malay>
[eh] <malay>buat juga</malay> [lah]
so my family side I can suggest
<malay>macam</malay> okay so it depends
(uh) ya [lah] there is a few suggestion [lah] one is
(uh) because <malay>sekarang ni yang paling ramai</malay> is either #mahir# or #amin#
[kan] <malay>kat rumah yang paling ramai</malay> so we either go to #mahir's# house or #amin's# house
<malay>kalau si</malay> #lina# <malay>dia</malay> happy <malay>kat rumah</malay> #amin# [ah] because it's more <malay>apa orang tu tak ada kucing</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> so <malay>ertinya</malay> we cannot come one time <malay>pun</malay> it's just <malay>macam contoh</malay> [lah] [eh]
(um) we split into two groups
so one group is maybe (uh)
<malay>kita dengan mak</malay>
so <malay>kita bawa mak dengan si</malay> #matin#
<malay>pergi rumah</malay> #amin# so <malay>kita lapan orang</malay> [lah] <malay>kita jumpa</malay> #amin# <malay>dengan budak-budak tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] then second group could be #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir#
<malay>bawa</malay> the children [ah]
[ah] [eh] [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir# <malay>dah tak boleh</malay> [eh]
ya
<malay>tak boleh</malay> eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why <malay>kalau nak jumpa kena macam</malay>
go to the one that is more [lah] [kan]
so <malay>contoh contoh</malay> [eh]
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there [lah]
so #affif# #affaf# #shafie# three
then (uh) maybe #mahir# send his kids but <malay>dah berapa</malay>
seven plus (uh) <malay>si kecil tu</malay> #akil# #akif#
<malay>dah lapan</malay>
<malay>anak</malay> #amin# <malay>kat rumah dia</malay> so already join in [lah]
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
[ah] #adoi# ya [lah] but if <malay>nak</malay> have a cousin gathering then can
and I think they don't mind [lah] because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya [lah]
but I think if it's like just cousins
get together before <malay>ini</malay> I think maybe okay [lah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let say it is (um)
so (uh) <malay>apa</malay> all the cousins meet one time
then okay <malay>balik</malay>
then
<malay>tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu</malay> okay <malay>kalau macam gitu</malay>
<malay>anak-anak saudara</malay> [jer]
you have how many (uh) eight plus four twelve
twelve children
so they can't sit together <malay>pun</malay> I mean they won't sit together <malay>pun</malay>
correct <malay>kalau dekat rumah</malay> #amin# <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang bermain</malay>
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
so to me <malay>biar anak-anak saudara ni semua</malay> all the children can come down at one time
then they
(mm) <malay>asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit</malay>
<malay>kita biar budak-budak semua pergi</malay> #amin# you handle the kids
<malay>kita</malay> (uh) adults alright bye bye <malay>kita</malay> go for our
K if it's a red line [ah] and it's too (um)
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
[ah]
#amin# I mean we all have been coming over
we [ah] #mahir# because the other time his family come over #amin# come over #amin# the whole family his whole family come over
so and then #andir# <malay>selalu</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay>
so it's not like <malay>ini</malay> [lah] it's the together <malay>ramai-ramai yang tak ada</malay>
okay do how [ah]
(uh)
ya [lah] (uh) we can give suggestions and then let them think
so one of my suggestion is that [lah] (uh) let the kids all <malay>kumpul kat rumah si</malay> #amin# so at least the kids
<malay>cari penyakit tu namanya</malay>
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest #amin# would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
(uh) at one time at one go
and then (err)
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay [lah] then after that
of course [lah]
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
[ah] apply
once you step out the house <malay>tak boleh</malay>
okay other than that then they all meet at <malay>tu</malay> their <malay>ayah teh</malay> house
<malay>ayah teh</malay> will be very happy all come come come
just that maybe #amin# (uh) only
the two older [eh] #umar# also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if #umar# is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
<malay>abang</malay> is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
K so
(mm)
right okay so what else [ah] do you want to talk about (um)
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya [lah]
very difficult
ya cannot [one]
the night safari
how and what else can we do with <malay>mama</malay>
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
then we <malay>ajak mak</malay>
twenty
that weekend [ah] the christmas weekend twenty six <malay>ke</malay> twenty seven
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
so if let's say you want to <malay>pergi pun boleh pakai</malay> wheelchair <malay>kat situ</malay>
or jewel
jewel [kan] <malay>dia ada</malay> all those (uh) tours right
<malay>pergi jalan</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> waterfall [lah]
the the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>atas tu ada</malay> the the <malay>apa</malay>
the
ya
we we also haven't gone [what] we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options [lah] so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ada cakap apa semalam</malay> wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
<malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> own timing
not today is tomorrow <malay>kakak dia ajak</malay> tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want <malay>memang</malay> he already say he (uh) a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
no
so okay [lah] at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that [one]
no the problem is
all others in singapore [lah] unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to [what]
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
ya that's why that's why I say so <malay>lepas ni</malay> she have to go to <malay>apa ni</malay>
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
because I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay>
(um) the problem with all other (uh) uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's (uh) and her lecturer one whom she took the last course [kan]
that lecturer <malay>yang</malay> quite good [lah] she talk to him quite a bit
then she the lecturer actually say (um)
that
if you he teach at these two uni <malay>dua-dua</malay> uni <malay>dia ajar</malay>
murdoch [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> northumbria so <malay>dia ajar</malay>
a topic module not on in these two uni [lah]
so <malay>dia kata memang kat</malay> northumbria
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
whereas <malay>dekat</malay> murdoch
you <malay>dah buat</malay> all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
(err) coursework [lah] another <malay>apa</malay> testing test
you have to write [ah] [ah] correct
so she's (uh) worried about the that part [lah] that's why
no she already <malay>memang</malay> in this line
<malay>dia dah memang buat</malay> communication so she can
(uh huh) ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya [lah]
they actually have it [leh] the last time she say they the
officers came into the class and <malay>dah</malay> explain <malay>pun</malay> everything <malay>tapi</malay> (uh)
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
even that <malay>wira</malay> guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go [lah]
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants [ah]
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
(err)
(mm) more working people are opting for that course more working people [tau] meaning people who are
let's say they (uh) they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us [lah] she (uh) or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student [ah] so she will be like considered as an adult already [lah]
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say (uh)
(err) income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
[ah] but actually that [one] not much [lah]
of course [lah] because she is [ah]
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
(uh) adult already <malay>cuma</malay> I don't know in terms of
(uh)
ya [lah]
like that [lah]
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have (uh) all these other
unis [ah] which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
[oh] my god that's why I was
ya [lah] because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
and then now they tell us <malay>dah tak ada</malay> (uh) two time
it's very frustrating [lah]
ya so that [one] actually I thought (uh) I want to sit down with her and go through all the
all [ah] all of the <malay>ni</malay> ya
ya [lah]
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
ya [lah] so for example the other time <malay>dia pergi</malay> M
<malay>tu</malay> actually not bad and I saw the programme <malay>pun macam bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>dia ada</malay> sound recording space
all those things [lah] so and she went in they were all telling her [oh] you know (uh) this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like #affaf# are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop (uh)
K so
we need another
ya we need another (uh)
round of her checking [lah] ya for her to check
<malay>mana kawan dia</malay> <malay>atau</malay> overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up [lah] and say okay go maybe australia <malay>ke mana</malay>
practise <malay>apa maksudnya</malay>
that's why okay another option is <malay>tengok dekat</malay> malaysia
because malaysia <malay>pun banyak</malay> twinning programme
and twinning programme <malay>dia pun</malay> not bad quite good
<malay>anak ustaz</malay> [ah]
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
[ah] so actually we just limit it to singapore <malay>cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil</malay> kaplan
so with that diploma <malay>kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain</malay>
one more year <malay>tapi</malay> it's just one more year ya [lah]
ya [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dia</malay> at the end of the day <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak ni nak buat</malay> #shafie# <malay>mati-mati nak buat</malay> photography right he wants to be a photographer
that's what he wants to do
so
ya [lah] she
[lah]
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based [lah] so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics [lah] right that's physics right
so more about physics
[ah] so you learn how to make
the (uh) you learn what is the because
#shafie# <malay>dia</malay> once he is focused on
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
so that part is good [lah] he <malay>kalau betul-betul</malay> interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya [lah] you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
(um)
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application (uh) by this person
who wants to (uh) (uh) okay because I put up (uh) a post
[ah] resale
ya okay so two [ah] one is about the
(um) recruitment
(uh) I put
teacher coach (uh) at SAM [lah]
so so far
(uh)
two person submit one is a malay girl who
<malay>bukan yang dia</malay> she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like !huh! <malay>apa kejadah ni</malay> so she apply K
the other one is an indian lady
(uh) <malay>anak tiga ke apa tak tahu</malay> she is she used to teach in preschool
used to teach english
so she (uh) she apply but we are maths [kan] so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
[ah] that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because (uh) we already signed up [what] it's for free at that point in time [lah]
(uh) when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say (uh) this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
(uh) about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
[ah]
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can <malay>macam</malay>
switch her [lah]
ya
ya [lah] paying the teacher only
correct [lah]
ya [lah] I mean that is not the whole idea <malay>pun</malay> the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so <malay>kalau</malay> let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources <malay>pun</malay>
so okay [lah] so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
(um) a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
you you go and pause <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] my god
<malay>putus</malay>
no [lah] <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tekan</malay> the other side [oh] my god [oh] my god okay
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
[oh] he he message he say <malay>kak</malay> I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run [ah] let it run [ah]
but if if if cannot get the numbers <malay>itu yang ini</malay> [kan]
so the partnership confirm don't want [ah] so I will message to say don't want [ah]
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya [lah] the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
session <malay>tu yang</malay> I told #ira# #ira# <malay>kalau</malay> let's say parents <malay>datang</malay> they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session [ah] I <malay>cakap</malay>
because you can still do the assessment on the first day <malay>dia datang tu</malay> you can do
[ah]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say <malay>dia</malay>
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
so <malay>dia</malay> accept <malay>dia</malay> P three still have to give the
the worksheets for P three right [ah]
if ya so on the first day <malay>dia datang</malay>
<malay>dia buat</malay> the assessment <malay>dulu</malay> that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue [lah] from there [kan]
so #ira# <malay>angguk-angguk</malay> don't whether she <malay>faham ke</malay> she agree <malay>ke</malay> will do <malay>ke tak tahu</malay>
okay so
progress report I told #ira# to do that already
I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> print the progress report do the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
so that tomorrow we print out <malay>semua</malay> all one time [lah] so that's why I want to know what is it
that's what you said to #ira# right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of #ira# you said to #ira# directly
I was there so I think it's okay [lah] let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out [lah]
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
I don't know [eh] to me <malay>macam</malay> it's okay [lah] you just print out <malay>pun</malay> okay black and white <malay>apa</malay>
can't be bothered to
don't have to <malay>turun</malay> you have to pass to the children
and then we message the parents we have passed the
(uh) final <malay>apa</malay> the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
<malay>kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi</malay> on in june
july right we're supposed to give (uh) first week july then we didn't give
so this [one] at least we give [lah] everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya [lor]
but then
buy over then he buy over [lah]
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
(uh) for (uh) the person who takes over is a full time
owner
[tau] so he was saying
(uh) Kumon <malay>pun cakap</malay> the same thing
so he the new centre <malay>yang dia nak</malay> run (uh) a franchise <malay>tu</malay>
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved [lah]
(uh) in
ya sort of like that [lah] ya correct
but I was thinking actually no [lah] (uh) #yang# was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut [lah] so I think he can
ya [lah] he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said [lah] a bit
you know I said (uh) (uh) in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot [ah] then I say during and all ya ya ya
(uh) I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only [ah] I can understand a bit but
(uh) chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say [oh] because
(uh) nearby our place (uh) it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so (uh) a lot of (uh)
(uh)
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
[ah]
then then (uh) because of that
(um) we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
[oh] okay okay but now got Google translate [what]
can just (uh) tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear [lah]
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say [oh] but the children can speak english [what] so the children can explain I say yes
(um) we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had (uh) chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy [lah]
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just [oh] okay
[ah] [ah]
[ah] that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct [lah] ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
okay so he has been teaching when he was in (um) school <malay>dulu dia mengajar</malay>
(uh) part time part time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) he take up one or two (uh) students that kind of thing
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be (uh) with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
[ah] banking <malay>dia</malay> banking so he was already working in
(uh) (uh) he's a graduate
[ah]
so he was working
(uh) but it was only for a few months and then COVID
so <malay>kena</malay> lay-off
last to come it first to go
okay <malay>dia dia</malay>
but he has always been doing tuition <malay>macam</malay> his part time [lah] and all
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
<malay>orang</malay> #serani# so he he used that word you know he say <malay>saya orang</malay> #serani# he say like that I was like [ah]
[oh] okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe [lah]
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can <malay>macam</malay>
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like [oh] okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better (uh) candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
[ah] so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
(err) do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well (uh) and and starts in his course [lah] so he was saying
he understand children (uh) who have difficulty in maths [lah] he can he can relate so he knows (uh)

our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay [lah] but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
(err) the jokes are more for singapore centric [lah] not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that [eh] maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
[ah] but they don't have that that that talent because #suhaimi# also can speak a bit of <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and then they no [lah] they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya [lah] but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months [what]
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it

the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again [ah] where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again

but now COVID don't have already [lah]
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already [lah]
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no [lah] most of them are retired already
the malay teacher [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay>
<malay>cikgu ahmad suki</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
[ah] so <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
I think somebody which
I think later I show you I think I have a picture no no not really <malay>botak botak</malay>
he's a bit a bit bald
but now as age catch up you don't really recognize him until somebody pointed out then [eh] isn't that (err) <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay> then [eh]
[eh] ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression [lah] I mean
they they have to retire [what] once they they hit their sixties
have the energy [lah]
professorship
ya [lah] I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
<malay>sayang</malay> we are the millennials <malay>sayang</malay>
yes
<malay>sayang</malay> millennials starts
yes I'm millennial [ah]
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch [lah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
even my brother is millennial
my brother #naz#
so #naz# is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation [lah]
no she she got (uh) she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot [lah] but
but if she can if she can you know (err) ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya [lah] but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation [lah] I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made (err)
make a profit [lah] but the thing is if she
ya [lah] about one point one million [lah] but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
(mm)
how much she bought it
but her one is at #simei# right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand (uh)
thirteen years ago
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand [lah]
!huh!
so just just
(uh) amber road
[ah]
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal [lah] because (err)
[oh] so new [lah]
well that's a risk
development
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah]
but her place second floor
what one point
[oh]
her main bedroom
[oh] cause so it's quite big [lah]
ya okay but
(uh huh)
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
#dasha# when she can save more money right
(mmhmm)
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person [what]
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more [what] if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored [lah] then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means (err) in the embassy one is paying for her living space [eh] if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I mean [kan] <malay>ini duit</malay> I mean <malay>kalau</malay>
I mean now okay [lah] maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya [lah] but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury (uh) apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense [what]
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people [lah]
say about thousand plus [ah] ya maybe [ah]
okay
if six person ya [lah] if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya [lah] make sense [lah]
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy [lah] one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy (err) is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya [lah] I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo [lah] so that
they are being sheltered [lah]
fixed condo
[ah]
[ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they (uh) being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but (err) when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference [ah] cause
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes (err) what drives what drives people
(mm)
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
(err) flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
(mmhmm)
how much
ya that's quite a lot
[oh] [eh] so he's the degree [lah]
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh huh)
#eton# what's a #eton#
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore [lah]
[oh]
depend on the area [lah] depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese [leh]
the vietnamese might like my friend the <malay>tuan</malay> the guy
he's (err) he knows (err) he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese (err) they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area [lah] maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence [ah]
(mm)
!huh! russia
I know a few I know a few malaysian but they they study in scotland [ah] <malay>yang irfan punya kawan</malay> scotland scotland
but is it recognized or not in singapore
(uh huh)
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
the recognition you know like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] malaysian malaysia hospital [lah]
[oh] okay and then then okay [lah]
because if not wasted [kan] <malay>kalau tak</malay> recognize and then after all the effort
[ah]
[oh] why [ah]
wasted [kan]
medicine also medicine [what]
[oh]
[oh] okay
[eh] [oh] (err) #rundy# #rundy#
#rundy# #rundy#
(uh) ireland or scotland [ah]
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand [ah]
four hundred thousand
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya most I suggest
most of them they they love like all my army friends army friends (uh) <malay>nama dia</malay> #kartik#
#kartik# <malay>dia</malay> just I just saw from facebook he
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait [ah] can remain thirteen fourteen
after fourteen years <malay>dah bukan jadi</malay> principal
most of my friends
in singapore
(mm)
I think the highest I heard is [jer] [lah]
so not not easy
but in in in
<malay>macam</malay> australian <malay>ni semua</malay> I think it's I wouldn't say it's it's easier
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback [ah]
(uh)
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge [ah]
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh)
I think ya [lah] because the the guys are not
are not <malay>madrasah</malay> train so they have more
no no the the
#adi# is secular #adi# is <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that he went to secular but for no #ahmad# is (err) all the way is
(err) secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
so <malay>macam</malay> like for
for the girls they
they're they're
[ah] because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which [ah] no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences [ah]
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option

okay nice
thank you bye bye

my side recording
five four three two one
okay <malay>baik</malay> okay let's start the things <malay>macam</malay> how's things on your weekend
ya I mean <malay>tadi</malay> ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid <malay>dia tidur</malay> all the way so my wife <malay>ingatkan dia</malay> can go to the hairdresser and then just relax <malay>kejap</malay> [lah]
you know just have a relaxing hair trim (err) hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that (err) because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before <malay>balik kerja</malay> [eh] <malay>jadi dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> one whole day just pamper <malay>sendiri saja</malay> [lah] so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this [ah] just nice also you (err) you also <malay>jadi</malay> to do all these things ya so K [lor] so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
(err) while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament <malay>punya benda</malay>
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these [leh] I don't think this (err) all the researchers I think it's okay [lah] to all these to talk about all these things [ah] I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
[a'ah]
exactly ya ya that's my idea <malay>pun</malay> I was also thinking about that actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya so ya I also (err) not been discussing my guys (err) all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with [lah] (err) those that were in the <malay>semua tu</malay>
so <malay>dia orang kata</malay> you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when <malay>kita takde benda</malay> you know like you you there's no real cove [lah]
like everybody knows <malay>kita punya</malay> reputation <malay>tapi takde takde</malay> portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event <malay>dulu</malay>
the weekly event and then just nice (err) earlier this week <malay>ada</malay> there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so <malay>dia punya</malay> format [eh] sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee <malay>jadi</malay> first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so <malay>kalau kalau</malay> all sixty four players <malay>masuk dalam</malay>
#prizenya# <malay>tak banyak</malay> it is seriously <malay>tak banyak</malay> actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person <malay>jadi</malay> the whole prize pool [eh] <malay>baru apa enam ratus</malay> six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get <malay>tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus</malay> dollar <malay>pun tak sampai</malay> it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league <malay>jadi kena main</malay> each other for like
(uh) (uh) god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks (err) assuming one game a week [lah]
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches <malay>jadi</malay> a a lot of the the response of the company <malay>semua tak nak main</malay> it's like [eh] it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars <malay>tapi</malay> you know like it's <malay>nak</malay> you you enter that
only top three <malay>dapat menang apa-apa</malay> and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even <malay>dua ratus</malay> so <malay>banyak orang</malay> you know the <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay> [lah] all this thing [ah] so I was wondering but
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
maybe let's say like of the registration fees [kan] ninety percent these guys only did like not even half [ah] what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent <malay>tak sampai setengah</malay> of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day <malay>saja</malay> and then (err) we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves (err) ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so (err) what's that called
(um) so serious because we are our own clients <malay>apa</malay>
so you know there's <malay>kita</malay> we can just like <malay>borak</malay> have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them [ah] look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars [ah] because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time <malay>saja</malay> [lah] so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per [ah] for the whole tournament [kan] then we take just ten percent that's (uh) between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour [lah] outside [lah] now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out [lah] but whatever it is at least [eh] the whole tournament (um) one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
I I I <malay>entah</malay> [eh] I also don't know how many people have resgistered <malay>tapi</malay> the the response I get <malay>banyak orang semua semua kutuk</malay> [ah] critics <malay>semua kutuk</malay> top top white center
now <malay>semua kata</malay> you know <malay>ni apa apa benda</malay> what kind of nonsense is this you know <malay>buat apa kita main buat apa</malay> I mean we play so much <malay>habis duit sikit saja</malay> then <malay>kena main lama lama</malay> how many weeks ya [lah] <malay>ada</malay> better things to do [ah] than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no <malay>tak tak tak nampak lain</malay> [ah] <malay>ada apa</malay> [eh] let me see <malay>kalau ada</malay> league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
(uh) I drop it in discord
ya so
<malay>namanya</malay> D to sports league <malay>entah siapa</malay> I <malay>langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada</malay> nine hundred plus members <malay>kat dalam</malay>
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
let's see <malay>ada tak berapa berapa orang dah</malay> sign up <malay>tak ni tak nampak pula</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi nampak macam masih buka</malay> [jer] <malay>masih boleh</malay> sign up [jer]
(um) I just didn't know
[a'ah] <malay>berapa orang</malay>
[ah] <malay>belum tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>berapa orang</malay> [ah] <malay>kat dalam</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this (err) whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so <malay>semua orang kata</malay> like
you know the this league not worth it seriously
so there wasn't even any one they say !alah! just go for the fun of <malay>biar</malay> [jer] <malay>langsung takde orang</malay> say that <malay>semua semua kutuk</malay> okay I'll I when I say <malay>semua</malay> [eh] it's literally there only like three people that response [ah] that responded
<malay>yang lain semua</malay> you know <malay>buat buat tak kisah saja</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
en
(mm)
ya
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>buat ni benda</malay> just (err) make a few posters <malay>bilang semua</malay> okay [eh] <malay>aku ada</malay> league [ah] you know you get thirty percent <malay>kalau kamu menang</malay> you get thirty percent
<malay>tapi</malay> fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything <malay>benda senang</malay> I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
<malay>macam</malay> gray <malay>macam makan makan makan sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>makan</malay> all the community
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah] exactly exactly ya
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point [lah] is that social media aspect [lah] so
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event <malay>semua</malay> [kan] minimum or I think we can do a (uh) forty a thirty forty players so <malay>takde</malay> issue <malay>langsung</malay> [ah]
but (um) the social media aspect of a one off thing [eh]
<malay>itu pun susah juga</malay> [kan] so I'm so I'm thinking at least <malay>kalau kita</malay> have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just (err) <malay>macam mana kata</malay> [eh]
(err)
every week <malay>ada</malay> content <malay>baru</malay> that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
[ah] ya
ya
[ah]
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and [ah] we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio [eh] how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm) maybe maybe who knows maybe
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
I
actually <malay>nak kata</malay> possible [eh]
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once [ah] actually <malay>nak kata</malay> registration fee <malay>selalunya berapa</malay>
<malay>sepuluh lima</malay>
<malay>selalunya</malay>
[ah] okay all the tournaments then
because they're by community centre budget no problem <malay>untuk dia punya wang</malay> actually it's free registration <malay>dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa</malay>
so it's just my <malay>masuk</malay> [lah] [kan] but that's for the <malay>punya</malay> [lah] (um) ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play <malay>juga</malay> then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> for all the events (um) what [ah] who [ah] they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>bayar bayar bayar</malay> [jer] so <malay>takde</malay> registration fee <malay>takpe juga untuk dia orang</malay> ya but for us we add in [lah] as much as we want to we are we are okay with
(uh) how do I say [ah] ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think !alamak! one day registration fee <malay>sepuluh ketul</malay> and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
you know so
ya so
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way (err) let's say registration fee let's say <malay>lima ketul</malay> [lah] I I can definitely okay
(err) five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know (err) so (err) or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that [ah] we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool [eh] wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off [tau] this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
(mm)
(mm)
ya correct
(uh huh)
<malay>betul</malay>
ya okay
(uh huh)
ya
(mm)
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say [eh] we do everything for every
let's say every saturday [lah] [eh] every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get (err) thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have (um) four four prize winners
each of the prize winners (err) okay and then at least (err) total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright (um)
or we could just put it every every week (err) the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number [lah] K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
the more people that join your prize <malay>pun naik gila babi</malay>
okay [a'ah] and then like this [ah] we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool [lah] basically [lah] alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say [eh] thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
(uh) one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match <malay>kau dah menang tiga</malay> dollar
ya
[ah] <malay>duit datang balik</malay> [tau] all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that [lah] so let me get up my word pad my notepad [ah] so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
[oh] six eight
[dah] eighty percent [eh] [a'ah] [sia] <malay>tu dah banyak juga tu</malay>
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually [ah] we can't do that maybe top eight [ah] top eight get five percent [lah]
yes
[ah]
ya get a wise five (uh) [eh]
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
soon <malay>lepas tu kalau dapat masuk</malay> to the semi final top four [ah]
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
(err) so five percent each <malay>lima peratus satu orang lima peratus</malay> okay <malay>naik</malay> top four
[ah] <malay>kau dapat sepuluh</malay> percent [lah] <malay>sepuluh peratus</malay> [ah]
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent [ah]
correct so you <malay>masuk kalau</malay> you <malay>masuk</malay> quarter final <malay>sudah dapat</malay> five percent you <malay>masuk</malay> semi final you get ten percent
you <malay>masuk</malay> final up to fifteen percent
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
(err) <malay>mana</malay> percent <malay>yang</malay>
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great [lah] okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh] so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four [eh] the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright <malay>naik</malay> four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool [dah] removed
K
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(um)
ya
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent <malay>pun boleh</malay> thirty percent of the total prize pool
[eh] of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is [lah] whatever amount
there will really get people to like [eh] !siala! if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at [eh] I only pay five dollar registration fee [tau] I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
[a'ah] correct
matchmaking <malay>pun susah</malay> [ah] [ah] ya so so that's the thing [ah] then the list (uh) ya uneven
so that's it we need to have at least
(um)
ya [eh] <malay>kalau tak</malay> some people get a buy then they get their money back [eh] that's not fair <malay>juga</malay> [eh]
(um)
okay but that's why okay you (um) then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
(mm) (mm)
(mm) true also true also difficult [ah]
(mm)
thirty two fairly I think [eh] no problem <malay>senang</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [ah] <malay>senang</malay>
sixty four possible
<malay>tapi aku tak boleh ganti</malay>
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
en
(mm)
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing [kan] I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off (um) so that hopefully we can get our own (uh) third party sponsors [ah] <malay>takde orang akan kacau kita</malay> [lah]
so this idea [eh] is basically if I were to go to N
falls the one that is working with SCOGA [ah] cause <malay>dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat</malay> community events <malay>sendiri juga</malay>
en
my understanding is that he has his own production <malay>punya</malay> house or something like that
(err) but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that [kan] we telling him that [eh] looked operations side <malay>kita semua dah</malay> settled everything <malay>kita dah dah fikir masak-masak</malay> and <malay>kita boleh</malay> you know <malay>bawa orang-orang</malay> confirm register <malay>punya</malay>
you know <malay>tapi</malay> the one problem [kan] that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA <malay>duit</malay> no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more (err) jet ideas
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them [kan] they're all out for it
that is what N #nadesan# has been saying [ah] <malay>kalau duit</malay> anything with money <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford <malay>kita</malay>
his words [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> so that's that's the thing [ah] we will be working you know like (uh) together with SCOGA it won't be our event [eh] technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
let me
[ah]
let me try and see if I can find (err)
(err) what's that called [lah]
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
<malay>semua</malay> ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway [lah] actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like [ah] people association <malay>entah apa</malay> community club [lah] sports club
south west <malay>ni semua</malay> so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this (err) <malay>apa dia</malay> E delta league
(err) basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
I don't know <malay>macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up [oh] okay so it's gonna be an offline event [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> venue partner [dah] sports up <malay>tapi</malay> it's (um) [ah] you know like (um) it's again [ah]
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations [ah]
so basically SCOGA [eh] in my opinion how they've been running all their events [kan] sama macam</malay> zenway <malay>sama</malay>
it's a it's a carbon copy
<malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>buat</malay> the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then (err) this (err) will have (err) the our
our venture <malay>punya</malay> logo whatever it is [lah] [eh] we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that (uh) ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
what I'm afraid of [eh] is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife [ah] technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event <malay>dia tak suka</malay> the idea of <malay>kita</malay> (um) how to say [ah] handing over the rains to another person
<malay>dia nak kita</malay> hundred percent <malay>seratus peratus ni</malay> event <malay>kita bukan orang lain punya</malay> this is ours have our name over there for and then of this (uh)
you know <malay>orang lain tak boleh kacau</malay> [ah] <malay>senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau</malay>
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about [lah] like
(err) like (um) even when I I told her the idea look [ah] why not (err) we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these [tau] she want us to be on our own
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner <malay>kita</malay> sure but it's not <malay>kita</malay> joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event [tau]
then they'll be like <malay>mana nama kau aku nampak nama</malay> SCOGA [jer] <malay>nama kau mana</malay>
I said [oh] now we work under SCOGA <malay>mana bukti</malay>
<malay>kita tak tahu</malay> SCOGA <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if <malay>kalau kita boleh tunjuk</malay> on a poster that has our logo on it
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african [lah]
<malay>dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa</malay> [ah] they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what [ah] (err) we are not not just mere partners or whatever <malay>kita tak buat apa-apa</malay> but
<malay>kita yang</malay> run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with [ah] whoever but they have to be partners it's not <malay>kita</malay> join <malay>dia orang</malay> we work under their name
that's the number one thing [ah]
yes
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor [lah]
a
[ah]
<malay>satu orang kena</malay> start <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] <malay>senang kata</malay>
[ah]
<malay>tu tu yang</malay> <malay>juga</malay> [eh] that
and then why I also <malay>tak nak</malay> like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> there there would seem a little bit of a chip [ah] then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor <malay>kata</malay> okay so <malay>siapa yang</malay> sponsor your previous event (uh) and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I <malay>tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>ini kau punya</malay> company <malay>apa</malay>
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible (um) you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all [lah] you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
(err) potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
(um)
ya ya correct
a
[ah] [ha] [ha] [ha] <malay>tu yang</malay> problem <malay>juga</malay>
(uh huh)
a
but I think I would okay <malay>nak kata</malay> our community [eh] okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like (um)
you will have your own you know shout out [lah] you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising [ah] a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events [eh] is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they (err) how to say that the
I <malay>macam mana nak kata</malay> (uh) <malay>ada orang kata</malay> a lot of times at people sponsor <malay>benda</malay> [kan] they don't actually get anything much out of it
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer [lah] in a way [lah]
it's the same as advertisement [ah] so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
(mm) but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head [eh] I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
junior <malay>apa</malay> junior what
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay (err) so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us [lah] okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
(mm)
yup (mm) (mm) (mm)
so
[ha] [ha]
[a'ah] [sia]
!alamak!
!alamak!
okay
okay
I think ya I think in the end <malay>tu nak buat</malay> sponsor tag [ah] in the end
ya
you know <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
okay
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now <malay>dekat</malay> facebook [eh] all the videos [kan] it will show how many views <malay>ada ada ada</malay> rather it will show how many views actually
[ah] what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>itu semua tak ada</malay> (um) ya even okay right now zenway is live right now <malay>sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok</malay> some mobile legends <malay>punya benda</malay>
ya but I don't see any total views <malay>belum lagi belum lagi</malay> total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show <malay>berapa</malay> [eh] let me see another video
(um)
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the problem my my midnight <malay>punya</malay> shows [ah]
there's another
[ah] correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports [lah]
one play E sports
one play sports videos the problem with <malay>semua malam-malam betul</malay> [ah] <malay>paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang</malay> #problemnya#
<malay>ada ada orang</malay> but it's not that much [ah] okay ya I'm looking here
(mm) asia champions league <malay>semalam</malay> nine hundred views (err) asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
pure (err) pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
(mm)
ya the singapore premier league a week ago (err) three point eight K views
one hour <malay>juga ni semua</malay> one our cast
(mm)
but that was the the very first <malay>punya</malay> [lah] I mean like it was the first
(err) what's that called
okay E #singa# cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
(err) E #singa# cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs [ah]
<malay>ramai juga</malay>
for the one V one E #singa# cup
one V one E #singa# cup
[oh] they split it into
the whole league
(err) but they split it into different parts [ah] <malay>macam</malay> part one first two hours ten ten K views
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands [ah] early thousands
you know so ya
quite quite a bit this four [lah] but then again [eh] E sports <malay>ada berapa berapa</malay> followers <malay>ni</malay> E sports how many followers
[oh] shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
[ah]
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel (err) you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
#aiman# will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask <malay>iman pun</malay> can we stream it on your stream
ya that would that would really help
because [eh] if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just (err) #aiman# giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then (err) what's that called [ah] ya and then like this [ah] people will be alerted
or even better if we can get we can rope #aiman# in as a commentator <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
ya
exactly
[ah] correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because [ah] I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that [lah] like how [sia] <malay>macam mana aku nak</malay> you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
[ah]
<malay>jadi kalau kalau</malay> if there's a way [eh] for us to go meet #aiman# I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think <malay>kalau kita bilang dia</malay> look <malay>kita ini kita semua</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> will <malay>ini kita punya</malay> event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money [ah] so maybe <malay>kalau dia dengar tu</malay> [eh] the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now <malay>dia ada banyak banyak</malay> event [kan]
<malay>jadi kalau kalau</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>dia banyak</malay> events [ah] so I don't know what he was bitching to us about [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> honestly I was like dude <malay>ini</malay> it like it [ah] I look I know you're disappointed E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia of fucking meeting [ah] (err) bullshit I just said [ah] sorry
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity [ah] you're winning quantity wise those two guys [eh] other than E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia <malay>apa lain dengan</malay> other <malay>dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay>
<malay>tak tak takde benda</malay> [sia] I can't I [ah]
okay I know that (err) see <malay>siapa ni</malay> matthew [eh] has (uh) has (uh) some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing <malay>dari bola</malay> [tau] so you know [ah] [oh] <malay>kalau nak kata</malay> streaming <malay>bola</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia orang takde benda</malay> [sia] decipher <malay>lagi takde benda</malay> at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher <malay>langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa</malay> [tau]
so ya so he said [oh] I lost out to them honestly [ah] it's just connections [ah] you lost [tau] on connections [ah] that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
a
ya
(um)
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
because I know he's been doing singapore events <malay>juga</malay>
you know and all we want [eh] it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our #chapalang# event <malay>tak ada</malay> sponsor <malay>takde apa takde benda</malay>
us <malay>sepuluh ribu</malay> views [tau]
or whatever we can (uh) we can get [lah] we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
[ah] ya so
(mm)
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who #sekaiichi# is [ah] they just look at pure viewership numbers [ah] we can talk about them [eh] we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
you know (err) ya I also can tell it you know [ah] definitely when I when I let know of my community (err) this this affinity whatsapp group <malay>semua</malay> that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
[ah]
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because (um) and you know really likes to work together with me [lah] basically [lah]
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA [lah] so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block <malay>kita ada</malay> [ah] <malay>aku aku pun tak tak takde</malay> ideas [ah] <malay>apa nak buat</malay> like to find my own third party sponsor <malay>semua takde</malay> idea <malay>langsung</malay> [ah]
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or (err) what [ah] <malay>macam macam kau dan aku yang yang</malay> my friend #hafiz# the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that [kan]
<malay>dia kerja</malay>
I broached either to him by [eh] <malay>nak</malay> sponsor <malay>kita tak</malay> you know this sort of event then <malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> managed to get them in [eh] <malay>aku bagi kau</malay> you know some some credit or whatever [lah] some kickback [lah] so <malay>dia kata</malay>
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage <malay>dia orang tak langsung tak</malay> support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
okay so
officially [eh] looking at their website [eh] <malay>dia kata</malay> [ah] they are a youth non profit organisation
<malay>kalau nak</malay> under official words [ah]
(um) ya they have (err) few initiatives [lah] all this (err) E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya (err) and they let see <malay>apa lagi dia orang ada</malay> [eh] about us
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
(uh) ya so <malay>apa ni</malay> executive committee
who do they have
nicholas aaron #khoo# <malay>macam</malay> familiar [jer] <malay>nama tu</malay>

why I was asking #ilya# then when I
he refuse to do it because he says is a holiday
no [lah] didn't sort
I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset [what] like last time also holiday is like finish up the
(um)
assessment book that kind but the thing is right (um)
was #ilya# <malay>ni bila</malay>
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like (um)
I see okay I ask her [lah] [oh] when you have one dollar then I start <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia dah</malay> then I say what is that
(uh)
[oh] like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like !hey! I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like !huh! maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
then <malay>baru dia</malay> like
okay okay and (uh)
that's usual [lah] cause #ilan# was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you [what]
timetable [kan]
I never teach her timetable [lah] I always subtraction <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> count backwards
<malay>dengan tu</malay>
like like she can even ask me like when I said
like <malay>apa</malay> (um)
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
[eh] (err) one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me (err) is it (err) minus or plus
you get I mean is like what do you do you buy something you still get more money [ah] or you lose money or you take away and she go [oh] <malay>duit</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> no I find <malay>dia tak</malay> grasp the concept <malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>dia cuma</malay> like [oh] I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent [ah]
ya ya ya that kind of thing
like #ilan# is some one <malay>senang nak tangkap sebab dia</malay>
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff [lah]
but for her <malay>dia punya</malay> ya the concept
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her [ah]
then I because I at the same time <malay>aku pun</malay> spring clean #ilan's# room I threw quite a lot like all those also gonna throw (err) except for that cotton on (uh) paper bag [ah] <malay>tu barang-barang</malay>
<malay>atas</malay>

even though the thing is like <malay>cemerlang</malay> for
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so

he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay
introduction ya ya definitely but you cannot first paragraph [jer] good <malay>lepas tu</malay> lousy right
he just
punctuation marks I don't know why

#bukit panjang#
(mm) <malay>dia</malay> also <malay>macam</malay> moved also I think
[ah] but #bukit panjang# to #bukit panjang# <malay>tak salah</malay>
it's not between me and my family it's between it's the both of them [what] it's their it's their property
it's up to her (err) she made plans with the other agent
you know right because #changi# has a team then he the rental he give so I was like actually he sells
I think he sells better [lah] <malay>sebab dia ada</malay> <malay>banyak</malay> followers
but she already give to I don't want bad blood [lah]
not nice she already said to the one <malay>yang</malay>
she rent out the the rental <malay>punya</malay> agent
that she wants to such told the rental agent
ya but
you know when
when the agent <malay>ada banyak</malay> contacts and <malay>banyak</malay> followers it's easier to sell [lah]
(mm)
what has changed
(mm)
the calculations whether it's better
yup
I don't know I don't know what is
[oh] really but when is it going to [ah]
no plans to move what do they expect to
then the only way is to rent [lah]
because they cannot you cannot buy in time [what] it's gonna be end of the year
I don't know man
ya did he mention like
ya another two more minutes
fast
okay <malay>macam mana besok</malay>
<malay>besok</malay> is
ya please please and
#ilya# first
just now when did (err) why did (uh) your friend calling me
(mm)
confidential stuff
confidential stuff
(mm)

okay so is actually (um) in which year [eh] you <malay>nak</malay> get married [eh
[oh] so this one is (um) actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding [kan
tru
(um) but again I thin
(err) you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a <malay>bilik</malay> or a room <malay>yang</malay> like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with [lah] correct or no
ya [lah] correct [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I think you you both have to think what's the budget [lah] so budget actually <malay>berapa</malay> is it a combined wedding <malay>ke</malay
(mm) okay okay [lah] then I think <malay>kita</malay> we have to take a look part by part [lah] [kan] like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and (um) so basically is between like (err) in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
[oh] ya [lah] that one I think normal [lah] since my time many years ago also same also [lah] the thing ya so I think (uh) ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for [lor] at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least [lah
[oh] because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need [kan] <malay>macam</malay> lik
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
(mm) I think I think in this case [ah] I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like [ah
which one you want to cut down [ah] on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say (uh) if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat [lah] because apparently like <malay>macam</malay> flat <malay>kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat</malay> !chey! <malay>sepanjang hayat</malay> [ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
like I say (uh) the the most important thing is the the the <malay>nikah</malay> itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
more fundamental [lah] but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya #gemod# [lah] #gemod# is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know (uh) his side [ah
hundred fifty ya [seh] hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise [lah] it's lik
(um) family support have to come in so that's why that day you all <malay>kena macam</malay> plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture [lah] that [one] have to be very like (um
(um) very like (uh) transparent but in the event if let's say both side <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you <malay>ada</malay> your own plan of your (uh) I mean his side <malay>ada dia punya</malay> own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to <malay>fikir</malay> or think about i
like okay in that case we do separate [lah] that is another alternative [ah] other alternative then your side then [ah] then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech [oh] !wah! like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb <malay>tak</malay> so that is another another way [lah] [kan] <malay>macam kita nak</malay> (um) try to put everything in hand [lah
so wedding time at least your side <malay>macam</malay> okay then for your side (uh) you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget [eh] sometimes <malay>kita kena fikir</malay> that in terms o
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in <malay>kita punya (err) <malay>orang melayu kita macam</malay> sensitive [ah] about <malay>duit ni</malay> so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families <malay>belum</malay> sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about <malay>duit pun kita adik-beradik masih</malay> sensitive <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [eh] just <malay>bang aku mau pinjam duit kau</malay> [lah] <malay>satu ribu macam suka suka</malay> [jer] <malay>nak minta [kan] abang</malay> you know I have to be like more tactful to u
<malay>kak</malay> are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case <malay>lagi</malay> the other party <malay>yang</malay> your parents <malay>belum kenal</malay> [kan] and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
(uh) bottom line you both must tel
(err) got two choice if want to combine the

extra guest whereas for his (uh) no need then you [leh] you just you just invite [lah] whoever that is important between your lis
because there are two factors you need to think first (um) <malay>kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak</malay> because you all just become a new family member secon
(err) then is like you al
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup [lah] <malay>tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh</malay> then after this the next time <malay>dia pergi rumah</malay
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say [ah
like <malay>macam</malay> (err
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get (err
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
and then july got a flat [ah] my <malay>kita punya</malay> timeline two years <malay>tu nak engage</malay
you know then <malay>tak tahu macam mana tahu</malay> bought flat then because [ah] because <malay>atuk</malay> said better
<malay>cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri</malay> then after that we are like [ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] haywire all I received only fla
<malay>kita punya</malay> like dream wedding <malay>kita punya</malay> dream vacation <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] flash toilet [jer] <malay>tu begitu</malay> [ah] so it's lik
then after that I think (um) at that tim
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
(um) <malay>makanan tapi</malay> [kan] shamefully I have to admit even I [dah] work that time [kan] I <malay>tak boleh</malay> afford [tau] because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like <malay>macam</malay> even like you know the bridal like you all have all these [ah] then I think I can only afford the photos <malay>begitu</malay> that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even <malay>hantaran nak</malay> exchange [ah
(um) I think quite I I would say I like <malay>macam</malay> drag it [lah] but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> I think in the en
we buy some things on our sid
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay [lah] why not <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk</malay> exchange <malay>hantaran</malay
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all [lah] ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually (um) pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push [ah] you no need to type [ah] you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes [ah] food [ah] food dishe
(uh) the equipment that include all the (err) the <malay>kompang</malay> and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so <malay>kita kena tengok macam mana</malay> [lah] [kan] so is lik
you will you will see like [ah] how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
(uh) tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of [eh] (um
<malay>orang melayu kita ni</malay> actually (err) come with a lot of (err) <malay>gotong royong</malay> even though <malay>kita tak sekampung</malay> [lah] not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like <malay>macam pinjamkan kereta</malay> you know so when if you no
(err) how to say #farah# see you just like okay [lah] whatever people (uh) rent you okay [lah] something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like <malay>macam</malay
(uh) certain relative got this car whatever they say [eh] I #chope# your car <malay>dulu</malay> for the coming wedding can or not just ask [lah
you know or maybe like <malay>dekat dekat</malay> wedding <malay>tu</malay> you ask becaus
(uh) <malay>dulu</malay> I in this case usually [lah] people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
(uh) we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar [lah] [pe] [seh] joke [ah] I'm not racist [tau] but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing [lah] so it was just like <malay>kita</malay> like just focu
(uh) what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place [lah] then after that (uh) if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
(uh) then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
<malay>ataupun</malay> early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out <malay>agak agak</malay> because by that time you [dah] start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly <malay>berapa</malay> one month <malay>berapa dapat</malay> sav
so basically you can <malay>agak agak</malay> already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one [ah
[ah] so then from there [oh] then you all like [oh] okay [lah] then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
[ah] so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline [lah] so that even though you got five months (uh) to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say #khatib# (uh) when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like (uh) the cabinet or whatever because I believe (uh) you got to check that one [lah] renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask (err) K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this [lah] there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that [ah] so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it [lah] that is one part of it ya so ya [lah] so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care [kan
my only thing is that okay if he's (uh) you all have to like let's say workout [lah] the thing [lah] workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it (uh) on i
[oh] I think (uh
this one take time [lah] but again (uh) I think #hairin# (uh) or or #hairin# [lah] <malay>siapa</malay> [lah] (uh) maybe is t
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because (uh) you <malay>ini</malay> [kan] actually <malay>masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>yang mereka</malay> seems like okay okay <malay>tapi tak</malay> okay <malay>kot</malay
ya <malay>memang</malay> [lah] (um) to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like <malay>macam secara</malay> positive ya so at least that <malay>macam</malay> you know what you can (um) do best within this (err
(uh) constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it [lah] so let's talk about happy things [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stress [jer] <malay>cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita</malay> happy <malay>pulak dalam pasal pasal</malay> wedding <malay>ni</malay
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okay actually that time you got share with me [kan] <malay>tentang mak andam</malay> like quality of <malay>mak andam</malay
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan [lah
ya okay <malay>macam itu kira</malay> not too bad [lah] [kan] because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like <malay>macam</malay> prepare and then both both parents are okay [ah] it's just anyway you also have time also <malay>nak</malay> save money you kno
but then you have to stay in one place for two years [lah] or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking (err) is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay [kan] then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that [ah
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because (um) certain country [dah] already open [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> you can just like chill relax [lah] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam nak fikir fikir sangat</malay> [kan] then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house [ah] that's another advantage [lah
[ah] <malay>ini pun</malay> if let's say both side okay [lah] I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like <malay>kita macam</malay> like okay [jer] like <malay>nikah</malay> is that correc
[oh] I think that part can't be helped right we all <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam</malay> happy happ
know you are like can can just like (uh) <malay>kita sama sama</malay> you know <malay>ramai ramai meraikan</malay> !chey! <malay>macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>saja mengeratkan silaturahim</malay> so I think can [lah] I think we jus
(uh) take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming [lah] so there's one one idea you can hav
[ah] but now I think for now don't take it as (uh) <malay>macam sedih nak kahwin</malay> [kan] you just more like if all the all the (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time [lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both <malay>kena bincang</malay
<malay>sebaiknya</malay> like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month <malay>macam kena ada</malay> like your own goals [lah] but if let's say if both of you like very <malay>nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want <malay>nak buat</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>biarlah</malay> you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
(um) to prioritise [lah] then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say family <malay>kata</malay> [oh] no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit [lah] [ah] okay option one I let go the fla
you can have the big wedding but (err) we have to burden one of the side [lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat [lah] [kan
[ah] that's another option [lah] that means to get a resale flat maybe <malay>dalam</malay> three five years that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] you know our relativ
some of them <malay>ada</malay> so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like (uh) just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
okay so (err) if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you know [ah] <malay>sendiri sendiri yang macam nak</malay> spend [lah] so if let's say if this side <malay>kata</malay> okay <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
[ah] then okay then so <malay>semua boleh</malay> centralised <malay>atau pun nak</malay> separate <malay>itu</malay> another one [lah] [ah] because I thin
about <malay>tunang</malay> he can never be meet everywhere [lah] [kan] like <malay>macam semua</malay> happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam boleh</malay
then okay [loh] <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> [oh] too bad [lah] because (um) either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then (uh) so you spend lavishly [ah] your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
for you to (uh) come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor [lah] okay then if there's an option two that both parties <malay>cakap</malay> okay [lah] why not we bought (uh) you know <malay>yang</malay
norms [lah] <malay>sederhana</malay> [jer] like very minimal number of (um) (err) what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it [lah] finish okay [dah] <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> [lah] that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion (uh) of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like <malay>macam tahu</malay> okay <malay>kita ada</malay> this amount <malay>kita ada ni kita boleh</malay> prepare <malay>macam ini</malay> [ah] then [ah
<malay>orang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang mampu macam ini</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan] like it's like you know we can't be #bo# #chap# in everything <malay>sebab</malay> we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that (err) you <malay>apa ni</malay
[oh] ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide [lah
[ah] what they want [lah] [ah] because I thin
(err) for you both all you want is just <malay>nikah</malay> maybe take beautiful pictures go (err) nice honeymoon then [dah] <malay>habis</malay> then after that focus <malay>kat rumah</malay
[oh] okay okay <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is (err) more important than <malay>hantaran hantaran</malay> is culture <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is <malay>agama</malay
[ah] so <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is part of the (err) <malay>macam dalam dalam</malay> term <malay>dia dalam</malay> arab is called <malay>maha</malay
so <malay>maha</malay> is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount <malay>yang kita dapat tu</malay> minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken <malay>yang kasi</malay> the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
[ah] you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which <malay>negeri</malay> ya <malay>dia orang lagi</malay> emphasise <malay>mas kahwin</malay> then a gift gift <malay>tu hantaran</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi dia orang</malay> [ah] that is culture <malay>melayu kita ni terbalik</malay> [ah
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] gift <malay>tu lebih</malay> high <malay>daripada mas kahwin</malay> but right it should be another way but I think (err) <malay>mas kahwin ke</malay
(err) <malay>hantaran</malay> (err) for me [lah] I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents <malay>cakap tak nak ambil</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way (err) sometimes <malay>rilek</malay> [jer] [lah
(err) you can have the best of both worlds [kan] <malay>jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi</malay> important [lah] [kan] [ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already [dah] <malay>pening kepala</malay> [lah] [kan] like very (um) you know so you you just got to <malay>doa</malay> for awhile <malay>rilek</malay> you know don't need to thin
(err) so in detail yet but at least to think okay now <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] you know what is among all these things <malay>yang macam</malay
(err) mix up what is it like like you think that [oh] what I want to have [oh] I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it [lah
like you can because you think things that you can control <malay>macam</malay> budget photographer your brother [ah] these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that [ah] if let's say for example [ah] we exchange (err) three <malay>saja</malay> [lah] item let's say for exampl
okay [ah] for example [a'ah] <malay>cuma satu</malay> I this one I don't know [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> I should have known luckily I never [ah] exchanged <malay>quran</malay> do you know that what is i
in other in one I read about in (err) on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing [lah
like (uh) okay so <malay>jada</malay> is common <malay>tapi</malay> [seh] <malay>jada kita tahu</malay> you will be used for (um) after marriage in when we play together but when talking about <malay>quran</malay> and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you <malay>hantar al quran</malay
I don't okay y
you mean the <malay>hantaran</malay
both side actually exchange gift [ah] how many you want to have it depend
[oh] <malay>duit</malay> that one that one is the <malay>mas [eh] <malay>ini</malay> not <malay>mas</malay> [kan] that one is (err) !alah! <malay>hantaran</malay> [lah] ya [lah] but some give cheque [ah] nowaday
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow [lah] no need [lah] I pay now [loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it [lah] ya if you ask me can be cheque <malay>kosong</malay> [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha
okay what righ
cheque <malay>kosong</malay> what but inside is PayNow [leh] is direct transfe
[ah] so is all depends [lah] but again if follow tradition ya [lah] they want to see for real to sure <malay>masih</malay> cash you know you know bank not
[ah] but I think in today's context can be just lik
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but <malay>mesti</malay> there's a transaction and PayNow
if not screen shot and then you se
(mm) it happens [ah] actually happens during my time also is like [oh] because they only said [lah] when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so [ah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot <malay>tapi</malay> to know each other's partner is very very important so i
if let's say you know the [oh] your partner [ah] really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either (um
like I said [lah] is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
(uh) get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like (err) like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
so I think like this (uh) family support is one factor very very important to me [lah] that's why (err) I mean culturally <malay>kita melayu</malay> is very united <malay>satu hati</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kita</malay> you know [lah] we are lik
we always like (um) always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples <malay>susah</malay> even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also [lah] but the thing is like people also like <malay>sibuk</malay> and go and go and comment y
ya [lah] she wants the opinio
[oh] it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that <malay>tapi</malay> out there maybe <malay>dia pakai</malay> card card card <malay>tapi tak</malay> shar
[ah] there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like (err) the person (uh) then where the family said firmly talk [oh] it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that (uh) kind of situations o
per per per person or individual like that like <malay>macam tak tunjuk</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay
(err) like no communication with their families feel like <malay>tak tunjuk</malay> or what [lah] ya so that can happen [tau] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak tak tak ada</malay> then why you ask me after seven years dating <malay>pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke</malay> [kan] maybe all the while the guy only show up front [oh] <malay>aku ada hadiahkan</malay> best best you kno
[ah] <malay>dia bukan pun tak tunjuk</malay> kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging [eh] <malay>macam berlakon</malay> staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating [ah] but some people ya carry on maybe like for example <malay>dia</malay> partner no [ah
the other party <malay>tu tak ada duit</malay> maybe <malay>tak</malay> you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe [lah] should be okay [lah] <malay>nanti kahwin pun</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam sekarang</malay
(um) he has so many money <malay>aku minta pun</malay> okay [jer] [ah] you know sounds like but I the end when the person say [oh] (uh) he's in debt for the wedding <malay>ini</malay> ya actually that is not the only on
I think <malay>dari zaman</malay> our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P #ramlee# sho
[ah] lie [lah] borrow the #chetty# [lah] you know that that particular #chetty# will always just borrow lend the money to them what (um) high interest and then end up <malay>hutang</malay> because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
(err) kills the that particular portion [lah] but in this younger generation in your generation (err) things have changed progressivel
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> family understand family <malay>tahu</malay> what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them !wah! very have good job then they get flat <malay>dengan</malay> with their pa
they cannot even get flat [eh] they must buy a condo or private propert
[ah] high ceiling income but then (err) there's one period of time he changed jo
so there's (uh) about three months is like or four months ya <malay>tak</malay> start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know [ah] and then they finally got it [ah] then but there's a word then the reaso
(err) a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple [lah] ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no [lah] to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already [ah
that's why he told me [lah] [kan] so like <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>kelakar</malay> then I was like abby you all <malay>gaji</malay> seventy eight thousand [dah
like very stress then me [leh] then ho
then like let me [oh] <malay>mampus</malay> [ah] like that like that then he said no [lah] it's just tha
(uh) you know the more th
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like (uh) like <malay>macam peribahasa melayu apa</malay> the <malay>apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
[ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] don't know [lah] there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that [lah] which I always think [oh
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception (um) but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
to know you usually parents [ah] whether to let go kids to <malay>kahwin</malay> I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
you know and [ah] both ways [lah] both parties [lah] so (uh) people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects [lah
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich [lah] right no need to be like so <malay>kaya</malay> or whatever you just need to have like (um
[ah] more than enough like can start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you can pay your bills you know you can you can (uh) you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid

(mm) okay [lah] angry [lah]
okay
<malay>cuma cuma dia punya masa tu</malay> thinking is <malay>dia nak pergi sana cepat</malay> so <malay>dia ada</malay> time to makeup [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) okay [oh] okay okay
for bride [lah] ya you <malay>dah</malay> plan [pe]
ya okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tu tak boleh jadi</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh</malay> [seh]
!huh! [oh]
<malay>kirakan sekarang ni macam</malay> they are <malay>macam</malay> (err) they messed up the (err) planning
some some some <malay>mak andam</malay> because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning [lah] okay
okay
okay <malay>dia</malay> panic [lah] okay
okay
<malay>kirakan</malay> flexible [lah] okay okay (uh huh)
(mm) <malay>jadi kirakan kalau macam</malay> if we do <malay>nikah</malay> and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether
okay
[oh] <malay>kirakan bukan pasal</malay> delay <malay>pasal</malay> they earn more [lah] no [lah] we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
<malay>tapi</malay> [oh] but you know how their charges are is like per whole [oh] not [oh]
but usually they won't try to delay unless really special occasion [ah] ya
okay
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> #prata# okay
a bit greasy [ah]
<malay>sakit perut</malay>
[oh] most of your friend also do at fort canning [ah]
okay
I see
okay <malay>jadi mak andam</malay> is not requirement unless you have (err) several outfit change
[oh] okay okay <malay>jadi sama</malay> [lah] I think for my side I think I don't want to have <malay>mak andam</malay> I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have (err) ya
(mm) but but she have no experience
true also
okay
okay
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah] cause you want what you want [lah] okay
okay
I I even thought of what you know because <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>katong sana</malay> [kan] there are many (err) salon ya then we thought (err) go there early ya
but that will be strange
(mm)
ya cause very close [eh] because <malay>yang</malay> grand mercure <malay>ada banyak</malay> salon ya how good [ah] that's why I have to go there okay
peranakan day [ah] so I think ya I have to go there early
ya <malay>dia pun</malay> I email <malay>juga</malay> (mm)
(mm)
okay so that part
ya I have to ask #dewi# to do research [lah] then from there
most likely we also will do the same thing [lah] <malay>kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi</malay> [ah] the day <malay>macam</malay> one off <malay>saja</malay> [lah]
[oh] okay <malay>mak andam</malay> is for rental cause they got special rate
ya [lah] and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding [mah]
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> of course photography on the same day is the best [lah] cheapest [ah] cheapest [lah] because you do makeup all that
[oh] okay so we do the <malay>nikah</malay> and the photography after that
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
(mm)
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause (err) lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
<malay>paling senang dekat dalam</malay> hotel <malay>tu tak boleh gerak-gerak</malay>
(mm) okay
ya
(mm) ya <malay>dia nya</malay> swimming pool I ever went it looks nice [lah] so I think I need to ask the person on that day
whether to see okay
(mm) we can go up and see [ah]
(mm)
<malay>bila</malay>
really [ah] you mean you all what wedding day
you want to book the hotel [oh] we thought of booking hotel for you all so
!huh! is
okay
lucky you tell me [eh] cause we really thought of booking for you all also then dinner we can go eat ya okay
okay ya okay ya let us know [lah] because we thought of (err) booking [lah] ya
okay
okay then ya so
three three (err) I think for for your case [kan] <malay>tiga jam macam</malay> okay [ah] very manageable
ya it's is very fast I like that
<malay>apa yang</malay> teething problems
I I know one problem that you all face is the
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem <malay>aku</malay> outside [mah] but I can see people no space sit ya
(mm)
!huh! [oh] they stay back [oh]
(mm)
<malay>pasal panas</malay> [oh] ya [lah] <malay>hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat</malay> (err) lawn <malay>tu</malay> mostly <malay>budak-budak</malay> parents <malay>semua tak pergi</malay> [seh] [ah]
yes yes I saw I saw it's quite (um)
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the <malay>nikah</malay>
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
for for my case okay [lah] <malay>terus</malay> settle
(um) but it's during the (err) the you you guys got the how is it how I can't remember the walk in [ah] how you guys did the walk
is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
[oh] then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again [ah]
cause for for (err) the place I have right there's a stage <malay>jadi kalau kirakan</malay> okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> start at eleven thirty
then everything finished at twelve thirty
[eh] wait [ah]
I remember is a eleven to three [ah] ya
okay
[ah] I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau apa tu</malay> like what you said
<malay>betul juga tapi</malay> wedding <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang macam</malay> panic [kan] <malay>jadi ada sikit</malay> problem <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma apa tu</malay>
(err)
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my <malay>nikah</malay> so
<malay>nikah</malay> plus (err) tea ceremony ya
that is the main main core concept
[oh] I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
ya [lah] <malay>siapa nak ikut</malay> to the letter [kan] yes
she don't care
yes
okay cause I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
[ah] that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
<malay>kirakan</malay> I want to like <malay>macam</malay> eleven thirty to one for example is <malay>nikah</malay> tea ceremony and then
that's also the time <malay>kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar</malay> [lah]
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about (err) one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty [ah] then whole lunch [ah] then in between before the one thirty starts right (err) we have the walk in [lah] then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans [lah] some activity [lah] so for about ya
okay <malay>tapi kalau</malay> COVID <malay>dia ada</malay> different kind of rules [ah] only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
(err) out of that twenty they have to be in their table [oh] but <malay>mungkin</malay> maybe <malay>masa tu</malay> policy <malay>belum</malay> start [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I went to the Grand Mercure right and (err)
#katong# and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
[ah]
<malay>tapi tapi kalau ada apa-apa nanti kena</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> COVID infection [ah]
okay
hopefully [lah] okay
okay I see but only worry like (err) <malay>yang</malay> table <malay>yang tak</malay> mingle boring [ah] <malay>duduk tengok</malay> each other <malay>makan</malay> cannot mix with the you know
so I thought of what you know get some emcee or what [ah] ya
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> your wedding <malay>lain</malay> [tau] your wedding can mingle is a is different cause (err) your time can be taken [ah] you know speaking [ah]
<malay>kena</malay>
simple simple (hmm) okay <malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
really [ah] actually I don't want to but because I don't want to make it boring for them and I want to have like unified (err) unified
okay
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> if I
(hmm) okay okay [oh] I <malay>itu yang</malay> category <malay>macam</malay> (err) emcee [ah] <malay>yang macam</malay> too much [lah] that's why
ya I want the like (err) formal one simple one

I think it's a long way to go when they are
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but it'll be fifteen years of fun [lah] so what's usually a birthday like
(uh) <malay> macam gitu [lah] <malay> kalau birthday <malay> ni selalu we always tell people that you know [ah] really [ah] even when the adults celebrate the birthday [kan] frankly speaking !alamak! you know is really [ah] for the kids you know
it is really for them <malay> pasal macam they really get into it you know <malay> nanti [kan] (uh) <malay> bila you tell them [eh] no need [lah] anything [lah]
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like [oh] must put this must put that [oh] must sing put the candle [ah] <malay> semua ni [kan] all them [ah]
[oh]
that's why we say [lah] you know like that's what the house [ah] will come falling down I tell you
and you know [lah] usually [eh] some adults [ah] one or two of them will make the fatal mistake you know to give sugar
or sugar reduce drinks you know
[a'ah]
<malay> ini topic [eh] I tell you [eh] I think every young adult [ah] will know this topic very well
[kan] [kan] <malay> kita selalu gaduh [kan]
I think it's more frequent than that [kan] if only it was only every weekend you know <malay> pasal every weekend [kan] is when you actually see [tau]
<malay> kalau you <malay> tak nampak in the week <malay> pun [kan] <malay> nanti dorang stealth tactic you know (uh) <malay> behind your back [ah] [eh] <malay> selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
[ah] and they will (uh) how shall I put this [ah] they don't even get defensive when you tell them [eh] how come [ah] when I was <malay> kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
you know they they will just say no but that's you what you know
this is for my grandchildren !wah!
the double standard [ah] very good [ah]
[ah] so for me
no kids (uh) but I was (uh) raising <malay> itu my nephews my nieces [kan] from the time they were young [lah] (um) partly because for (err) me (err) usually [lah] I'm not around in singapore <malay> pasal
I was studying away [kan] abroad then after that when I was working also (um) I was living abroad most of the time <malay> pasal kena posting
so <malay> selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my <malay> apa abang or adik already <malay> duduk kat rumah [lah] <malay> jaga
my <malay> mak [kan] pasal my <malay> apa parents my late father <malay>dengan</malay> my <malay>mak</malay> my <malay>mak masih ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> my father [dah] <malay> arwah so I moved them into my place [lah] so when I'm home in singapore [ah] I <malay>jaga all my anak sedara</malay> [lah]
so that's why I been there done that with all the birthdays [lah] you know
(err) <malay> dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa (err) foreign service
[ah] <malay> jadi macam (err)
<malay> lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say [eh] you go [ah] [ah] then you go [lah] so to be honest [lah] I spent most of my (uh) youth away <malay> pasal belajar [kan] you know away in university
then I come back <malay> pun
as a young twenty something I'm usually out
(mm)
out of the country the thing is <malay> ye [lah] [kan] people always say [eh] but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away
that [ah] that the big different [lah] <malay> pasal most people [kan] <malay> macam business especially you go in go out <malay> keluar masuk lepas tu <malay> ye [lah] <malay> paling-paling maybe <malay> seminggu you know
one and a half weeks right go to two countries seal up your deal
[ah] so what were you doing before COVID sales

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
<malay> tapi apart from <malay> macam bonus <malay> macam grade [kan] I mean <malay> takde apa-apa macam incentive <malay> ke or
[ah]
ya
ya
ya
(uh) is just to put [ah] <malay> betul [lah]
actually [ah] your
ya actually [ah] your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend [lah] <malay> pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu [kan] one of my friend so he was
(uh) like you accountant also (err) so actually <malay> yang hantar dia so went to <malay> belajar lepas how many years [ah] three years ya three years <malay> lepas tu balik [lah] <malay> balik then of course serve the bond [lah]
serve the bond buat accounting [kan] and like you [lah] also quite good at it <malay> dia punya bond <malay> berapa [eh] <malay> enam tahun masa tu
if I'm not wrong
(uh) (uh) for accounting
not too bad <malay> pasal pun for them <malay> dorang habiskan <malay> dulu baru pergi unlike me [lah] <malay> pasal for me [kan] disrupt (uh)
then [ah] then <malay> pergi luar lepas tu [ah] <malay> balik you see so
(err) <malay> ye [lah] for
for me a bit different so <malay> lepas tu my friend <malay> balik as usual [lah] <malay> kita [kan]
keep in touch
you know especially when <malay> biasa [lah] [kan] <malay> ada baby then baby shower
<malay> lepas tu keep up <malay> lepas tu kaya-kaya then <malay> macam every <malay> dua tiga bulan you know [eh] fed up [lah] let's go have <malay> teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue [kan] suddenly he said
[eh] I'm leaving [ah] my job
his last six years [lah] [ah]

(err) I think that's just tip of the iceberg [lah] <malay> pasal masa period gini [kan] <malay> kena buat banyak [lah] I think the most important yang <malay> dorang kena buat triage <malay> macam
<malay> semua bila datang tu [kan] [ah] <malay> nanti is (uh) people like my friend and his team [lah] then they check and then they ask them [eh] you look familiar [ah] because after a while [ah]
they keep coming back <malay> tahu because now they know what to do like [oh] my back pain (uh) <malay> dapat [oh] I feeling
a bit fever [kan] and a lot of them now get full medical check up
[kan] <malay> pasal when you tell them (ugh) my chest (ugh) cannot breath sir (ugh) (ugh) (ugh) [ah] then you cannot take the risk [kan]
so my friend after a while !wah! <malay> boleh kenal muka tahu
so he will tell them [eh] you look familiar didn't I see you one month ago your over [ah]
!huh! but it's tough [lah]
because the shift work [eh]
I mean basically (err) you don't have enough people [lah]
I mean that [one] for sure [lah] it must be twenty four hours <malay> pasal you just never know when this virus will strike [kan] [ah] so <malay> sebab itu susah [eh] for your job <malay> yang last time <malay> tu so you say you cover asia pac <malay> selalunye which countries [ah]
[oh] indonesia (mm)
[ah]
[ah]
africa was actually my first department
[ah] see I'm older than you [kan] so <malay> tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk [lah] so I covered all fifty-four african countries

you know <malay> dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then go to #namibia# then go ghana then go #botswana#
then come back [ah]
then after one month [eh] you go back there again then you go to you know (um) <malay> macam #namibia# then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
[kan] (um) <malay> macam gitu [ah] but back then [ah]
[ah] you cannot stay too long [lah] <malay> pasal
got a lot of things to do [kan]
within say three days you are in one country [ah] !wah! you just pack the program
from breakfast early breakfast or you may even have working breakfast [kan]
so from that time [ah] you know <malay> sampai ke malam [ah] then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work [kan]
so [ah] it's fun [ah] especially when you're twenty something [kan] <malay> penat pun penat [lah] of course but you know it's fun get to see the world [ah] by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone [ah] I'm different era
(uh) no distraction but also [kan]
you must understand [ah] so much harder I mean <malay> dulu

then (uh) you cannot find (uh) where you're going <malay> mana ada Google map Google Earth <malay> ni semua right so !wah! everyone <malay> cakap [eh]
now [ah] I cannot imagine [ah]
how you all last time [ah] work without all these [ah]
and I always tell people ya you all [ah] think now life so #mafan# [ah] <malay> susah [lah] <malay> ini [lah] <malay> itu [lah] <malay> leceh [lah] you know but imagine my time I told them started work [ah] no laptop is this thing called [ah] desktop

(uh) when internet came along and then you are supposed to (uh) surf and
do some research [kan] then you must call up

<malay> budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus [eh]
[eh] good [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
now they are smart they know what to to target
I went through that whole <malay> apa (uh) how shall I put this [ah] I went through that whole cycle [ah] [kan] that whole cycle [ah]
of dora the explorer thomas the train ben ten
power ranger
twinx the magical fairy <malay> ini semua [kan] that that was I went through the whole cycle
[kan] then you have to be always referee [kan] <malay> nanti (uh) <malay> yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband <malay> lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else <malay> abang [ah] then you have to be referee [kan] then when the cousin <malay> semua datang [ha] <malay> lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>kalang kabut
then you know [lah] I'm not a big fan of letting them watch anything
on (uh) handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them <malay>kalau nak tengok semua</malay> share okay
[ah] good for you [ah]
[ah] <malay> macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right <malay> macam mana pun [kan] I mean cannot [lah] you know when ipad first started [kan] I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put [kan] <malay> dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
<malay> macam kenapa [lah] you know maybe [lah] you call me jurassic [eh] <malay> pasal I'm conservative about this thing [kan] <malay> macam !huh! why is your baby looking at Youtube [lah] and this and that [kan] to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry <malay> pasal dia punya lung
get exercise <malay> tahu
<malay> cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor [lah] you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying <malay> pasal babies are
basically crying for attention you know and once they have human touch as you know you [kan]
father of four [kan] you <malay> tahu [lah] [kan] <malay> budak-budak ni semua <malay> bila nangis then you <malay> kasi attention <malay> sikit aja semua okay
but I don't understand [ah] this parents [kan]
[ah] there must be other horror stories you see [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
exactly exactly [ah] <malay> sama [lah]
no <malay> pasal you <malay> pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family <malay> keluar [kan]
it's getting to be quite disturbing to me [lah] [eh] you know is quite disturbing [lah] no you go and see especially pre COVID when families can go out [kan] then you see [eh] father mother two kids maybe [ah] maybe got maid [lah] [eh] doesn't matter
then everyone is looking at their phone
while eating you know so to me is like [eh]
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point [ah] [oh] my friends <malay> semua marah if I
say things like that you know [ah] <malay> kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so <malay> macam no [lah] you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures [what]
right so what
<malay>kenapa</malay> I don't <malay>tak faham apa-apa</malay> you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids [ah]
said [oh] basically you can't be bothered [lah] you know to to to talk to them ask them ask them also no point they don't tell you what happened they just say okay okay okay
said <malay> biasa [lah]
[eh] let's face it [lah] you know even we as teenagers [ah] last time [kan] remember when your mother <malay> tanya score <malay> macam mana [ah] okay [lah]
[kan] despite the fact that you had two fights that day
lost your homework <malay> kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
took it play a joke on you but when you come home just say okay [lah] nothing
where is up to you know as the parent for you too
[ah] tease out [kan] bit by bit and find out <malay> semua [kan] all these kinds of things [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
(mm)
fullstop correct correct
and it's not shift work you know
you you are a parent twenty-four seven
no I think until you basically die I always remind people <malay> pun [kan] you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them [ah] you are still [ah]
a six year old you know ya so that parenting continue and so that's something I always remind
people over and over again [lah] [kan] <malay> pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off <malay> macam even <malay> lepas I <malay> hantar last time [lah] [eh] my <malay> anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
afternoon I check in [what]
although <malay> ada maid ada <malay> dia punya you know grandmother <malay> kat rumah [kan]
but I will just check in okay everything okay you know came back K do homework or not are you know check check check right then when you come home is the same [lah] you know A you know tomorrow got what [ah] got not you know got this now whatever
it's twenty four seven you cannot say like you say [lah] you know you cannot okay for two hours I cannot go up because it's my
duty you know no [lah] nothing to do with that
nothing
but I don't think it's it's just you I think (uh) there are still a small but good number of people <malay>yang macam</malay> you and that's good <malay> tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about <malay> setahun gitu for one
right cause I was an adjunct I was an adjunct lecturer then I saw the kind of (err) students that we have these days
even the good [ones] honestly [ah]
when you
you know take some time talk to them [kan] <malay> tanya-tanya macam mana [kan] then you realize actually they are quite neglected
(err) by parenting
and usually it's parenting by default meaning [ah] is the maid
(mm) <malay> tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know <malay> macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them <malay> macam manja-manja dengan teacher <malay> pasal macam
that is their their parental figure
[dah] [lah] <malay> every day pergi sekolah [kan] and even during COVID and home based learning [kan] they see the teacher still online [kan] <malay> pasal
you are looking at the laptop [kan] and what not ya and although parents now K [lah] belatedly realised !hey! you know actually
quite good to spend time at home spend more time with family and all that
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two [kan] !wah! <malay> budak-budak semua balik sekolah [kan]
no more home based learning for many schools [kan] !wah! most parents hurrah hurrah <malay> pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out !wah!

liverpool everton newcastle (um) all sorts of names which today are like a lot of the kids weren't even really remember unless they are really hardcore historian [ah] [kan] you know they track track [kan]
so we go and we go <malay> bukan (uh) division one <malay> aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for <malay> yang macam
secondly thirdly [kan]
and back then also people go up three to two two to one you know and go up and down the league also very fast last time
<malay> pasal takde big name <malay> takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
so that was (uh) always a lot of fun [lah] you know when I was also a student [ah]
then fast forward when you mention paris [kan] I actually (uh) live there two thousand four two thousand eight
(mm) (mm) (mm) I was posted to paris <malay> tapi from paris I also cover (uh) three other countries [lah] I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so <malay> empat
country [lah] <malay> yang kena jaga so for me [ah] when people come usual [lah] you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget [ah] I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
not the duty free but the premium outlet
[ah] <malay> pasal
[ah] because that [one] is one stop
[oh]
euro Disney you see
[ah]
so a lot of people will go there to go premium outlet [lah]

housewives all these <malay> makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
[ah] dinner set the porcelain and all that you see
[ah] <malay> dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world [lah] so !wah! #shiok# you know so I was in paris (uh) two zero four to eight so <malay> empat tahun [ah] <malay> kat situ
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) I live (err) I lived in (err)
(err) the eight
sorry sixteen in the sixteen
(err)
quarter [lah] they call it [ah] so I'm literally halfway between #champs elysees# the arc of #triomphe# to and eiffel tower
so from my window every night [kan]
<malay> nanti nampak yang that <malay> lampu tu [lah] [kan] <malay> dia macam lighthouse [kan] every night [ah] [ah] so I'll see that light [lah]
circling circling
so I lived in the really the central part [ah]
[oh] so easy for me pasal I just walk to office only about ten minutes
ya so it's quite (uh) good
(mm) [ah] that's the #gare du nord# (mm) (mm) (mm)
the museum [ah] [ah]
[eh] <malay> penat juga budak-budak
[ah]
<malay> naik stroller [lah] two of them
[ah]
actually #gare du nord# when you <malay> keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal <malay> banyak kebab <malay> banyak yang #maghrebian# <malay> nya [kan] <malay> yang daripada morocco <malay> daripada daripada mana [eh] (uh)
ya [lah] (mm) the #maghreb# areas [lah] (mm) morocco algeria you know those kind of places
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
they they call it #bateaux mouches# the flyboat
[ah] <malay> ada dua option satu you just <malay> naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
[ah] [ah]
burn down [ah]
so you saw when it was still
[oh]
no it's actually [eh] really really
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down <malay> pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's <malay> macam symbol [lah] paris [kan] so <malay> bila
[ah]
<malay> bukan sabotage <malay> bukan ada terrorism
[ah] sebab itu [lah]
<malay> sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat <malay> ni semua dorang touring [kan] it's really really
!wow! you know it's really inspiring you see
ya and I do miss (uh) living there <malay> pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world [lah] you know without a doubt [lah] you know
ya
paris [eh] <malay> memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london <malay> macam K [lah] you can walk a bit a bit [lah] <malay> tapi after a while <malay> macam
[ah] boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and <malay> macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery [kan]
(mm)
correct correct
I agree
correct don't look down you know I always tell people when you're in paris [ah] look up you know ya
I mean once in a while
<malay> kena tengok bawah [lah] <malay> pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni [kan]
[ah] then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place [lah] you know so it's quite good to go
they got [lah] <malay> nanti after COVID
[ah]
after COVID even for me <malay> pun frankly [lah] [eh] <malay> lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore [lah] <malay> pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly <malay> dekat singapore [lah]
<malay> tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice [lah] <malay> pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my <malay> mak [kan] seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend [ah] <malay> masuk #johor# [lah]
(mm)
(mm) and also <malay> pun !aiya! you know <malay> boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids [kan] like I've got even (uh) grand nephews grand nieces [kan] <malay> yang dekat malaysia then its easy to (uh) go to
Legoland [kan] <malay> pergi makan-makan
relax relax you know so quite fun [lah]
you know (uh)
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen [ah] I suspect will probably
only be able to travel [kan] pergi #johor# and whatever <malay> sebelum kita boleh really go out there again [lah]
know <malay> dekat-dekat [lah] you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know (um) <malay> pasal every day before COVID [kan] between two hundred to three hundred thousand [eh] <malay> dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu [kan] <malay> bukannye satu dua ribu [kan]
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know [lah]
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right <malay> pasal apa dia punya
<malay> penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
[ah]
paradigm paradigm (mm)
(uh) paradigm about two years about two years [ah]
(mm)
ya ya [ah]
obviously [lah] but also don't forget catered also for the #johorians# who work here <malay> pasal
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this [lah] pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks [kan] so
[ah] even for your maid you know today anyway [lah] [eh] these days
as soon as you hire one [kan] then <malay> dorang buka [kan] payroll payroll <malay> nye tu [ah] so <malay> dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
[ah] <malay> dia by two [kan] when you go there <malay> sekarang some shops [lah] they definitely accept Nets which is good [lah] you know
<malay> pasal even for their workers [kan] <malay> lepas tu balik malaysia [lah] <malay> nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up</malay> [kan] <malay>nak tukar duit
[kan] when their salary is already in sing dollars so <malay> dorang !alah! pakai Nets aje [lah] <malay> lebih senang
<malay> tak susah
but you can tell [ah] <malay> macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites [kan] <malay> yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town <malay> betul [lah]
is really bad <malay> macam city square <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
(um) <malay> orang semua tengok !wah! really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully [lah] it'll be a slow and painful process [lah] but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not <malay> macam kita aje [kan] you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so <malay> macam gitu aje [lah]
[ah]
[ah] that's always good question <malay> tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me <malay> macam each one is so different [kan] so
but generally [lah] my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
you know ya <malay> pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know [lah] budget pun <malay> bukannye banyak [kan] even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type <malay> macam
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
you know you just <malay> ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know <malay> macam you <malay> tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you <malay> tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of <malay> teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did [lah] you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd <malay> lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends [kan] [ah] so for me that's where it's quite you know
that that's more it [lah] you know
but I must say (um) not so much now [lah] but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me <malay> pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest <malay> yang dorang <malay> baru [jer] <malay> buka [kan] (err)
(err) not not easy [lah] to go in [kan] that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
<malay> orang asing you know so was a lot of fun [lah] you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
see the developments but the changes [kan] since my time there and it's been what you know (uh) more than twenty years [kan] almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
[ah] [ah] okay good we are one hour already
[ah] we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now

okay so the topics that we will be talking today [ah] it's (um) firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
(um) fifty <malay>betul</malay>
so <malay>maknanya kalau</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau</malay> if you <malay>yang</malay> in ten years time <malay>memang</malay> you want to be in an area <malay>yang ada laut yang ada</malay> greenery where
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>kalau untuk saya</malay> for me [eh] I think [eh]
for me [ah] I like science [lah] so maybe ten years in the future [kan] I would want to have
I would like to live in my own lab <malay>atau</malay> garage
and maybe <malay>sebelah</malay> would be my like lab apparatus <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and [ah] whatever there is [lah] so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also (uh) ten years time probably (um) I would like to
(uh) I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
so if I have my own lab I would probably (uh) maybe add a telescope <malay>atau</malay> like some meeting devices so that I can
focus on my (uh)
my computing whatsoever [lah]
yes
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe (uh) so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so (mm)
<malay>katanya</malay> if say let's say you were
(uh) you were in your future house
and then (um) maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
(mm)
mind is stimulated [ah]
martial arts <malay>gitu</malay>
(uh) more to like action thriller
<malay>macam nak kena</malay>
(uh) okay for for me (uh) I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you (uh) in-hand situations about (uh) about issues that could surface in the future [lah] (uh) technology areas or
(uh) any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and (um) I think it it it gives me like <malay>macam</malay>
something to think about
ya and and make you like [oh] it helps me to
solve problems easily and (uh) see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode [eh]
<malay>yang satu orang ni</malay> (uh) she was actually (uh) she was actually trapped in a spaceship
the reason why she was trapped is because (um)
(uh) her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
computed her body into into a technological (uh) into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone [ah] <malay>orang sendiri</malay> [tau] so
so the boss <malay>memang memang jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>gilanya orang</malay>
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting [lah] how they plan to (uh) get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then [ah] sometimes he can [ah] turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked [lah] cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end (uh) some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so (uh) he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and (uh) there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape [lah] so it was quite surprising interesting [ah] how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that [eh] (hmm)
if you can become an actor
(uh) what
(hmm) if you can become an actor [eh] and like any actor [eh] do you prefer (uh) do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
like their their image you know what I mean <malay>faham tak</malay> ya so an image of them self you mean <malay>nak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>ada</malay> fit body <malay>atau</malay> good looks
<malay>kenapa</malay>
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
I think I will
I think I agree on that [lah] <malay>sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then <malay>buat apa</malay> [lah]
ya so I think for me <malay>kalau ada</malay> fit body is more satisfying <malay>sebab</malay>
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without without health actually (um) you can be bedridden and even the the cost of (uh)
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is [ah] not getting cheaper these days
so I think (uh) focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases [ah] correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
so <malay>macam</malay> I think health is very important [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without health <malay>memang</malay> you <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> much [lah] you can't do much actually
<malay>mencegah</malay>
<malay>kena</malay> start <malay>awal</malay> [lah]
so I think one <malay>kalau</malay> pot from having a fit body [eh]
I think
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind <malay>sebab sekarang memang</malay> as you can see [eh] mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth (err) among the working adults and among (um) teens
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be (um) how can mental health be (um) what's that addressed
and how can be (um)
how can we (uh) better improve our mental health area general
<malay>cara</malay> holistic [lah]
I think mental health also like (uh) stems from other external factors <malay>macam</malay> maybe overwhelming of
school work <malay>atau</malay>
(uh) projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have [lah] that they experience so (um) like if you can see like the education system <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang memang</malay> very (uh)
very rigorous very very broad and very
it's very intense [lah] so like what <malay>macam</malay>
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and <malay>macam memang</malay> I've been schooling [ah] and I think <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
(uh) rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given [ah] should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity [ah]
but <malay>tu memang</malay>
(uh) off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system [ah] like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but it doesn't really appease them so I think <malay>macam</malay> apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but (uh) everything has been changing and revolutionised
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
(uh) it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau] if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you <malay>macam</malay> just just <malay>kasi semua</malay> on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
(um)
(um) how many one point two grams of (uh) phosphorus is needed to make (uh) I don't know cyanide or something
<malay>macam</malay> apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics [lah] and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion <malay>bila macam</malay>
you can think of how to (uh) not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
<malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] [kan]
okay so (uh) moving on maybe let's talk about
(mm) okay so <malay>contohnya</malay> like for now [eh] we are in the twentieth twenty first century
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever [ah] where would you want to go
and why
ya
<malay>cuba</malay> like for example [eh] you <malay>ternampak</malay> a time capsule
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
[oh] when you were a little child
work studies stress [ah]
we play
(mm)
I think that's <malay>pun</malay> what I would really <malay>macam</malay> really cherish enjoy
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
(uh) memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
(um) shape you and how you are today
[ah]
probably (mm)
I I think I would want to go to
<malay>zaman</malay>
I don't know maybe <malay>zaman rasulullah</malay> <malay>atau</malay> dark ages [ah] cause (um) basically the dark ages were <malay>macam</malay> a period of time
the <malay>macam</malay>
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby (uh) in the european universe or the western part of the world
[ah] there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but (uh) there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
(um) ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and [ah] people were killed and people were died from (um)
(um) unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
(uh) the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know #sina# [ah] #al jazali#
(uh) #mariam#
#rolab# and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science <malay>bila</malay> there's this two brothers
#abu sayde# or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam [lah] I think it's very interesting to see
I think it's very interesting to see <malay>macam</malay>
the the progression during that period of times <malay>sebab sebab</malay> during that time <malay>memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan</malay> idea <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>seperti</malay>
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
during the golden age and I find it really interesting <malay>sebab</malay> how their mind
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
even in engineering and science and (uh) it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's (um) <malay>macam kita jarang tengok</malay> [ah]
<malay>dalam dunia ni sekarang</malay> [tau] most of the time [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang macam contohnya</malay> [eh] I have to (um) <malay>contohnya</malay> I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine (uh) philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once [lah] but I think <malay>macam</malay> ya I think it'll be very interesting [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you can like learn
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
<malay>sebab saya rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita</malay> just go far
<malay>sebab ilmu tu mana-mana</malay> and you can use for <malay>ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu</malay>
you [ah]
<malay>ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa</malay> as long as <malay>kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik</malay> and I think it will be very fruitful [lah]
<malay>ilmu</malay>
so apart from like
(mm) going back in time
(um) what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to (uh) have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to (um) to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal [lah] you particularly the elderly man take
(um) <malay>duit ke rumah ke</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay>
the third one
[ah]
(uh) I think first [lah] I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
(uh) I wish
(uh) I wish that (uh) world hunger can be stopped [lah] cause
or war actually can be stopped cause technically (um) <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau boleh</malay> share but technically like (uh) world hunger among there are many (um) palestinians
and they went in first world country
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [seh] <malay>orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang</malay> now <malay>orang</malay> [eh] actually <malay>tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada</malay> no access to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from (uh) camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad [lah] so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope [ah] nobody would go hungry [lah] in this world
and [ah] the second wish would be [ah]
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause (uh) we don't have the technology
because even from (um) the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
[eh] three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so (um) I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out (um) others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish (uh) actually (uh) I think I
I wish to have my own family one day #inshallah#
maybe next five ten years or so
so I think (um) having a family really <malay>macam</malay>
really helps me to
(uh) have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me [lah] I really like to learn
and <malay>kalau ada suami</malay> I would be able to
find solace in him cause <malay>memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan</malay> [kan] so I think having a spouse would be very interesting [lah]
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but (um) just hope to you know
(um) get married one day
okay so (mm)
so maybe (uh) cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
<malay>akhlak yang baik</malay> [lah]
I eat right
I think (uh) I think
<malay>tu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I can feel you [lah] I think having (uh) having status
is not really essential [lah] but apparently
(uh) you want your friend or anything
even if you want me to have good <malay>akhlak</malay>
how can I contribute better to the society
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal</malay> okay <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>kita kurang berakhlak</malay>
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada duit yang banyak tapi akhlak kita</malay>
<malay>hancur</malay> [tau]
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
<malay>akhlak</malay> is more valuable [lah] than intellect
<malay>akhlak</malay> [lah] actually even if you have your own
(uh) if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be (uh) be taught to the world
but (um) having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life [lah]
yup
respect
won't look down on you [lah]
<malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>buat yang baik</malay> [lah]
you <malay>tak ada gunanya</malay>
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's (um)
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you [lah] that (uh) having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
maybe like (um) what do you think if you <malay>macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam</malay> superpower
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> superpower like you <malay>nak jadi apa kalau</malay> what what what will you like to have right now
flash
speed [ah] speed
#inshallah#
<malay>kalau ada barang nak kemas</malay> #inshallah# [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> you know I <malay>rasa</malay>
(uh huh)
I I like to teleport [ah]
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> teleport [kan]
I <malay>takkan lambatnya</malay> cause I'm like always late <malay>kalau dapat</malay> teleport then <malay>macam</malay> on on the speed of light or even faster than that (uh) just like be wherever I want to be just teleport <malay>tak tak payah nak</malay> passport <malay>semua</malay> so I think that's very cool [ah] <malay>kalau kalau kalau dapat</malay> teleport [lah]
I think the current technology <malay>memang tak boleh</malay> [lah] unless <malay>kita ada</malay> transporter <malay>macam kat</malay> star trek <malay>ke</malay> but of course not [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi contohnya</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau macam</malay> now's the <malay>kalau</malay> cause <malay>sekarang</malay> <malay>memang</malay> is in progress [lah] what what do you think of
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
phones <malay>pun</malay> is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
(mmhmm)
<malay>sekarang</malay> google [jer]
you know is is very easily easy [lah] I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
<malay>macam kerja rumah semua terbengkalai</malay>
I think okay [lah] maybe <malay>salah saya juga</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> phone <malay>tu memang</malay> it serves like an educational purpose [lah]
ya and the entertainment purpose <malay>untuk zaman sekarang</malay>
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like [oh] [ah] when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like (um) we have (uh) we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry (um) some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to (um) playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind [lah] that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
(err) is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation [lah]
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think (uh) (uh) this thing
trait between and humans probably (uh) they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have (um)
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans <malay>ada</malay> this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things <malay>tapi macam</malay> they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very (um) like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think <malay>agaknya</malay> also I feel it's on the good side [lah] because
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
(uh) some (uh) some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
important I think apart from that I think <malay>macam</malay> humans should actually still take care of their parents and <malay>macam</malay> don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and <malay>contohnya macam</malay>
(uh) for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
(uh) like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh] [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> limit to it
I think one <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>pun</malay> very subjective [lah] <malay>sebab kita orang tak tahu</malay> like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something [lah] something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
I think ya technically <malay>macam</malay> you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world <malay>macam</malay> india they are very overpopulated <malay>kalau kita dah ada</malay> robot <malay>lagi mana nak letak</malay> [seh] human <malay>ni</malay> so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> you have to find a contingency plan <malay>sebab memang dunia ni</malay> maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting [lah] to actually to predict and cause nowadays <malay>memang</malay>
(um) especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be (um) probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
(uh) like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it [lah]
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
humans <malay>dorang betul-betul kena</malay>
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting [ah] to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from (um) human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many (um) so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even <malay>macam</malay> greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
very interesting
(uh huh)

[oh] it was so much fun after a long time I <malay>tak pergi kerja</malay> then went back so met (um)
it's a small group [lah] not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then (um) the place also okay [lah] not so busy last time used to be very busy but now (um) because of the COVID thing so companies send their
[ah] their staff
(um) <malay>macam</malay> in a small group [lah] instead of last time one big group
a participant they only allocate (uh) fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like (err) two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
[oh] I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the (err)
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
group [lah] but no more number of days <malay>dia panjang</malay> [ah] (um) james was the in charge [ah] it's quite fun [lah]
I don't know because the deal is (um) they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges [lah]
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
(um) the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge [ah] one que
and one and then myself doing (um)
but surprisingly all the participant came for
[ah]
screening right they are prepared <malay>awal</malay> you know I mean normal
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
<malay>kerja dari rumah</malay> more relax they says [ah] then they say [oh] then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
<malay>tadi tadi</malay> one is from (um) one's from mycrone
if <malay>nenek pekik-pekik</malay>
(mmhmm)
because I told <malay>bibik</malay> to give anxiety pill early
I think <malay>nenek</malay> is more on anxiety rather than depression [ah] because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
[ah] she [ah] panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
[ah] so I guess it's more anxiety than <malay>dari</malay> depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit <malay>termenung</malay> thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then (uh) there is
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause (uh) every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
and she started want to pray then she [ah] <malay>tak yakin</malay> that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and (um)
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
not (um) it's quite to say [lah] couple of days when she was at the peak (um) which is really really very I should say <malay>macam mana</malay> very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
her <malay>macam</malay> worse or <malay>ataupun dia punya</malay> (um) <malay>paling tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya mengamuk atau</malay> dementia <malay>punya</malay> (err)
level
so as what you say [lah] maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like <malay>macam</malay> quite [ah] quite more peaceful (um)
(um) more <malay>macam</malay> if she she shouted yell and (err)
but not much and then (err) at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming <malay>ataupun nak minta keluar</malay> from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
which is different [lah] this today's it's so much different from the past
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just <malay>redha</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>ikhlas</malay> and <malay>redha</malay>
ya
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone <malay>itu sahaja</malay> (um) from last time she doesn't want to be alone
she's a bit timid [lah] I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister [lah] but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really [lah]
timid is different from people who is fierce #shah# timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
<malay>hantu</malay> are not human
she's very <malay>garang</malay> human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing [lah] she's very scared the rest I don't think so [lah] <malay>macam</malay> people she's not afraid of [lah] none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
ya she went through all the assessment
of course [lah] unless she says like stupid things [lah] then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans [lah] <malay>merepek</malay> [jer] accounting but cute [lah] she answer
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that (uh) these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but (err) she turned to me and tell me of like (um)
<malay>apa ni merepek nak balik</malay> [ah] which is funny [lah]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you (um)
what's your name how many children you have <malay>lepas tu dia tanya</malay>
all the personal things [lah] then <malay>tanya</malay>
(um) past then present then <malay>tanya</malay> in between so
cute [lah] but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up [lah] so she <malay>macam ada</malay> rest and then after that continue again (um)
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no (um)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
you didn't
(mm)
(mm) ya
(mm)
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
(mm)
ya but the progression is like (um) the progression is actually <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] people
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much [ah] maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
(um) which <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] [ah] depression [lah] maybe [lah]
difficult for me to say [lah] because it involved brain and then like <malay>nenek</malay> they said that some of her brains already stroke
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
educate the caregiver <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
because <malay>dia orang ni</malay> sooner or later they going to be
(um)
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
(oo)
(uh) sooner or later she she will forgot how to (err) right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say [ah] [eh] I thought you want to (err) pass motion or you want to <malay>kencing</malay> and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that (um)
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the (uh) leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad [lah] mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
(um) professional <malay>ataupun</malay> [ah]
nurses <malay>yang</malay>
(um)
well educate about all this <malay>macam</malay> well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is (err) no the better [lah] no way I'm quite difficult [lah] this this this this dementia or old aging <malay>punya</malay> (err) problem [eh] it's going to hit the world
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
the youngsters educate the youngsters <malay>ataupun macam</malay> make it a point that
(um)
or <malay>anak mesti nak kena jaga</malay> parents <malay>atau</malay> there is this centre <malay>ataupun</malay> help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
<malay>kita kena ada</malay> this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
[eh] <malay>tak baik</malay> say <malay>dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik</malay> say <malay>tak nak jaga mak bapa dia</malay>
the because people don't go through
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that <malay>macam kita nak</malay> abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say [eh] <malay>tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak</malay>
so it's gonna be the same
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that <malay>ataupun</malay> european europe country <malay>atau</malay> the america they find that sending the
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
<malay>dalam islam</malay> okay <malay>kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan</malay> a must
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put (err) into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got (um) cousin [lah] she could say [ah] eight boys [ah] the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be (err) medical attention given to her [ah] anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then (err) third she got (um) caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver (mm) they have
(err) nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know (um) half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday (err) maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so [lah] because she's already bedridden
(um) don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this (um)
kind of <malay>macam</malay> (err) educate <malay>ataupun</malay> information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
that's that's what my opinion is [lah]
ya I know
(mm)
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this (err) dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya [lah] I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
[oh] [eh] you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
<malay>macam</malay> preparation for the future for the future or
old generation [lah]
I think so because but (mm) but I don't think so they take nowadays they <malay>dia orang macam tak</malay> encouraged but they are
they have this <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>dia tak</malay> encourage <malay>tapi dia dah dah</malay> ready
<malay>faham tak</malay>
I did in this [ah] they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you <malay>dah tua</malay> you <malay>tak nak tinggal dengan anak</malay> you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a (um) estate where a lot of amenities <malay>macam</malay> vast or or supermarket doctors <malay>dekat dekat</malay> and then (err) the whole building <malay>dia orang pun ada macam</malay> (err)
(err)
how should I say <malay>macam dia orang ada</malay>
clubhouse [lah] something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but <malay>dia orang tak macam</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh]
have campaign <malay>ataupun macam kasih</malay>
<malay>tahu dengan</malay> public no they just do it you want it
okay this (uh) we have it you know <malay>tapi dia tak ada</malay> encouragement <malay>ataupun dia kasih macam</malay> I find [lah] <malay>macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni</malay> not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
an idea <malay>ataupun dia</malay> come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system [mah]
they don't they they say said very (err) how should I say (uh) <malay>tak macam besar</malay> [tau] like very big <malay>macam siapa tahu tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>siapa tak tahu tak tahu</malay> [lah] that kind of thing
you know like like like specially our money [ah] nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
so it's kind of like <malay>macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu</malay>
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
then they are they are well informed otherwise <malay>takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang</malay> be bothered <malay>takde orang tahu</malay> [lah] (um) that's the problem [lah]
that's problem [lah] people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right (err) your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card (err) see see and then (err) this this lady said !hey! you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is (err) (err) giving some (uh) help fund because I really apply then is it [oh] you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true (mm) how to accommodate right
<malay>kita tak macam</malay> based we are free religious
(um)
(um)
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious [lah] I think the more points of
other activity <malay>macam</malay> [ah] more of entertainment entertainment and activity [lah] you know of <malay>ataupun</malay>
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite (um) (err)
complex [lah] I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
(um) I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
old folk citizen soon or not far also but (err) right now people at my age I should say <malay>ataupun</malay> people at <malay>pak</malay> age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
<malay>atau</malay> plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both <malay>ada</malay> compromise both <malay>boleh</malay> plan <malay>sama-sama</malay> and both also <malay>boleh</malay> you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
(um) I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at (err) until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't (uh) take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
<malay>macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun</malay> I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
[oh] what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the <malay>dah tak boleh juga</malay>
I <malay>kena orang</malay> then I know I don't want to burden my children (um)
<malay>kau orang</malay> share <malay>cari orang jaga mak</malay> that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday [ah] one of my children must visit me [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>ataupun nanti cuti</malay> come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> [eh] <malay>banyak karang ni</malay> I see like <malay>macam</malay> my girlfriends
are people that I know [ah] they have mom which go every week go to every are of (err) <malay>anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu</malay> I I don't know whether is it a good idea because <malay>mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin</malay> is it
[oh] at this stage [eh] <malay>dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit</malay> is it good for her to change
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
the second option is so much better because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> burden others because you see [ah]
<malay>anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul</malay> [ah] children wants to but you must also remember <malay>anak-anak</malay> not the spouse <malay>ada anak</malay> I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then (um) <malay>anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya</malay>
peace also it's like (um) <malay>mak ni macam jadi macam</malay> you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you <malay>faham tak</malay>
unless you <malay>macam</malay> okay let's see [lah] this is
[ah] what I think it's good it's like <malay>macam</malay> let's say I <malay>ada empat anak</malay> I <malay>ada dua belas cucu</malay> something like that <malay>dua belas cucu enam yang</malay> very (um) <malay>macam dah</malay> secondary school <malay>ataupun dah pergi</malay> tertiary you know which they can help
you know so <malay>empat</malay> plus <malay>enam sepuluh sepuluh ni</malay> take turn [lah] take turns to (um) go to grandma house to this (err) monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then (err) this day to this day okay <malay>mak pula yang kena tinggal sana</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> take care out <malay>dia orang ada ni</malay> [eh] <malay>ada</malay> helpers twenty four seven <malay>dekat dalam rumah tapi</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> make sure stay <malay>duduk makan tengokkan dia</malay> the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be [lah]
rather than (err) <malay>kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis</malay> I <malay>rasa macam gitu lagi</malay> better [lah] <malay>emak yang</malay> in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
you mean you're not used to it that (uh) you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
[ah] sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
monday and thursday my turn okay <malay>dia ni</malay> wednesday and friday <malay>dia ni</malay> so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
[ah] contribute no that's what I think [lah]
I I mean right now this is
(uh) right now right now right now at this situation that I (um)
at present [ah] most of my (err) friends
other elderly parents so (um) I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in <malay>mak nenek</malay> into one station the rest all have to rotate [lor] whether dementia <malay>ke tak</malay> dementia <malay>ke pun</malay> rotate
[oh] maybe <malay>macam cik rosnah</malay> [lah] <malay>cik rosnah punya mak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu satu</malay> place when maid with with the helper than everybody come <malay>cik rosnah</malay> come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then (err) also so cute then they have this like <malay>macam</malay> caregiver <malay>punya</malay> holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then <malay>anak-anak lain</malay> have to sit take care
(um) so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam pada mak</malay> [lah] better <malay>mak</malay> that way [lor] I don't know
(mm)
[oh] you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
(um) ya
[lah] you got a point there also [lah] it's what you say <malay>tapi kalau sebelum dia orang</malay> could are given a task <malay>kita kena</malay> educate [lah] the main thing here the the the role model is very important
(um) how you want to (err) how you
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them <malay>macam kita tak boleh</malay>
(um) <malay>macam</malay> !alamak! this week I cannot [lah] I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go [eh] I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to (um) <malay>macam kita kena tunjuk positif</malay> that <malay>kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita</malay> look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment [oh] I can't
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that [oh] it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
(um)
(um) ya true
ya true <malay>sebab masa tu nenek</malay> okay
but <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang nenek</malay> have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really [ah] really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand [lah]
(um) that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is <malay>kuat takpe</malay> that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know <malay>dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul</malay> because <malay>dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan</malay>
you know <malay>kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana</malay> okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one <malay>nak cuba cuba</malay> calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
<malay>siapa yang tak marah</malay> even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
you know so quickly the other
party must come out <malay>kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun</malay> [ah] <malay>ikat orang tua</malay> (um) <malay>macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang</malay>
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid <malay>itu yang buat</malay>
(um) <malay>banyak terjadi</malay> didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this [lah] because <malay>nenek</malay> is actually educating me you know
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna <malay>macam sakit ke macam</malay> (um)
<malay>bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan</malay> (um)
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
<malay>punya punya apa</malay> mental mental <malay>punya</malay>
our readiness [oh] <malay>mesti nak kuat</malay>
ya really last time I people always says [ah] <malay>tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua</malay> then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I <malay>geram sangat ke</malay> then what is <malay>syurga</malay>
<malay>macam tu</malay> I can't even reach <malay>syurga</malay> if I do this to my mum
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
I take care of her not because I want <malay>syurga</malay> I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to <malay>macam</malay>
I she's get she got annoyed her you know <malay>ataupun</malay> you know I <malay>tak boleh tahan dengan dia</malay> then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
[ah] ya that's why I said because I <malay>cakap</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> awareness [ah] so it's something that <malay>macam</malay> god is given me awareness [oh] okay this is what you need to do [lah] that I need I can plan compared
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
[ah] twenty four seven take care of <malay>punya</malay>
[ah]
<malay>orang tua</malay> and then they they they now I have [ah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard <malay>atau</malay> by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
now it's a time for them to take care of me
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through <malay>tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena</malay> take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang bila mak fikir</malay>
or as what you say [lah] don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
(err) <malay>macam</malay> knowledge <malay>macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu</malay> I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give (um) <malay>macam</malay>
a talk <malay>atau macam kasih</malay> volunteer <malay>atau</malay> told people or need help <malay>atau</malay> need advice I think I have
I have the capability [lah]
the
(um) (mm) (um)
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have (err) your energy level is our only that point of time [eh] is that much
and then you have feeling [ah] that [ah] you are human that you know that (uh) sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
(err) emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
(mm)
forever ya forever you be
ya
(um) ya true true
ya true
(mm) ya
breakdown
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing [ah] technician go machine you know <malay>macam mana</malay> machine
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion <malay>dia orang</malay> emotional <malay>dia orang</malay> is so complex that we
don't know [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> professional you are a good [ah]
it you'd secretaries <malay>apa ke</malay> all of them based on experience or <malay>dia orang punya</malay> client <malay>punya</malay> patients <malay>punya</malay> experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because <malay>dia tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak</malay> okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay <malay>kita kasih penat tapi tetap</malay> keep on scream <malay>bukan itu dia tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> scream <malay>sebab sakit perut</malay> you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being <malay>dia macam</malay> twins [lah] twins <malay>muka sama</malay> everything <malay>sama tapi tetap perangai lain</malay>
(um) (um)
somehow you were saying that family knows best [lah]
okay (err) family know best in terms of tackling one (err) let's say the mother [lah] because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
her likes and dislikes you know the (err) for the professional we bring it to the they I just (uh) based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
(err) other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> family members <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> and then (um) very important [lah]
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming (err) since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
[oh] so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> they call it (err)
trial and error also
(um) ya true
(um)
so because chicken
[oh] complain and complain
(mm) (oo) (mm) (mm)
(oo)
<malay>makan</malay> ya
[ah] nevermind just like grandma [lah] <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak bilang</malay> actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say <malay>nak keluar tak boleh tidur</malay>
you know she said [ah] <malay>mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa</malay> and then when we stopped her from going out the she said <malay>mak nak kencing</malay>
there's a [oh] <malay>sebenarnya nak kencing</malay> [eh] [ah] then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after <malay>kencing</malay> you <malay>tidur</malay> okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
(err) so sometimes <malay>kat dalam bilik pun sama</malay> and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place <malay>atau bilik</malay> is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
[oh] <malay>bilik dia sejuk</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar</malay> she keep on saying <malay>nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar</malay> then we keep asking why <malay>nak keluar</malay> then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us [ah] only if she could tell <malay>mak nak keluar</malay> because [ah] <malay>bilik ni gelap</malay> [lah] <malay>bilik ni sejuk</malay> [ah] okay <malay>kita tidur kat luar</malay> that will be much
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
(um)
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers <malay>dia dah penuh</malay> (um)
<malay>susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada</malay> some [ah]
crack <malay>ataupun</malay> ulcer <malay>ataupun sakit perut</malay> I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> baby it get get baby <malay>kita kita jaga macam dia punya</malay> journey is to be independent [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> old folks <malay>kita jaga</malay> needed is to be dependent
(mm) ya
ya true ya true
so it would so when you have a when you have to take care of a dementia person you make sure that you always do (uh) a lot of research
research and research because dementia not only happen to our community our it happen to the world so every everyone in every everyone in
I should say the world world the global global it's a global (err)
phenomena is going to be as what they say pandemics you knows
ya correct ya true okay that's about all thank you

I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana begitu</malay> but
ya like singapore <malay>memang</malay> got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated <malay>punya</malay> food places [ah] the rating it to worth exploring today maybe

#satay# soup base
!huh! really
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>hari ini</malay> cheat day
K ya so <malay>macam mana</malay>
[oh]
<malay>bukan</malay> B B nine [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
[oh]
(um) K <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(err)
<malay>ke cakap pasal</malay> shares [lah]
so
so far
I <malay>nak</malay> try [lah] <malay>baru</malay> try try I <malay>nak</malay> try stock then I <malay>macam rasa-rasanya</malay> tesla will grow [lah] in the future
<malay>sebab</malay> ya because a lot of countries are <malay>macam</malay> adopting (err) are banning petrol vehicles by
in the future
so
by investing in <malay>macam</malay> electric car company <malay>ini</malay> [kan] all those clean energy ones
(uh)
the shares would probably go up [lah] in the future like maybe not now maybe <malay>dalam lima sepuluh tahun</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> also low [kan] but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits [lah]
so what do you think how about you
!huh! serious
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance <malay>tapi</malay> I think like <malay>macam</malay> those stocks <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> permissible <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>yang tak</malay> go against the basic purpose [ah] <malay>macam</malay> those thoughts <malay>yang</malay> deal with (um) vices then
alcohol
you know all those <malay>macam</malay> clearly <malay>apa ni</malay>
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
that's my <malay>pandangan</malay> [lah] on this
okay for me [eh] I think <malay>kita kena macam</malay>
diversify [lah] our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like <malay>macam</malay>
segregate your assets [lah] so I think one good (err) platform to that we can use is
(uh) #wahed# invest so this is a <malay>macam</malay>
I as far as I know this is the
only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>syariah</malay> compliant <malay>punya</malay> stocks trading platform [lah] so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
commodities [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cash <malay>ke</malay> gold
<malay>ambil</malay> bonds and all these are like certified to be <malay>syariah</malay> compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in <malay>macam</malay> these kind of companies
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
you don't have to put in effort [lah] you just <malay>letak</malay> your money then you just
(uh) forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
based on my experience <malay>dia punya</malay> fees is
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside [lah] of of using
#wahed# invest
<malay>tapi</malay> like maybe this is one
(um)
how to say [eh]
what (err) things you have to face [lah] if you want to go through the halal way
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms <malay>yang</malay> offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
ya so you have to put up [lah] with this all these service charge [lah] when these banks
new way
true
maybe you can feedback to <malay>jangan</malay> invest in bonds
<malay>macam</malay> bank <malay>bapa kita</malay>
[oh] like <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>yang</malay> what you say is true <malay>cuma</malay>
I mean you want <malay>apa</malay> ethical investing [eh] in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
do it the halal way then it's the best [lah]
[ah] correct
[a'ah] deep
ya correct [lah] I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
those the regular accounts [lah] me you have no choice [what] <malay>tapi</malay> that's why (err) you have to do your own research [lah] if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
(err) <malay>mana-mana</malay> company I mean <malay>mana-mana</malay> banks
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>cakap pasal</malay> investment <malay>ni macam mana kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni</malay>

[ah] volunteer next week [lah] <malay>dia</malay> start <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia buat</malay> but [ah] like I told you [lah] we we started with the orientation online because <malay>sekarang</malay> we are still in the phase
two so according to ministry of health (uh) we cannot have face to face interaction with (um)
the patients [lah] the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
copyright copyrighting <malay>untuk</malay> (uh) <malay>tak tahu</malay> <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> social media <malay>punya</malay> page [lah]
so ya [lah] that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
<malay>tak pergi mana-mana</malay> [lah] this is online because right now we are still in phase two (um) so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society <malay>punya</malay> volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines <malay>sekarang</malay> (uh) because people you know cannot meet
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online <malay>sedih engkau kau tengok</malay>
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was (um) they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
(ugh) so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good (um)
so I mean there are different things that we
can do [lah] <malay>macam</malay> so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for <malay>macam</malay> design (uh) photography
(uh) they have <malay>macam</malay> a knitting crochet with the patients but <malay>sekarang takde</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you know it's it's (uh) only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things [ah] cancer society they've been around for a long time <malay>jadi</malay> so they they're very established in the community
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined (um)
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously <malay>susah</malay>
(um) but they tried (uh) I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is (uh) the <malay>apa tu nama dia</malay> awareness (uh) campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these <malay>macam cakap cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
(uh) <malay>ramai orang macam takut nak buat</malay> cancer screening because of course <malay>takut</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> people <malay>takut nak buat</malay> cancer screening
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot [lah] ya so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya I'm looking
forward to it [lah] honestly something I've been wanting to do for a <malay>macam dah lama gitu</malay> so (uh) ya #inshaallah# I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
you think so
no next week they will give me the (um) they have something in mind I think (uh) ya and then <malay>macam</malay> I'll just
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kalau boleh tolong</malay> then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
(uh) but of course they ask that [eh] no <malay>kalau</malay> once you commit you have to do it [ah] <malay>bukan macam suka-suka macam</malay> this week <malay>buat</malay> next week <malay>tak nak buat</malay> ya
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
you know next year when they start doing (uh) the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year <malay>bila</malay>
[oh] that's very soon
okay so what they do is on the form in (uh) <malay>apa apa tu</malay> during the four main religious group <malay>punya</malay> holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
<malay>hari raya dengan</malay> like #deepavali#
I think now <malay>dia tak buat apa-apa</malay> [lah] this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have (uh) all volunteers come together and <malay>kita macam</malay> pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have #ang pao#
[ah] so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff (um) and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families (um) with their expenses
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> afford treatment and then <malay>balik rumah rumah macam gitu</malay> and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them (um) like grants and and you know money like contributions (uh) so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year <malay>orang datang</malay> like people have to come to them to collect the #ang pao# (um) but this may be depending on (uh) whether or not phase three starts next year [lah] (um) I don't know whether that's going to happen <malay>ke tak</malay> ya so that's next year
<malay>kalau tidak</malay> boring <malay>aje</malay> [kan] <malay>buat</malay> remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
next year [lah] next year when we can
ya why not <malay>kenapa tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kau ingat aku apa</malay>
<malay>kau ingat aku apa</malay>
[oh] ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the (uh) programs where volunteers <malay>kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah</malay> [tau]
so
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean <malay>macam banyak macam</malay> program program [lah] you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya (um) ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then <malay>balik</malay> they are both
too <malay>penat</malay> (uh) the but (um) <malay>macam</malay> especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
<malay>kemaskan rumah</malay> they showed like one house <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kesian</malay> [lah] I <malay>tengokkan</malay> like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
(um) they bring in
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just <malay>makanan bawa pergi rumah dia</malay>
and stuff like that [lah] so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have <malay>macam apa tu</malay> volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
[a'ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
ya
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract <malay>untuk apa</malay> [kan] and it's really up to you
so
(mm)
but <malay>buat apa ni</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but but wait the dogs <malay>dari mana</malay>
the dogs <malay>kat mana</malay>
okay okay okay now I understand
[ah]
(mm)
the one <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>dekat</malay> ya that's true
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm) ya okay
(mm)
<malay>ini</malay> because of the (uh) <malay>apa ni benda ni</malay> [ah]
even with the <malay>ini</malay> the dogs and the cats

okay
(mm)
newborn okay newborn cats [jer] [lah]
<malay>lepas tu dia orang kasih duit tak</malay>
so when you say volunteer with doing this <malay>maknanya</malay> you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you <malay>bayar untuk semua bende ni semua</malay>
like for everything
(mm)
has a clinic
okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
so who pays for <malay>punya</malay> clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
so only only donations from from people from the public
!wow!
!wow! that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up <malay>macam sekarang dah macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>duit sikit gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] okay ya
(mm)
G O V <malay>ni apa</malay>
what is the <malay>nama</malay> [oh] okay
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] charity [lah] I mean they don't expect the government <malay>nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit</malay> government gets the money <malay>dari kita</malay> taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the <malay>orang-orang</malay>
<malay>apa masalah</malay> if you if the government don't have enough money to <malay>macam apa tu cakap</malay>
like (uh)
to give <malay>macam</malay> to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of <malay>kasih anjing-anjing</malay>
<malay>apa punya</malay> development
property development (uh)
<malay>mana kita ada</malay> jungle what we don't have any jungle
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
so what does have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
but do you all know you know as volunteers of (uh) and working in this working in this (uh) <malay>apa tu dia</malay> sector does the government actually have a plan (uh) when when <malay>macam</malay> like they go now <malay>kat belakang ni</malay> like there's this
<malay>tengah tengah</malay> this new development <malay>kat tengah kat belakang sini</malay>
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a <malay>macam apa tu cakap</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> contingency [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> plan [lah] like a plan when they develop these new lands
that they know
all these (uh) animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
but they've been developing singapore for how long <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam sampai sekarang tak tahu</malay>
(mm) #pasir ris# <malay>pun ada babi</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
but how can it be <malay>macam gini</malay> like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if <malay>macam kita baru</malay> start <malay>nak</malay> develop lands or takeover lands it's been <malay>macam</malay> we've been we've been building
and and other housing since <malay>bila kita punya</malay> independence nineteen sixties [ah]
(mm)

who takes care who is supposed to because <malay>kat sini</malay> I've seen <malay>satu</malay> just one snake and
<malay>apa</malay> ACRES
hello this is art [ah] by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a (um) a a young and
really up and coming artist and
he's a syrian refugee <malay>dia tinggal dekat</malay> lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways [ah] <malay>cakap macam gitu</malay>
so no honestly (uh) <malay>apa cakap ular-ular</malay>
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
it's not as easy as [oh] <malay>nampak anjing</malay> [oh] (uh) <malay>nampak babi</malay> we can see it we can you know some kind of action the <malay>ular ni</malay> you know <malay>macam kat bawah-bawah</malay> and then in the <malay>longkang-longkang</malay> you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but [eh] <malay>takut</malay>
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
(uh) snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about (uh) <malay>ular macam ular</malay> coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen <malay>satu kat sini</malay>
and and then <malay>dia macam masuk dalam longkang</malay> and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to <malay>macam takut</malay> (uh) because I can't I <malay>betul betul</malay> there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards <malay>tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh</malay> so
so the thing is <malay>dekat</malay> here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the (um) the stray dogs there is a family of three <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
the lorries ya so there's
one auntie <malay>dia</malay> (um) auntie <malay>tinggal kat tak tahu</malay> block <malay>mana</malay> she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that (uh) <malay>dulu dia kena saman</malay> because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about <malay>macam</malay> people feeding (uh) stray cats or stray dogs but auntie <malay>ni</malay> sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food <malay>untuk</malay> she feeds a lot of stray cats <malay>macam</malay> she brings <malay>macam besar</malay> you know <malay>macam orang-orang macam ini</malay> (um)
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting (um) for <malay>dia dia cakap dia kena</malay>
<malay>kena saman</malay> so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
!huh!
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie <malay>sekarang pun nak kena</malay> she has to be careful because she also puts out (uh)
(uh)
<malay>air untuk kucing-kucing ni</malay> so the problem is our area <malay>kat sini</malay> is a high dengue area
[ah]
<malay>tu apa</malay>
[oh] okay
(mm)
what do you mean two hours to clear <malay>siapa yang pergi</malay> check
<malay>siapa yang nak</malay> catch
what do you mean walk past <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> fine <malay>tak boleh</malay> feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours <malay>ni</malay>
how do they know <malay>macam</malay> who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
(um) <malay>tapi kau duduk situ</malay> so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
(mm) okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>mesti</malay> clear [lah]
<malay>tapi dia</malay> the feeder <malay>mesti</malay> clear <malay>makanan tu</malay>
[oh]
[ah] because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> ya that's true
<malay>lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia</malay> how much is the <malay>saman</malay>
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
[oh] I didn't know that
[oh]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>mana ada kat sini</malay> signs
who puts up these these signs
[oh] say
(mm)
ya but the the cats <malay>kat sini bagus juga</malay> [lah] and honestly the cats around here <malay>gemuk-gemuk</malay> because of <malay>macam</malay> auntie <malay>macam gini</malay> and this
[eh] <malay>apa kat belakang ni</malay> there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same <malay>kat sini</malay> so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute <malay>nama dia</malay> sausage <malay>aku kasih nama</malay> [jer] [lah] so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
<malay>sampai</malay> (uh) auntie <malay>kat bawah ni</malay> you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window (um) I can see someone else coming there's another man <malay>kat dia tinggal kat</malay> I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage <malay>ni</malay> honestly I've never seen stray cats
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
I mean (uh) <malay>macam</malay> the the
size <malay>tu macam</malay> comparable to a domestic cat like a cat <malay>punya kat kat rumah orang</malay> ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of <malay>kat sini</malay> I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
have run away <malay>dulu</malay> we used to see more of the dogs
(uh) during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because <malay>takde orang keluar</malay> [kan]
so I saw them <malay>dia selalu tidur</malay> under the this lorry because <malay>orang pun tak kerja</malay> so they were like always sleeping the three of them
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the <malay>kucing</malay> but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one <malay>betul</malay> I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore (uh) <malay>anjing tak dah takde lagi</malay>
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had <malay>kat depan ni</malay> right in front here there's these two big palm trees [kan] so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood <malay>macam</malay> this (um) once or twice we've seen them along the <malay>macam apa tu</malay> the park connector here at #bukit batok# going up to #clementi# but they came here the whole there were like there first of all <malay>dia hantar satu agaknya macam</malay> scout came scout <malay>nampak pokok ni</malay> scout stayed there so I took <malay>gambar</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan</malay> camera <malay>tu</malay> and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the <malay>apa ni</malay> I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was <malay>dekat apa jalan dekat</malay> park connector <malay>tu</malay> I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big <malay>longkang</malay>
they are so you see <malay>kat sana ada</malay> the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is <malay>keluar pergi</malay>
<malay>jalan</malay> you know everybody suddenly everybody <malay>pergi</malay> (uh) exercise so in that <malay>apa tu nama dia longkang</malay> the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore (uh) even
the animals crossing the path <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while (um) ya
it's just the regular birds the #minahs# the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
(uh) but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop (um) and they would do their swimming swimming but <malay>tu macam</malay> exhibitionist [tau] the otters are huge exhibitionists
yes
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the <malay>longkang</malay> where did they go to the (uh) the botanic garden
so they came out <malay>macam</malay> every night
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens [kan] not like before
(hmm)
(mm)
<malay>kesian</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but they're not the ones <malay>yang kat dalam longkang ni</malay> they're not that big <malay>dekat sini kat</malay> park connector the one that goes up to #pandan#
like different kinds of otters
<malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>jangan bedek</malay> [lah] <malay>kau cakap</malay> different family different types [lah]
what do you mean <malay>mana ada</malay> clan
<malay>macam apa</malay> clan
okay
[eh] <malay>kau jangan tipu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana boleh gini</malay>
what is that what fan club
[eh] <malay>kau macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau jangan bedek</malay> [lah] I mean sorry this is not
this is this sounds too
like on the ground <malay>macam</malay> they go and <malay>macam nak nak pergi cari</malay>
[ah] okay like like the people who go #sungei buloh# <malay>cari burung cari burung</malay> [ah] okay okay okay
but they all look the same <malay>apa macam mana nak ada</malay> divide
so the one <malay>yang</malay> that I say <malay>kat sini</malay>
they're so cute they really are very cute
during the circuit breaker [kan] so I read about the one <malay>yang</malay>
the ones that went to #serangoon# road
(uh) ya
so do they <malay>macam pindah</malay> from one place to another or when you say <malay>dia orang macam</malay> this otter clan #kallang# clan do they just live there <malay>atau macam</malay>
they come <malay>kat sini</malay> to look for the
#bukit batok# clan what what I honestly don't understand <malay>macam mana ni</malay>
<malay>lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana</malay> of course you have to look for <malay>orang lain</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm)
sausage sausage
<malay>lepas tu bila nak kahwin macam mana</malay>
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(mm)
I didn't know about that
<malay>lepas tu sekarang macam mana</malay> where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so <malay>macam</malay> do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and <malay>dia orang macam</malay> what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
is do they like
<malay>macam</malay> during the circuit breaker <malay>macam</malay> okay so that one whole family <malay>keluar pergi</malay> #serangoon# road <malay>nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa</malay> [eh] when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just <malay>macam duduk kat situ aje</malay>
[ah] okay
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes <malay>kat sini</malay> in the drain
how did the otters from <malay>macam</malay> botanic gardens <malay>pergi</malay>
<malay>kat sini</malay> like #bukit batok# because there is a whole we we see a lot in #bukit batok# at the park connector in the <malay>longkang</malay>
how do they
#serangoon#
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
like do they get tagged by <malay>apanya nama dia</malay> ACRES
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about <malay>macam</malay> on social media <malay>pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk</malay> all the otters knew there was once <malay>kat</malay> #clementi# (uh) near sixth avenue that big <malay>longkang</malay>
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the <malay>apa longkang besar</malay>
(um) but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it <malay>macam</malay> a new development that they came from somewhere
<malay>kau nak pergi mana lepas tu</malay>
[oh] okay
[eh] <malay>kau jangan bawa</malay> telephone <malay>kau masuk</malay> toilet <malay>boleh nanti orang dengar</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> can you please not <malay>macam gini</malay> this <malay>lucah</malay> can you please close the door
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
(mm)
so ya that's what I'm saying because <malay>dulu</malay> I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya [lah] wildlife ya [lah] of course aware but <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] what I'm saying is <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> honestly I mean I grew up in <malay>kampung</malay> we did not hear about all these otters during <malay>kampung dulu kampung banyak benda</malay> of course we had the <malay>monyet</malay> we actually had the <malay>monyet</malay> (uh) then
snakes of course
(um) we had our chickens and
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in <malay>kampung</malay> but we had the big <malay>longkang-longkang</malay>
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
so <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the <malay>macam</malay> the public's consciousness
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
okay that's new to me
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged <malay>macam apa tu namanya</malay> microchipped
(mm) (mm)
do they no I mean when you say they care for them <malay>bukan macam</malay> it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at <malay>macam</malay> you can't walk the otter
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves [kan]
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>tengok burung-burung</malay>
in singapore do they have them <malay>macam untuk ular-ular</malay>
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore [kan] I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at <malay>macam</malay> just hiding away and going into the <malay>longkang</malay>
(mm)
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
(mm)
[ah]
but how do you <malay>macam</malay> if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the <malay>longkang</malay> then it just disappears
[oh] I I remember <malay>dulu dekat</malay> the the <malay>kat mana tu</malay> I don't know what [lah] it was in the news was it a python
I remember this a few months ago was it a cobra or a python or something
!huh!
what
the snake ate the cat
<malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay>
so what happens when ACRES comes when <malay>apa</malay> the the snake now it has the
<malay>kucing</malay> the <malay>kucing</malay> is in the <malay>perut</malay>
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else [kan] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> redhill <malay>kat bawah</malay> block <malay>tak</malay> [kan] you you can't just leave it there
but but
but now we have less and less
so [a'ah]

popeyes okay [lah] for popeyes
<malay>ayam dia</malay>
not that not that crunchy right compared to but still very nice especially the <malay>kentang</malay> the whipped potato
popeyes with potato whereas whipped potato was not that
okay [lah] <malay>tak tak sedap sangat</malay> [ah] to my taste
okay [lah] both I think preference wise I <malay>tak</malay> choosy [ah] both
<malay>sedap</malay> very crunchy very nice I think it depends on your mood <malay>hari tu kalau</malay> you <malay>rasa</malay> your taste
you want something spicy I
think
popeyes is good is very crunchy but both is again suit to different people's taste [ah]
[ah]

<malay>ye</malay> [lah]
I don't mind <malay>berselerak</malay> sometimes but
because
<malay>diri kau sendiri</malay> [lah]
I know [lah] it's good but you see [ah] I'm I'm dealing with different cases already <malay>macam kau aku rasa</malay> ian is very well behaved
ya [lah] it's a different phase but I'm reaching that
ya I'm I'm I'm ya I'm so is like
ya correct so he is a different mature phase already secondary school
I have all the phases that's the problem that's why I <malay>aku macam</malay> stressed because I have one boy I have one [eh] actually [ah] this conversation do we need to speak #singlish# or not
<malay>no need</malay> [eh] nevermind [ah]
<malay>asalkan ada dua-dua</malay> [lah] mixed
#hairi# <malay>dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang</malay> and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay I have #aira# who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
[ah]
what's that word [ah] period [ah] she puberty she might she might be getting her period soon
hopefully soon <malay>belum</malay> [seh] she ask she ask me you know <malay>ibu</malay> when am I going to get my period five already primary six
[dey] <malay>kau</malay> sec one [eh] sec two <malay>ke</malay> sec one I know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes [lah] <malay>aku</malay> primary three

<malay>dia dia dia aku punya</malay> marker <malay>dia kalau dah</malay> start <malay>dah</malay> start [kan] chocolate [lah] [ah] that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya I think so <malay>dia aku punya</malay> marker every month
<malay>nanti kadang-kadang dia</malay> mood swing <malay>aku tak</malay> mood swing <malay>aku</malay> okay [jer] <malay>lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku</malay> are you going to get your period [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> after that I'll get it [lah] he's my marker first then after that I will get it <malay>nanti dia</malay> okay <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] ya but but after that will be [ah] <malay>ye sejiwa</malay> [lah] <malay>sangat</malay> ya I think we sync already

<malay>takde</malay> there's no way [lah] I the only way is for me to lazy parenting [lah] the robot I have I have it no it works the thing is <malay>aku</malay>
we were observing the robot [tau] <malay>kita cakap kesian</malay> robot <malay>ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena</malay> manoeuvre <malay>macam kalau aku jadi</malay> robot [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> like !alamak! <malay>meja</malay> !alamak! <malay>ada</malay> child <malay>punya benda</malay> !alamak! <malay>mainan</malay> no and and that's how <malay>dia macam macam</malay> confused [ah] so the best the best thing [ah] when I was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy I do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
<malay>kita beli</malay> second hand <malay>aku punya benda takde</malay> [lah] first hand <malay>semua</malay> second hand
<malay>kita beli daripada orang</malay>
!hais! when will I have humans who can help me at home
ya that's what I do [lah] I do lazy parenting
I called it lazy parenting [lah] I just order them about <malay>macam</malay> #ayra# <malay>sekarang dia dah pandai</malay>
<malay>belakang</malay> [a'ah] [lah]
<malay>dah lama apa baru sekarang kau perasan dah lama</malay>
<malay>kelabu asap</malay> ya granite
actually <malay>rumah aku dah dah takde</malay> is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all <malay>dah</malay> no [ah] the island I push there already because I don't I don't bake any more [mah] ya ya <malay>pasal aku dah tak</malay> bake <malay>jadi aku letak</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tolak ke tepi dulu</malay> so I have space to move around in the kitchen
then how <malay>yang tu kau tak pergi yang</malay> block two one eight <malay>tu</malay> why <malay>jauh daripada apa</malay>
there is a bus that goes to #kranji# [what]
I think so ya because sometimes (err) <malay>aku punya</malay> neighbour <malay>ni dia sekolah dekat</malay> #kranji# <malay>juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik</malay> three zero seven <malay>dia ambil lagi satu</malay> bus and then it drop behind <malay>aku tak tahu</malay>
ya you have to come back here [ah]
<malay>rumah</malay> #jannah#
[orh] the that's a new ya I do not know what is the
I do not know what is it
<malay>aku nampak rumah orang</malay> [jer] view <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
or
<malay>tu rumah baru apa</malay>
cause <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>rumah-rumah yang baru</malay> [kan] the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing <malay>aku macam</malay> like ya exactly <malay>pasal tu pasal</malay> we say resale the best that's why resale <malay>punya</malay> prices is still
three hundred
(mm)
(hmm)
no [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> that time <malay>aku tanya</malay> [ah] #naz# <malay>rumah aku punya</malay> two years two years ya
ya means <malay>kalau dah naik</malay> market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
<malay>jauh</malay> [ah] <malay>aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus</malay> [tau] cause of a southview <malay>kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak</malay> block <malay>sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang</malay> block <malay>sana</malay> block <malay>mak mertua aku</malay> block <malay>sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya</malay> block <malay>macam</malay> block <malay>aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada</malay> <malay>dengan</malay> yes correct then <malay>yang kat hujung-hujung</malay> is <malay>ada tapi mahal</malay>
ya this location quite difficult that time <malay>ada yang</malay> block opposite opposite my house block two zero four <malay>dia jual dia punya</malay>
then <malay>dia jual murah</malay> because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it [lah] since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later <malay>gila nasib baik</malay> ya I was thinking of that [ah]
ya I was thinking you know like [eh] this is the best time you know <malay>yang</malay> let's just do it [lah] <malay>nanti kita boleh fikir</malay> cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my [what]
not not not tapping into his so okay <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dia bayar dia punya</malay> part is <malay>lapan ratus aku punya</malay> part <malay>lima ratus</malay>
(hmm) but <malay>kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena</malay> increase but then again you'll be difficult [lah] cause if I prolong like this no job no contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser <malay>bila aku nak itu</malay>
so it's gonna be difficult [lah] so lucky thing also [lah] we never go cause now I'm rethinking twice do I really want an do we really need an is like a lot of space
and a lot of space to clean up
so
ya I will need the space [ah] but at this moment I try to
!chey! <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>kejap</malay> [jer] then <malay>lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak</malay>
<malay>tak aku aku nak</malay> need bigger space but then <malay>aku pun fikir</malay> bigger space means we probably buy more things
you know so
just be happy [jer] [lah] <malay>dengan apa dengan</malay> space <malay>yang aku ada</malay> because most of the time <malay>pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik</malay>
kitchen
(mmhmm) correct
three is just enough in in in <malay>apa</malay> in the end <malay>pun kita</malay> plan at this moment [ah] because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
#aira# <malay>yang tu yang tak</malay> she volunteered she say nevermind #hafis# sleep with me
(hmm) because <malay>dia sorang</malay> [jer] <malay>apa yang</malay> she gets everything [what] her own her own like double girls [lah] [ah] but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far (hmm) that's why she don't mind that #hafis# sleep with her
which
they are all sleeping together still <malay>tilam tilam kau tu</malay> very useful <malay>bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal</malay>
no #aira# has her own platform
so she sleep on her own <malay>tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam</malay>
ya in a way [lah] so <malay>gasak korang</malay> [lor]
<malay>tu dah</malay> start <malay>nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne</malay>

ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
why the <malay>sewa murah</malay>
[ah]
[ah] okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
(mm)
okay
but you can cook [what]
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
(uh) good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
(mm)
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
<malay>makan</malay> hotdog <malay>pun dah marah</malay>
in school <malay>setiap kali</malay> I bring back food then you <malay>marah</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm) okay
okay
can so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
<malay>itu sahaja</malay> I'm not gonna I'm not gonna explain or elaborate on my three wishes
it's okay I'll ask the second question
(um)
(err)
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
(mm)
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
<malay>dekat</malay> cafe #bedok# cafe <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok#
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
(mm)
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
(mm)
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
(uh huh) paddy field
swan
no not flamingo

(uh) that means <malay>kau suka</malay> [lah] <malay>kau akan cuba sahaja</malay> [kan] <malay>makanan</malay>
don't have courage to try new things
<malay>sebab itu kita selalu bila pergi</malay> india <malay>pergi tempat sama sahaja</malay> [eh] <malay>tak pergi keluar pergi mana-mana</malay>
if I give you <malay>arnab</malay>

don't take back on your promise [ah]
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
[oh]
okay
(uh huh)
okay do you have any
(mm)
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar [lah]
then you did did you watch incredibles two
(mm)
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
(mm) <malay>entah aku pun tak tahu</malay> I think twenty twenty three maybe
or maybe <malay>mungkin tahun depan</malay>
ya or maybe <malay>tahun depan</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
then the storyline
or <malay>kau tak ingat</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
(mmhmm) okay
then
<malay>kau ada tengok ke</malay>
<malay>kau ada tengok ke aku tak pernah nampak engkau tengok pun</malay>
which superhero movies have you watched
[oh] <malay>yang hari itu aku bawa kau tengok</malay> [kan]
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
but <malay>dia tua</malay> [kan] <malay>kau suka</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
then
so if you were to
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
<malay>yang dekat</malay>
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for (err) (err) single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal [lah] his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
and <malay>yang</malay> help them
plan out their
master (err) their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no [lah] professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research [what] like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it [lah] and
<malay>tengok kalau dia ada apa-apa nak nasihat nak bagi ke atau apa-apa</malay> then
ya then I'll decide then I also need to ask him about exchange about internship opportunities <malay>itu semua aku nak tanya nak</malay> settle
ya
ya <malay>hari isnin nak pergi</malay> then
probably <malay>jumaat balik</malay>
ya but (err) <malay>isnin isnin</malay> I meet my mentor then <malay>hari selasa aku ada</malay> event
in school
then wednesday
wednesday <malay>aku ada apa-apa tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but probably I come back either on thursday or friday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing [lah] because many of my friends
they
<malay>macam dia orang</malay> complain [lah] <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay>
<malay>tak suka apa yang dia orang buat</malay> then which makes it very difficult
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different [what]
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
A level <malay>mana ada</malay> civil
you mean from my
no <malay>tak ada</malay> as in I
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different (err)
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
it's a fifty fifty thing [lah] <malay>ada orang suka ada orang tak suka</malay>
then <malay>yang tak suka itu dia orang</malay> struggle
then <malay>yang suka</malay> they they will thrive [lah] so fortunately for me I
I like what I'm doing
(mm)
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education [what]
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
ya they talk they <malay>cakap apa itu</malay> they all said something about how they send their students overseas for like a short period of time to study overseas and all that <malay>itu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> that's why like I said monday I'm gonna go and talk to my profs to find out more information
also
and it's important to start early [lah] because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also [mah]
then <malay>cepat-cepat datang</malay> then I <malay>dapat</malay> my
degree <malay>cepat-cepat habis</malay> my masters or
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I I really like teaching
[eh] teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
!huh! go
after I graduate go
go <malay>belajar beberapa tahun</malay> then
<malay>aku ajar dekat</malay> primary school
okay <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing [lah] and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau selalu duduk rumah sahaja</malay>
okay
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh]
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
<malay>percuma</malay>
anything [lah] ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
okay
okay
okay
(mm) actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
<malay>yang macam kau cakap demam ke</malay>
or the <malay>selesema</malay>
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
like <malay>macam demam ke selesema itu semua</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then
<malay>lagi apa</malay>
so
if
<malay>kalau</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> master three new skills what would they be
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
<malay>dekat mana</malay>
okay right
<malay>jauhnya</malay>
#yio chu kang# all the way

if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your #mee hoon#
the the the dry #mee hoon#
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet #mee hoon#
<malay>yang basah punya</malay> I <malay>tak boleh makan</malay>
<malay>tak sedap</malay>
okay
(hmm)
so

I don't know I couldn't taste the smoky flavour or anything

I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know [lah] (mm) (mm) is to cater to people
as in <malay>kalau kau makan satu</malay> pizza <malay>sama rasa bosan apa</malay>
so things to let people
have a bit more variety [lah]
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza (uh)
<malay>kalau aku yang tadi aku pergi jumpa</malay>

(mm)
<malay>tengok tengok tengok besok</malay> we will see tomorrow
ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring (um) rice we can bring prep rice cooker
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>pernah dengar</malay> I've heard of it before is it is electricity powered right
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can (uh) I think you just bring to the room and
ya
ya I I I've seen it before someone cook like <malay>macam</malay> beef rose
or stew
<malay>berapa itu</malay>
ya no [lah] it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more [what]
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back [what]
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say [what] monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
<malay>kena tengok</malay>
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months [what] it's just one semester six months
[oh] [eh] not six months [lah] three months of school
so
january to april but which is <malay>kalau aku pergi dekat</malay> january on in january right then I finish school in april I can extend my stay there [what]
no school (uh) just come back (uh) three months later
ya
yes and then <malay>kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan</malay> [kan]
she's working in [what]
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
(mm) so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies [lah]
so ya she already graduated [what] she she no no and then
ya different <malay>dia tak ada</malay> then three years her course was just three years
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working [lah] and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
<malay>dia punya bapak beli untuk dia</malay>
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that [lah] to make money
ya
so <malay>dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana</malay>
ya [kan] just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland [ah]
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
india <malay>pun ada</malay> north india
<malay>tak nak malas</malay> because very expensive [what]
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature [what]
it's more it's less
(uh) that one <malay>aku dah</malay> check <malay>semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil</malay>
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries [what]
and then <malay>bawah itu ada</malay> spain I think <malay>semua</malay>
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
(uh) but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
(uh huh)
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you [eh] school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
so <malay>pergi</malay> or I or I <malay>pergi</malay>
no I don't want go [ah]
<malay>ada orang kita tahu ke</malay> do we know anyone in the
we don't have relatives there
<malay>siapa</malay>
I don't know I think it's something related to
related
ya okay
okay
(mm) okay

ya
different things to do [ah]
ya
too tired
<malay>betul betul</malay>
[eh]
feed her feed her
(mm)
(mm)
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
[kan]
ya ya ya the also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the (uh) volunteers right so <malay>aku</malay> my my my volunteering with them is really fostering [ah] so I'm a rather than you know (uh)
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
(err) and then
it's a shelter the dogs are in [kan] [kan] is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what <malay>tengah</malay> ya <malay>tengah</malay> ya we are very close it's it's just next to #choa chu kang# ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter (uh) that involves dog walking
(err) cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then (uh) there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like <malay>macam</malay> they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this (uh) (uh) at this (uh) area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam orang lalu-lalang</malay> [kan] then you <malay>macam</malay> talk about the awareness <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] which I wouldn't mind doing actually (uh) <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> (uh) we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that [lah] for being like you said [lah] because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> only you and the dogs <malay>tapi macam</malay> public all this awareness sort of stuff (uh) no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get (uh) emails <malay>pasal</malay> unit unit ambassadors and all that <malay>tapi</malay> now no more
ambassadors <malay>macam</malay> you you you <malay>macam</malay> you at the booth and you wear <malay>punya</malay> t-shirt (uh) you're next to the merchandise <malay>punya</malay> table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations <malay>punya</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) tin <malay>tu</malay> [kan] and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do (uh) this is what we do as an and these are the cases <malay>macam gitu</malay> awareness of (uh) what does and how they can help [oh] they also have social (uh) pre-corporate social responsibility <malay>punya</malay> programs companies <malay>punya tu</malay>
so then you can do that (uh) they can say [oh] we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer <malay>ada</malay> volunteer <malay>macam</malay> photography
<malay>macam</malay> to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the <malay>gambar-gambar</malay> for the calendars so regular they need (uh) you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot [lah] I'm one of them
<malay>anjing kucing</malay>
which I'm fostering for <malay>kucing</malay> I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
fosterer for puppies <malay>macam gitu</malay> so when they have cases then they contact you say okay #wati# we have this then
ya no [lah] fosterer no
what
ya (uh) yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic [ah] they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say [oh] the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say [eh] your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay [lor]
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the (uh) but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
exactly <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
you know [lah] [kan] international [kan] [kan] <malay>nama</malay> international <malay>punya</malay> brand [kan] so <malay>orang pun ada</malay> [lah] you know <malay>macam kasih</malay> donation <malay>gitu ada</malay> [lah] I think I guess they do have you know (uh)
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
(uh) but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad (uh) <malay>kita punya</malay> G O V <malay>takde kasih apa-apa</malay>
government
[ah] G O V
<malay>dia orang</malay> [eh] <malay>ini binatang-binatang kita orang</malay> [tau] <malay>daripada negeri ini mesti</malay> [lah] <malay>jaga sikit</malay>
[ah] that is the <malay>masalahnya tu</malay>
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish [lah] cannot be
[oh] I think must there has to be some (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not [lah] <malay>macam</malay> of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way [lah] you know [ah] in fact I was just talking about it to (uh) to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing [kan]
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas #bukit batok# [lah] <malay>banyak banyak macam</malay> jungle jungle <malay>apa</malay> they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know #bukit batok# has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the (uh) estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain (uh) authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out <malay></malay> you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
so and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean [kan] it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish [lah] what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
<malay>tengah</malay> (mm) (mm) (mm)
no they don't both okay
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out #punggol# #pasir ris# #choa chu kang# but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but <malay>takde</malay> collaboration <malay>kau faham tak takde</malay> supportive effort at all <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kau</malay> okay <malay>kita sekarang kita punya</malay> and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean <malay>kita nak buat macam gitu macam</malay> okay <malay>kita dia orang</malay> because <malay>dia orang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang boleh ambil</malay> I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and <malay>duit takde duit</malay> [kan] so <malay>siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu</malay> [kan] government [kan] so at least <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kita tolong</malay> collaborate [lah] you know (uh) okay (uh) <malay>kita buat ni</malay> then you all can (uh) <malay>kita boleh kasih kau orang</malay> support <malay>sikit-sikit untuk</malay> blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so <malay>apa yang buat sekarang</malay> is <malay>bila binatang ni keluar yang</malay> #gahmen# #gahmen# <malay>ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh</malay> it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya <malay>itu yang kita</malay> boring
I mean this this this look at
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> not to this extent not to this extent look at #tengah# now #tengah# <malay>baru</malay> #tengah# is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because #tengah# is still around correct #lim chu kang# <malay>sekarang semua nak</malay> development #punggol# <malay>mana ada</malay> #punggol# <malay>dulu dulu mana ada</malay> waterway #punggol# <malay>sekarang dah ada</malay> #punggol# <malay>apa</malay> all the dogs from #punggol# are coming out you can you can literally walk on #punggol# street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs <malay>dulu mana ada</malay> because #punggol# was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because !wah! dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
the wild boar <malay>pun sama</malay>
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in #pasir ris# why because #pasir ris# you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no #pasir ris# farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to #tengah# now they are all in #tengah# now the animal welfare groups so they are developing #pasir ris# that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible (uh) to all residents who are going to panic
<malay>betul</malay> exactly <malay>aku nak salahkan</malay> wild boar <malay>tu macam mana kesian pula</malay> so this is exactly what we are <malay>ini macam</malay> frustration [lah] [kan]
<malay>gatal</malay>
no <malay>gatal kau tengok aku punya ni</malay> rashes <malay>tapi aku memang</malay> sensitive skin
<malay>kau</malay> <malay>kulit kulit buaya</malay>
<malay>kau takde macam ni</malay> cover <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>ni</malay> [kan]
[ah]
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
<malay>abeh ada tulis</malay> arab [ah]
[oh] !wow!
[ah]
<malay>ni tak tak sangat</malay>
[oh] they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is (um) is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again (uh) so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute [kan]
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya !aww!
is it [oh] so sweet
ya
!aww! bless her !aww! ya
<malay>kena saman</malay> there's no such thing
I don't know about the <malay>saman</malay> part I know you that you <malay>kena saman</malay> if you litter
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue <malay>apa</malay>
national environmental agency they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment [lah]
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case happens to walk past then you #kena# fine [lah] or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
(uh) okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home [kan]
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear [lah] some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed <malay>makan makan makan</malay> [ah] <malay>dah habis</malay> okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they <malay>balik</malay> then <malay>patah balik dia orang patah balik</malay> then clear [lah]
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
<malay>kalau tidak</malay> it is considered littering
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough [lah] you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering [lah] I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
<malay>entah</malay> littering [lah] whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering [lah]

town councils town councils (um) cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign [lah] <malay>dekat kat</malay> lift landing you know (uh) please keep clear within two hours <malay>macam gitu macam</malay> posters

[ah]

ya
[ah]
ya
<malay>kesian</malay> [eh]
back to their refuge [lah]
away from all the <malay>orang-orang</malay>
ya [eh] <malay>masa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> what <malay>bila aku dekat</malay> (uh) botanic gardens <malay>aku kerja kat situ</malay> [oh] my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
[oh] they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them <malay>dia orang macam ada</malay> very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
people who work there know where these fellas go (uh) their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way [oh] then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
(uh) so funny and it's true right they would go almost every (uh) almost everyday
(uh) I guess because botanic gardens [kan] <malay>ada</malay> lakes [kan] <malay>ada</malay> lakes <malay>ada</malay> eco lake swan lake and all the <malay>macam</malay> the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where [ah] the drains [ah] does it go to I don't know (uh) so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but (uh) it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so (uh) when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so (uh) the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe <malay>macam ada</malay> bodyguard
(uh) so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules (uh) I guess you know the the otter felt safe [lah]
ya <malay>dah macam</malay> they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though [oh] my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
<malay>mana ada longkang</malay>
[oh]
you know there are a few families [ah] apparently
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families <malay>dia macam</malay> different clans
otter
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families <malay>macam</malay> different hello <malay>macam macam</malay> tigers [kan] lions [kan] <malay>ada</malay> different pride
<malay>sini ada</malay> so they have the #kallang# clan the #kallang# one which is like the the family that lives ya !alah! <malay>kau baca</malay> [lah] <malay>dalam surat khabar</malay> you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
there is a fan club [ah]
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
ya they are <malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] they <malay>macam</malay> the hobbies <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] yes they are watching the birds the [ah] okay yes <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so they have the okay only the otter fan club [lah]
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know [oh] this is the #kallang# clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
<malay>mana</malay> ya !alah! of course [lah] they look the same <malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang</malay> but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the #kallang# clan
(uh) so the #kallang# clan otters are the ones that hang out in the #kallang# area <malay>dia macam</malay> territorial [lah]
this is their territory [oh] then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not #kallang# so that is the one so they have different families [lah] all clans
maybe another clan !huh!
maybe they are another clan but then again you know <malay>yang dekat yang dekat</malay> #kallang# <malay>tu</malay> !wah! I tell you
(uh) or the ones <malay>yang pergi</malay> <malay>kau tak baca dia masuk kat</malay>
[ah] <malay>gitu dengan</malay> <malay>tu</malay> that one is one clan know
[ah] [ah] so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
ya [eh] <malay>dekat</malay> #bishan# park #bishan# park <malay>pun ada</malay> [tau]
I don't think they look for other clans
(um) when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say #kallang# clan is like is like this is their territory
you know <malay>macam</malay> they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks [ah] this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
(uh) this is their territory <malay>kau masuk dalam</malay> territory <malay>dia orang boleh bergaduh</malay>
I guess among themselves [lah] I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
<malay>dia orang bukan macam</malay> (um) some canines some felines <malay>yang</malay> after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook !aiyo! so sad [ah] I think that was one was near (uh)
(uh) one of the (um)
I think (uh) <malay>tempat</malay> fishing <malay>punya</malay> people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think #kallang# I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook <malay>mati</malay> [tau] so sad
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news [lah] okay so what I remember in the news
they <malay>macam</malay> they go to their <malay>mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana</malay> but they have their own spare trait [lah] <malay>kalau kau macam pergi dekat</malay> #kallang# river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
(um)
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove (um) they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far (um) the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts [lah]
one of their hangouts you know [ah]
ya ya ya
!wah! the otters right
cute right
ya (uh)
[eh] cute
to be honest <malay>aku tak ingat sejak bila</malay> when is the first time they came out but otters <malay>ni tapi</malay> (uh)
(uh) both <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) I don't know I don't know I don't remember when <malay>aku nak kencing</malay> I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly <malay>apa apasal aku</malay> toilet what do you mean I come back [lah]
ya <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] but I don't remember exactly when the otters (um)
(uh) I don't remember exactly when the otters you know <malay>keluar</malay> but definitely at least (uh) you know five years I think
<malay>bila bila aku</malay> start <malay>perasan ni</malay> [lah] when I first started you know noticed the news [ah] not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
<malay>masa kampung</malay> babe <malay>masa kampung-kampung dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada sungai-sungai</malay> otters <malay>nak pergi</malay> <malay>nak buat apa sekarang</malay> they're all where are they going to go
ya
<malay>sama</malay> [lah] <malay>sama</malay> [lah]
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove <malay>apa dekat</malay> #sungei buloh# <malay>tu</malay> [kan] so I guess they decided to <malay>jalan keluar jauh sikit</malay> [lor]
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing I don't think so no (uh) unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like (uh) in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say [oh] this the the the #kallang# clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like !wow! bloody hell how do they know I guess they know [lah] they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do (uh) they will do (um) <malay>macam</malay> awareness <malay>macam</malay> don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't <malay>apa apa</malay> you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context [lah] these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know [oh] they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group (uh) this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies [meh] ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is <malay>kau tahu macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> the ornithologist <malay>yang tengok-tengok</malay> observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know not the caretaking type [lah] but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the #ulars# maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay [lah] let's put it this way [lah] shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction [tau]
you know the otters in the city !wow! can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like !wow! what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like <malay>macam</malay> unlikely sight
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no [lah] they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
[ah] then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
ya <malay>mana</malay> ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently (uh) couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at <malay>entah</malay> #bukit merah# or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
ya all these com cats <malay>kat bawah</malay> it's the natural predator <malay>apa</malay> natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release [lah]
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already <malay>mati</malay> because of these the snake <malay>pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang</malay> snake <malay>tu yang</malay> snake <malay>tu tengah</malay> com cat <malay>dekat depan dekat mak</malay> news [ah] snake com cat [ah]

so one is for one dollar
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like <malay>macam</malay> you go to #jinjja# chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or [ah] it's that one [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like <malay>macam</malay> got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone [lah] got a lot of different flavour [ah] like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
we never go at there maybe we can go there [lor] check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces !wah! #shiok# [sia]
actually we can two person share one [what] one person six piece six dollars okay [sia] right

<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>mata tutup</malay> [ah] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> B B nine
(err) <malay>bukan bukan bukan</malay>
ya <malay>bukan</malay>
so okay <malay>kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni</malay> [eh] <malay>mari kita</malay>
[ah] <malay>nak cakap pasal orang tak</malay>
<malay>nak cakap tentang apa</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh gitu</malay> [eh]
<malay>orang kasih</malay> assignment <malay>kita mengumpat</malay>
okay okay ya alright <malay>kita jadi</malay> serious (um) <malay>apa kita nak berbual</malay> [eh] (um)
<malay>kita boleh cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita punya keluarga</malay> or okay no [lah] no [lah] [ah] shares [lah] stock market [lah] [eh]
so (um) you <malay>ada</malay> any investment you you <malay>dah buat ke</malay> or anything you <malay>nak</malay> recommend
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
me ya
I I also don't know [lah] I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
but I <malay>tak tahu</malay> because <malay>sekarang nak beli</malay> tesla <malay>mahal tak mampu</malay> though
so
I think <malay>kalau</malay> I I will <malay>beli</malay> the stock (uh) for what I have now [lah] my capital <malay>yang ada</malay> I would probably invest in cheaper stocks [lah] singapore based stocks like
(uh) old #chang kee# for example (err) <malay>murah</malay> [jer] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> old #chang kee# <malay>dia punya</malay> share price is (err) <malay>enam puluh satu sen saje</malay> [tau] [ah] serious [a'ah] <malay>betul tu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada macam seratus ke dua ratus</malay> dollar then you <malay>akan</malay>
hold a lot of shares [tau] so I think
<malay>berbaloi</malay> [lah] then I I I mean [ah] I was looking at their annual report then old #chang kee# [kan]
<malay>dia orang akan</malay> open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like <malay>macam</malay> the demand for asian foods are rising <malay>tapi</malay> supply <malay>tak banyak</malay>
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region [kan] then <malay>agaknya</malay> I would think [lah] it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like (um) they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend [lah] so I mean that's my thing [lah] cause <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't think I I <malay>boleh mampu</malay> [lah] tesla <malay>mahal saje</malay>
ya <malay>tapi itu</malay> my thing [lah] on stocks
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> some some stocks <malay>dia orang tak</malay> how to say <malay>dia orang tak syariah</malay> on client [tau] so <malay>nanti dia orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh ambil dia punya</malay> (um) benefits [lah] from that stocks so ya I don't know [lah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua</malay> islamic financial [ah] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it [lah] that time I went for this (uh) website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get <malay>syariah pampasan</malay> or not
so it's very interesting because <malay>macam</malay> they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's (uh) allowed or not <malay>haram</malay> or halal [lah] in that sense <malay>tapi</malay> the problem with that website [ah] they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you <malay>kena bayar</malay>
then I'm like !alamak! then you muslim <malay>pun nak buat duit</malay>
<malay>nak tengok</malay> stocks halal <malay>ke tak</malay>
but I would say it's good [lah] like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very <malay>macam</malay> you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay [lah] that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
ya I think <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>kita sekarang</malay> (err) I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive [lah]
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
so ya <malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay>
ya (um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
good <malay>tak</malay> stocks
(mm)
I see I see
ya anyway (err) <malay>betul tu</malay> ya but I heard [kan] <malay>itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak pakai wahed</malay> invest then
<malay>ada</malay> some fees involved right like <malay>apa tu</malay>
but how much [ah] the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
(mm)
ya ya
(um) okay <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nak bilang</malay> you [oh] ya anyway I I found out there is days
new (um) way
technically grow your money but with very low return [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you <malay>tak nak letak</malay> it in the bank [lah]
because firstly <malay>kalau</malay> you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the <malay>hibah tak banyak</malay>
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new <malay>saham</malay> returns <malay>tapi tak banyak</malay> the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> it's like a savings account with a little bit more (uh)
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
so
wasted [lah] I think like a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal
so
ya [lah] wasted <malay>kalau dia orang tak</malay> invest in bonds then <malay>kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam</malay> [seh] if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
right [kan]
can [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> I call <malay>dia orang</malay>
ya [lah] I call [lah] I call [lah] I <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay> right
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity [lah] because like you know (um)
[eh] not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward [lah] for
for the idea of islamic finance because technically (um) you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also <malay>macam</malay> in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
that's why I think (err)
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore <malay>macam</malay> not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
ya possibly because (um) even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
interest yielding accounts and maybe <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> [lah] it's <malay>haram</malay> because you would need to kind of know [mah] <malay>yang kita tak boleh yang</malay> interest and all bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya <malay>kita terus</malay> deep [eh] <malay>berbual</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> I was looking at (um) the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting [lah] because (uh) one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are (err) they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
(um) maybe there's one thing we can consider [lah]
so ya
SOCOE will be a good <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>pun macam tak faham sangat</malay> [lah] how how the SOCOE (um) investment works but halal [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] so <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [eh]
ya so
ya
[oh] <malay>kita punya</malay> trip [eh] [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I I <malay>punya adik kejap</malay> [eh] I call my <malay>adik</malay> hello
<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>baru kentut adik</malay> I <malay>kentut adik</malay> I <malay>lepas ni nak kena</malay>
<malay>bau dia kuat</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu dia punya ada</malay> like a mix of a and I don't know <malay>dia makan apa tapi bau dia</malay> like one kind you know toxic toxic
<malay>kentut</malay> [ah] I think maybe yes [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> eating [lah] agaknya rasa gitu</malay> [ah]
so (um)
ya ya <malay>itu</malay> I I I <malay>tu tak</malay> okay [ha] [ha] so anyway (um)
<malay>nak pergi makan</malay> I <malay>pun lapar sekarang belum makan</malay> so I <malay>pun nak pergi makan</malay> actually [kan] is #hafizah# going or not to #sedap# mania like what what do you think the chances are

I would think maybe #seletar# cafe will be good <malay>tapi sana makanan dia</malay> <malay>tak</malay> halal so <malay>mana kita boleh makan</malay> [oh] maybe we can eat at #seletar# airport the mister <malay>teh tarik</malay> express <malay>dia tu mahal ke</malay>
okay (um)
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> what are good things for us to <malay>makan</malay> [eh] (err)

<malay>nak</malay> find ideas [lah] want to like the social mission
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> so in singapore <malay>apa</malay> social mission you can solve
<malay>mana</malay> #boon keng# is it
at this block block block <malay>sebelas</malay> [eh]
<malay>ada yang sebelah</malay> main road <malay>tu yang</malay> you pass by <malay>satu</malay> block <malay>macam</malay> horizontal
[ah] block block <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak</malay> [eh] block <malay>tu ada dadah semua</malay> I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
I don't know [lah]
[oh] [oh] your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
[oh] distant [eh] <malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
[oh] okay okay
[oh]
<malay>nama dia</malay> Q
ya so <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>tahu ni</malay> Q <malay>tinggal kat</malay> #boon keng#
[oh]
<malay>takde bapa</malay>
I see I see ya I mean is is it because <malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> #boon keng# <malay>takde bapa ke tinggal</malay> #boon keng# <malay>pasal takde bapa</malay>
I I curious [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
[oh]
[oh] <malay>dengan datuk dia</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba letak datuk</malay>
<malay>contohnya apa khabar</malay> [eh] are you close with the <malay>datuk</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> doctor <malay>apa</malay> though
like !wah! so I mean not bad [eh] <malay>walaupun dia tinggal</malay> at risk block <malay>mak dia</malay> doctor
<malay>kencang</malay> [seh] then <malay>kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak</malay> take her out you know
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine [ah]
I I'm wondering (uh) honestly curious
[oh] interesting [eh] psychology
[ah] psychology you <malay>pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak</malay> I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
!wah!
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify [kan]
<malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay> very good
I actually now you speaking of which [ah] I think I met someone like this you know <malay>tak tahu orang sama ke</malay> this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the #boon keng# area then there was this doctor <malay>dan dia punya kucing</malay>
so I was like <malay>tapi dia tengah pakai</malay> white coat [lah] [eh] doctor <malay>dengan kucing</malay>
ya so maybe [lah] it's the it's the same person [lah] loves animal right
[ah] [a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> vet I mean we don't know [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> career <malay>banyak</malay>
a lot of careers ya
but I mean okay [lah] so <malay>maknya</malay> consider good [lah] doctor
good [lah] <malay>tapi anaknya</malay>
(um) I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I heard <malay>anak dia</malay>
[ah] I don't know how I heard [lah] where I heard [lah] <malay>agaknya kat</malay> mothership <malay>anak dia macam</malay>
<malay>apa seorang</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay> or rather act a bit <malay>pelik</malay> you know
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
maybe <malay>dia punya anak</malay> needs treatment [lah] like like do you think so
[oh] mother's gossip
[a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] however <malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul tu</malay> maybe what we can do is we can actually find this (um) Q your distant relative we can <malay>ajak</malay> her [lah] go <malay>makan</malay> [oh] maybe #sedap# mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
<malay>banyak banyak banyak banyak</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> so
<malay>lagi</malay> more reason [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
(uh) maybe we should help [lah] we should help please tell
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true [lah] if someone is put in that environment they kind of <malay>macam</malay> angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you <malay>takde</malay> you know outlet <malay>boleh keluarkan</malay> the <malay>perasaan</malay>
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally [lah] [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay> her [eh] I [tau] eat him or her up like internally
so (um) it's important [lah] to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized [lah] in
(mm) [ah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay>
[ah] ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday [lah]
[ah] #sentosa# is it
that's how [ah] we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
(um) #sentosa# I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump <malay>itu</malay> I <malay>tak berani</malay>
so (um) #sentosa# maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar [ah]
you know we can just hang around at #sentosa# #sentosa# I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts [lor]
[ah] yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort #serapong# can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
tramp <malay>punya</malay> trail then we just <malay>macam</malay>
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say [lah] they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
you cannot claim compensation [lah] because it's at your own risk [mah] you <malay>masuk tempat gitu</malay> so
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good [lah] cause <malay>kalau kalau tak</malay> then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
[oh] ya ya how much is it [ah]
I'm not too sure I really don't
[oh] ya we can do that also (uh) I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
(err) (um) can [lah] I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
can also then luge <malay>macam laju</malay> [lah] a bit too fast don't you think so

#stalisha#
my day today is very tiring obviously (um) it's been two days [ah] I sleep very late
<malay>dalam pukul enam pagi</malay>
because I started a business selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> yes
(um) and so far it's been well (um) it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring [lah]
basically because I like to eat <malay>tahu begedil</malay>
(um) quite recently [eh] [ah] like last month [ah] late last month when <malay>tahu begedil</malay> was was like a trend
(um) it's among the home-based sellers [lah]
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
(um) <malay>tahu begedil</malay> and they both
have their
<malay>apa tu macam ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya kesedapan tu</malay> [kan] ya
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
for a while because <malay>ibu</malay> force me to
but (um) making this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> of course I only started recently
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
(um) [eh] I mean there were no <malay>macam kedai</malay> taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
[ah] [ah]
customers [ah]
yes
delivery is
(um) by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya [ah] so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight [lah] hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
(um)
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
[ah] I have school I have (um) freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
so I think [ah] this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I will only sell <malay>bila ada</malay> time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> holidays
ya
go [ah] because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change [lah] because I like to bake also
so maybe like maybe the next week is not <malay>tahu begedil</malay> it's like
(um) brownies or cookies something like that
branding
[oh] I didn't call I didn't name it but <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> named it as
#tahbegs# #tahbegs#
ya it's #tahbegs# is from #tahu# and #begedil# but we make it very hipster
so it's #tahbegs#
ya T H B E G S
[oh] ya (um) I also own a small business selling #bawals#
<malay>bawal</malay> yes <malay>tudung bawal</malay> you know there's square scarf
[eh] it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be [eh] next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
(um) one is the our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk <malay>bawal</malay> and our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> it sells
(um) better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
[ah] because (um) me and my partner [lah]
ya we we
<malay>kita suka</malay> try <malay>benda</malay> like try to do things new things and we try to ya [lah]
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
we hustle a lot <malay>macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau hari-hari kerja</malay>
<malay>asalkan</malay> like <malay>kita boleh rasa duit tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] #inshallah# !wah! <malay>untuk</malay> [ah] <malay>benda yang halal</malay>
twenty one
that young
[oh]
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
that's the best you can sleep
[oh] okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
[oh] (mm) [ah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay
(uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
I you like wrapped
[oh] like <malay>mati macam melayu</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
[oh] my god
they didn't pay you
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] I see
(um)
what am I doing at nineteen
(um) I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
(um)
there was this
<malay>apa tu</malay> open casting for new models
and then (um) I was very camera shy last time
like <malay>tak suka ambil gambar</malay> and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a <malay>hijabi</malay> model
so I'm like [meh] like I I don't even bother [lah] but then my partner saw like [eh] you should try [lah] you just try then [orh]
I said no I don't want (err) I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the (um) the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
[ah] he applied to two [ah] company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
[ah] it was an unpaid job
for
(um) until I was maybe
(um) nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
(um)
by their apparel
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't <malay>simpan</malay> because the quality is like shit
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like (um) the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
and then I come back with just a piece of <malay>tudung</malay> for me it's like <malay>merepek</malay> so
(err) when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
<malay>ibu</malay> (um)
tell me [lah] like [oh] you need to start
(um) charging these people because you are having a lot of (um)
<malay>apa ni</malay> (um) shops coming to you (uh) for shooting she said then okay [lah] I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
and #alhamdulillah# it also went well
[ah]
people also come to me (um) to do to create <malay>apa</malay> to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
(um) sell their products [ah]
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
I don't know whatever <malay>barang</malay> that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried (uh) an influencer before to boost start my (um) Kamash (um) the <malay>tudung</malay> brand
(uh) and it didn't work [ah]
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because [ah] her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales [lah] so I was like okay (um) actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they (um) they really spread the word and tag you know
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
other companies ya
(mmhmm)
usually (um) before we post something right for the company we also like send the
<malay>apa tu</malay> our
what do they call it
okay [lah] the context [ah] the context of the post [ah] we
ya the description we always like (um) send it
to the company first let them approve <malay>apa-apa macam</malay> if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people [ah] <malay>macam tambah-tambah</malay> [lah] [ah] themselves and then they
then they send back to us then <malay>baru kita</malay> copy paste and then put
[ah] on our post
(uh) it's our post because we are like (um) ya
usually is like that
[ah] no that that's the thing that's why I don't (um) I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like (um) they told me [lah] like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
(um) is very difficult
(um) and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle [lah] but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school (um) there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson (um) end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night [lah] something like that
ya it's like it's very bad [lah] is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up (uh) my own company [ah]
selling clothes selling <malay>muslimah</malay> clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
(um)
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
!alamak! we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
(mm)
because all of this (um) of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
(um) creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well [lah] and
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] you need to do your research (err) do survey do prototype everything
(uh) (uh)
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
(um) sellers <malay>terdahulu biasa</malay> about <malay>apa yang dorang suka</malay> instead of what
their customers like
you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay> they
assume that [orh] <malay>aku suka ni</malay> so confirm <malay>orang lain akan suka</malay>
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face [lah] when I'm opening this (um) Kamash
<malay>pasal</malay> (um) a lot of people say [eh] <malay>ni lawa</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> but we cannot hear what our family members really (um) say we need to reach out to people
(um)
yes
and
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum [ah] she said like [orh] <malay>ni</malay> colour <malay>cantik</malay> everything whatever shit
but then actually <malay>salah</malay> [ah] it's not selling our first
out first what [ah] [ah]
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
simple <malay>macam</malay> not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful <malay>tapi</malay> a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like [eh] [eh] <malay>ni mana ada orang pakai</malay> cotton <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> but it sell out like a lot (um) we bought I'm ten colours
eight colours already sold out
ya
[ah] we manufacture ourself
[ah] no (uh) we liaise with a factory in #jakarta#
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
(mm)
no [lah] I mean like obviously (uh) when you grow up
[eh]
[ah] my god okay it needs to switch
naturally (um)
<malay>bila dah membesar</malay> right <malay>sambil membesar</malay>
ya <malay>sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar</malay> [tau] <malay>apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka</malay>
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then <malay>ibu tak suka</malay> so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
(um) she said [oh] you know (um) <malay>macam</malay> she tell told me all the negative things [lah] all the
cons about being a nurse
and then [ah]
it's like <malay>jaga mayat</malay> <malay>jaga mayat</malay> and then like
some personal reasons [lah] for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
but of course <malay>ibu</malay> also <malay>tak kasi</malay> because she say I will <malay>mati cepat</malay> the I'm like <malay>kalau ajal tu ada mati</malay> [lah] I mean like we cannot
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] like
those type of
incident
car crash [eh] plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee [what]
and
ya [lah] exactly then I was like okay sure
so [ah] basically [ah]
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what <malay>ibu</malay> wants me to do [lah]
so I'm like okay [lah] since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
(um) ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor [orh] an acting
[orh] okay [ah] clown doctor
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
[oh] okay
(uh)
I can fix my own teeth
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
ya
[oh] my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
[eh] the first ya your first show is it
is the <malay>hantu</malay> remember
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little <malay>masih kecil</malay> [kan] that time
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like !wah!
well quite nice [lor]
so
ya
but it was good though
(mm)
[oh] I see
[oh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
ya that's that's the thing
(um) usually people are afraid to set a price
(um)
we calculate our expenses [ah] and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see [lah] (um) like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like [oh] we can sell it from this price to this price no (uh) no lower than that
if it's lower than that (um) means
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>aku rugi</malay> [lah] (mm) (mm)
obviously <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like [oh] I need to to control myself because
<malay>dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> okay <malay>aku tak boleh tak makan</malay> but if I can
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not #chai# I don't like #chai#
[oh] really
[oh] I see
[ah] [ah]
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
[oh] my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
[oh] okay you thinking far
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I don't know [ah] I feel like
even if people <malay>bila</malay>
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
[oh] ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge (um) washing machine
!wow! such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in [what] and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
<malay>silat</malay> ya but then we stop because like (um)
the <malay>penjuru</malay> is it the guru the head of the <malay>silat</malay> or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he <malay>campur</malay> with

one point of time <malay>macam tengah buat benda sendiri</malay> [ah] and then like

one of our uncle also was in the same <malay>silat</malay> with us <malay>siapa tu</malay> [ah] #ariff# [ah] he quitted first and then we quit
so ya
I feel like is a traditional (err) okay (um) one thing I learned about <malay>silat</malay> while doing my research for my last time was
the their <malay>silat</malay> is actually
(um) how to say [ah]
they hold their respect [lah] towards their opponent
[a'ah] <malay>tekan</malay>
like how to say (um) okay <malay>selalunya sekarang orang kat luar</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang gaduh</malay> [kan] <malay>dia rembat</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu</malay> when they are in a battle
(um) they <malay>tunjuk</malay> respect to one another first and they you know <malay>buka bunga</malay> is where you show like [oh] are you ready
to <malay>silat</malay> then ya
ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]

it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman

[oh] like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
like being straightforward it's like just say [lah] like [oh] <malay>apa</malay> I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
but to them I say [oh] okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
like (uh) <malay>aku akan ambil macam angkat</malay> [ah] <malay>baju-baju kotor ni</malay> but some people see it as rude <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
(uh) so <malay>macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kena buat semua benda</malay> [ah] <malay>kat rumah ni</malay>
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know [eh]

[ah] I also don't know [eh] but (um) one of my friends like <malay>dia sekarang dalam</malay> uni and he is a
he major in journalist <malay>bahasa melayu</malay> [lah] so
when I see his works he !wah! like
I feel like
I don't know malay at all because it's another
language ya <malay>macam ada perkataan</malay> like <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so <malay>macam</malay> I feel like
<malay>bahasa melayu ni</malay> is not for today [lah]
it's more of
<malay>orang dulu-dulu</malay> because <malay>orang dulu</malay>
<malay>macam bahasa baku</malay> [kan]
ya correct
it's
like singlish [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we don't usually speak like this but
along the way people <malay>macam</malay> get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of <malay>dekat kau kena</malay>
did you like
<malay>lima minit</malay> short <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah]
