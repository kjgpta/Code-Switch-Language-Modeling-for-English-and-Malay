then I thought like okay lah maybe cause tak cukup tidur ke tak
salah bantal something like that
hey lah how are you man dah lama tak jumpa
really really long time semenjak aku last jumpa you right so how long do you think kita dah lama tak jumpa
no I think kita tak jumpa for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right err last year when do you remember bila dia start
COVID bulan sebelas COVID bulan
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so dah lama gila
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory aku rasa is that
aku baru balik daripada my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that kita dah tak jumpa lagi for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
err my mum bilang aku yang nurul is pregnant was pregnant and then after that eh
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and asal kau tak jumpa dia
and we used to be very very good friends semenjak kita orang kecil lagi
lah you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time kita orang jumpa I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet abeh kau nak berbual english pun dah susah kan
err from my memory is that we went for apa tau performance ya you know that that was like some bengkel kanak-kanak or some do you know remember aksi mat yoyo when we used to be there was remember that show aksi mat yoyo it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
err we met up at mak long punya okay so mak long aminah suriga is the like the producer for those kinds of err shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes pasal dia it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
mm mak long
then kita orang and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so aku I remembered that ah kita start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
aku pun tak tahu how they became friends eh yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you dulu
rumah mak long correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows dekat err bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam performance and then I remembered doing shows kat situ with my sister dengan your sister dengan you together so it's sriwana yes yes you see now it's all coming back
yes I think kita orang were quite active in performance because I remember um quite vividly there was this particular show kita orang semua nak kena remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a kebun is it kebun in malay
engkau ada topeng lah but I do not have a topeng so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because lembu kan ada horns right so I need to be a lembu with horns so what I did was during the song of um old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing dia orang punya topeng
kita happy go lucky just go with the flow mak cakap apa kita buat then after that jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu then just joget
you were a duck I remembered kau itik kau itik because they had if you remember there was this disney nya itik
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be err not confirm just to be sure lah kan kita orang ni iya lah kan
err I remember that you were donald duck and kau joget macam biasa lah you were happy confidently you know yes
err you were itik okay so
lupa ah so err the next memory is bila aku dengan kau we were in your dad's car
baru balik daripada some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right kat luar some lah community centre dulu dia orang cakap apa ah
ya ya ya we all so it was it was actually quite err at that point of time I did remember that kita orang we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I I I remembered that err we were doing good stuff lah which we did not know was good at that time
ya err aku pun ingat yang that that we get to perform then after that balik so getting back to the memory yang in your dad's car aku ingat bapa kau because your your your bapa was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
okay cool cool but I remember kereta tu kecil then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke and so we were at the back dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like oh so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now kita dah tua ni kan it was very it was because it happened by mm ya so I'm not sure okay so your
pasal your bapa suddenly pusing belakang then cakap can you guys stop it or not
so I was err you know I got quite scared of your dad daripada hari tu aku macam eh hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these lah and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes aku rasa
maybe dia bingit ya I mean we kita orang deserved it seratus percent we deserved it
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know err I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that nak bilang kau jer that was a memory ah ya your turn
I remember those moments of education yang aku tak
really oh that was so sweet of you aku feel so err yes
yes aku terharu orang cakap so
really pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa
engkau bukan seorang ya
oh I remember I know where you're going with this I aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well pasal aku ingat at that point of time kan you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle ada tank warna kuning it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then lepas tu ada seat kat belakang
untuk kau duduk then after that that bicycle kecil tau tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang each other it's a chopper
I I I I try to describe it ah so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are tengah hisap rokok ah
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak kan
it oh ya yup yup near our house ah ya the one opposite our house kat rumah bawah block farhan if you remember correctly
salah brother love
john J A B C D E F G H aku pun tak tahu
ya I aku understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then kita lupa nama dia and then after that nama dia apa then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and eh he looks like a john you know oh ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe apa tau lah like they did err they did a study about this dia orang cakap apa tau siapa yang dulu um buat show dengan mak long gitu
mm siapa siapa the kids that buat show dengan sriwana so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if err if you know like if I get to see her eh mak long hi remember me she probably wouldn't pasal ya
ya you can say that I have a janggut it's okay because I I saw you staring at my janggut and aku realise yang kau tengok dengan macam
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole janggut thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do kalau if you don't mind janggut ni sebenarnya apa tau if for me kan aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas
aku malas mm
ya because I realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
ya but gemuk is okay because you know err I I don't mind but
like I am one year younger than you if kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka jer nampak macam ten years older from you and of course aku punya attitude is very mature
err yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila err macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory lah because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so err what happened was err after primary school kan pergi secondary school tapi aku went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from yishun you see I went to saint andrew's school err which is located dekat potong pasir so jauh ah saint andrew's kat potong pasir so saint andrew's dekat potong pasir err aku had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school kan mula pukul tujuh setengah
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty pagi then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah then after that
normal timing correct so during that point of time we jarang jumpa each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
dekat dengan kau punya rumah so which is northland secondary school
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because err there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking kau punya pemandangan kan
that what you must be like terkencing dalam seluar eh
confirm kena rotan with your mom confirm kena rotan with your mom I remembered because your mom is err your mom is very strict err woman from bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam quite err err how to say how should I put it eh verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih best friends you know I mean I mean not as close lah because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that datang balik fade away datang balik but I I appreciate the
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my mak aku punya birthday ya and guess how old my mak aku is
mak aku is sixty six years old lah that is err there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for bulan puasa punya time
bulan puasa punya time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or kita pergi sembahyang jumaat
yes so we did lah but not not not for a very long time lah sekejap aje kita lepak then after that err I bumped into your dad
err he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said eh uncle err how are you because your dad always speaks in english then mak kau berbual melayu so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
ah then after that um ya so um your dad aku jumpa dia then after that err you did ask me this question before eh bapa aku umur seventy almost almost eighty years old kau cakap gitu dengan aku then aku ingat macam eh
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda tau
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad lah my dad will exercise tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke he should be at home or dia keluar rumah
amazing macam bapa aku juga my my dad will wake up like early
but tapi you know looking at him stretching aku rasa he is still you know quite active in that sense pasal sekarang
err during on his birthday right two years ago I think aku belikan dia basikal for his birthday present then sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar as often
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now kan dia orang dia orang kasih err facilities for the old people untuk dia orang workout
correct ya yes correct correct so err what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to masuk class ah join a class yang singapore punya funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so dia orang ada this skillsfuture punya thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some err security course so ya so
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards bila kau nampak kat condo then after that eh uncle how are you
okay lah same same lah like yesterday also takde ubah sama aje like that lah
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking pasal kita orang punya growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road lah sekarang
yes yes that's a good segway actually because um I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially pasal aku realise engkau sampai sekarang masih macam err doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still buat kau punya music semua
hmm okay err is it it's due to the whole COVID punya situation sekarang kan
oh you do err facebook punya session like live punya session is it oh that's cool you know what I found out that err one of our friend's apa ni boy cazly because I did meet up err met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time lah so sekarang dia
when we hang out that time dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook punya account I am not a
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information daripada you know the social media but untuk aku I
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time macam
the reason why I do that is just tak banyak sangat information coming in from left to right too many points too many um you know opinions from the social media dia punya community
tak I don't know kalau does that make sense to kalau aku cakap I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely hmm do I have an imaginary kawan
okay so like basically just to be updated dengan dia orang ah
so what you're telling me that you have like err you have you are talking about facebook right okay so dalam kau punya facebook tu you post like funny funny things
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you pasal engkau I I I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive err person seseorang yang positive lah senang cakap
because how can this guy selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada jer macam funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang whatever oh so then you know that that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya pasal sekarang ni
you know there are a lot of um negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though tengok comment comments kadang-kadang video video guitar lah music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
ya ya ya this is relative to dalam bidang kugiran music selamat hari raya kepada all the people in singapore
hmm I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful kepada diri engkau
actually aku pun aku pun suka orang malaysia lah but depends orang I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person macam mana kau treat orang tapi orang malaysia pasal aku ada banyak sedara my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from penang my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that err dia orang fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather err ran away dia orang lari kahwin lari
kahwin lari so daripada penang tu aku punya datuk macam this is a true story ya this is a true story so err what happened was my they fell in love I don't know how maybe under a tree then after that err datuk arwah datuk aku
yes so err that's the maternal side um my mum's father lah so err arwah datuk aku tu
dia I think he was from thailand also
okay I'm not sure oh no he's from like like descendants of india or something like that lah gedebak gedebuk then after that err they fell in love
under a tree bawah pokok then after that balik lari pergi ke penang for them to get married
wait let me get it straight nenek kau punya kakak which is your
wow that is banyak anak untuk tujuh belas is a lot of kids lah tujuh belas is that's like a that's a factory plus reserves ya plus reserves wow what a woman wow so this is your grand aunty right
memang banyak ah they have like you know like banyak
ya so seventeen is quite a number aku rasa
of numbers so err back to my my my grandparents then after that they got married then err they stayed in penang dia orang duduk kat penang then after that my at one point of time my grandfather like went to singapore and he got a job here in singapore where he became a policeman also something like that I'm not sure aku lupa
then after that err duduk dekat err barrack police err together with my father's father which is my paternal grandfather ah so they became best friends they became best friends then after that my err my mak aku dengan bapak aku
match is it how you is that how you say it matchmake ke apa
matchmake melayu cakap apa eh kalau matchmake melayu cakap apa
kahwin kahwin kahwin kahwin yes kuih kahwin kahwin try lah kuih saya kuih kahwin kahwin married married okay um so so so they they they were matchmake then dia orang kahwin err then after that a few years later dapat kakak aku
kakak aku is currently dekat hong-kong sekarang as you know then he she has her own family kat sana they're happy over there they plan to come back actually for december lah ya they actually bought the tickets and everything then lepas tu err because of the whole current COVID situation dia orang terpaksa cancel dia orang punya flight lah
his name is a tricky one lah err pasal dia pasal bapak dia is a french dude then my sister is malay right so um
nama dia is luq L U Q and then after that ada L U Q luq luq luq
kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman ya so err
luq lucien so that lucien tu is very particular pasal orang french kau nak kena pronounce dia orang punya language in you know because they they they love their language so much it's and I agree that it's very sexy language aku memang suka bila orang french berbual
you know pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy hmm so I like how they they pronounce err stuff and the way they talk especially bila dia orang dah start berbual french abeh nak start berbual english lagi sexy lah but let's not get too deep on the on the sexy part nak kena
okay music part oh so okay sorry you're you're you're done with me ah with my family alright I guess aku rasa aku punya family tak interested tak interesting aku rasa okay ah berbual pasal music ah no lah nah I'm just I'm just kidding that's why that's why I love you lah because you ah whatever mean things that I think is quite mean and then when I say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and I really appreciate that some people kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini you know that kind of thing ah
terbawa-bawa terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah then after that they will scream in the pillow
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to macam apa yang kau berbual tadi
roughly um you know um err as you know I'm working from home right now right so aku ada banyak time kat rumah then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar apa nak beli you know this is this is a typical um you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just pasal aku ada banyak time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes lah as you know aku dulu main drum asal it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated oh ya you do
yang penting kau terror wow that should be that should be your next err malay album punya yang penting kau terror
dengar lah kita orang punya record baru which is called yang penting kau terror
ya dan sekarang aku main guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication nak kena invest kau punya time main guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late lah I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school punya time at the point of kan kau dah start main guitar you know and all this kau dah start main cranberries kau dah ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and aku pula when I was in saint andrew's school kan aku belajar drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then bila kita masuk band together we had a few of our friends then kita masuk a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
yang penting kita terror yes just like your the name of your future album
ya yes pasal okay err the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music pasal
at that point of time kita orang punya band dah tak ada lagi then after that kita orang decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives gedebak gedebuk so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to um dance music
some techno punya stuff some err defected err record stuff which is quite cheesy lah to be honest with you like err they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor punya beats macam that kind of music so mm
so aku dengar um techno aku dengar tech house then there were few other house punya genres ah so they they had err like like like different
genres like sub genres ah within that that genres so I listen to specifically macam tech house deep house that kind of thing so err it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
err I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that kita orang dapat a few gigs kat sentosa dapat main kat club gedebak gedebuk we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect kalau nak buat music tu I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey dia orang punya kerja ni is to mix err satu lagu dengan satu lagu
so dia tak ada stop ah
yes for so for example macam ada satu lagu if he's playing in turntable A right so that lagu belongs to an artist correct so from my err end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
lagu original it's preferable lah you know you know that's the reason why like kalau nak have a band to play err like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have err you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so aku rasa that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya chord belajar dia orang punya style of music
in that kind of genre lah in that kind of context mm ya I mean the whole thing for me aku rasa tak
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like um in sentosa which is an outdoor punya outdoor like
disco discotheque mak mak cakap discotheque kau pergi discotheque tak ah pergi discotheque ah mak
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then lepas tu aku manage to do my own company so I hooked up with err a friend of mine then after um together he was from america then we kita orang joined forces
err aku rasa aku wait wait sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa that was quite some time ago err so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then kita launched kita orang punya own party ah so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play gedebak gedebuk then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment err value to singapore which which is at the highest standard err at that point of time then kita orang
buat duit apart from that you know we err charged people at the door kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat bar
so we managed to make err money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail dalam tu then ya lah
err now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing aku punya guitar
out there in the youtube world sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam youtube you know
kakak kalau ada three wish kakak nak wish apa
a'ah lah kalau apa-apa jer wish dia
so macam top up gitu ah
macam magic gitu
err kalau ada wish eh
first wish nak kahwin ah kot
tapi kalau takde boyfriend pun takpe suami dah jadi
going to three months kot
okay lah dia macam probation period dah rupa gitu
so far belum ah
baru tadi oh
mm I mean we still meet ah just pakai mask and stuff
kita actually meet twice a week seh
ah tak serik lah
uh I met his ibu like oh my god nervous uh I call her for now I call her cik dulu lah cik cik suka makan apa cik suka western ke suka indian ke
uh cik cakap apa-apa jer
tak lah tak tak tak kita pergi kat Al-Ameen woodlands
memang nak jumpa dia ah uh uh so actually it was supposed to be earlier but then bapa dia tak kasi like the bapa don't let the mum go out so then only on friday then the bapa let then okay alhamdulillah then I nervous like heck sia
uh so mak dia jer tahu uh uh
sebab dia tak rapat dia cakap he doesn't even talk to his brothers that much then never really go out then I'm like does your brothers know then like ya
tapi kita berbual sampai malam-malam then every time he'll be like I think my brothers sus me already
then I'm like kalau tahu tahu lah
ya sama
mm mm so far takde alhamdulillah like also because right
so like I read up that it was like uh macam satu adventurous and then satu lagi practical like bila sama-sama dia bagus and dua-dua macam bara api gitu jadi macam passion gitu lah
I don't know ah I don't know belum lagi ah so ya so ya but I forgot our I forgot our chinese zodiac
api jer eh
ah tapi tak lah tak lah garang sangat kan
to betul-betul macam
I macam lagi dua ke tiga gitu I pun terlupa around there lah
I think so lah tapi I think his is at most four years gitu
electric engineer eh electrical engineering ah gitu-gitu ah
uh tapi like
he was telling me also lah like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life gitu so takde direction gitu so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
thought that err because dia punya poly punya course takde exam
so he thought maybe ada exam lagi senang gitu then he thought like maybe like even without macam passion he can still macam buat lah macam survive gitu but then apparently he's like not surviving very well
ya but then he say he finish exam first lah sebab besok dengan besok besok ada
ada exam
if you ask me I say go ahead lah macam if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
ah baru twenty five seh
as from engineering dengan engineering gitu kan
oh boleh macam tu eh
ada strategy tu
macam investment kot I don't know lah eh
tak that's the thing like macam he knows
that he like suka and he wants to do like research in the industry gitu but he don't know where to start and how to get there gitu
uh uh that's what I told him also like that's the first thing I ask macam asal tak pergi digipen like why not then after he say eh I got search for that
then go electrical engineering baru eh
ya ya ya I nak minum air
kerusi aku ni pusing ah
macam suruh dia pergi course counselling ah
I am not the right person to ask also siapa lah aku kan

so sekarang ni twenty twenty jadi next year
uh huh two a'ah betul two
entah lah tengok dulu lah lepas kahwin kot
and I have no pressure to get married so dia macam so you know what don't stress
lepas kahwin baru fikir ya
once your suami is okay with it then like if anybody else says right you can just like kau siapa suami aku cakap okay apa
uh uh kau siapa
maybe in two to three years then I'm like okay lah kau fikir dulu lah
because to me it's not about the duration is not about macam oh lepas dua tahun nak kahwin oh lepas tiga tahun nak kahwin no it's more like
that's why cause kahwin tak senang seh
ya sia mahal seh
ya exactly and then then during your wedding already people like oh your wedding going to be besar ain punya nanti besar-besar tau then I'm like siapa cakap siapa cakap a'ah I'm like excuse me
exactly eh suka hati jer main cakap jer

uh uh uh uh dia dia saja jer
ke hujung eh
kirim salam sampaikan salam nak kasi duit PayNow takpe
uh uh zaman sekarang semua dah PayNow
but ya it like sebab kalau drive dari luar kan nampak dia punya
nama dia seafood restaurant so I don't know whether they like the building is owned by the seafood restaurant or like they do it at the seafood restaurant itself ya
sentosa mahal
go harbourfront go batam terus
feels like that eh rasa macam gitu ya it's like because
dari sentosa kan I always see all this ferry go to batam kalau lah boleh naik satu feri tu kan bagus
best juga tu
mm best apa
habis wallet
tu dia punya tu tight sikit dia punya schedule dia tak boleh lambat
mm mm ya like jangan nak janji melayu eh janji melayu kapal dah jalan eh please eh
ah lepas tu orang lepas tu kalau makcik makcik semua dah lambat habis semua orang muda dekat terus kan habis clubbing terus
tu bachelorette party seh all out seh
uh mocktail ada mocktail ada ya
ya it's a rooftop bar very nice ya me and adik went
you should I mean it's not cheap lah but like ya mm mm it's just strange because it feels like a nice place to for a date but I came with my brother instead so I'm like mm okay ya I went with adik
ya because right we wanted to get the very nice looking drinks and you know macam instagrammable gitu ah but then when we went
it was a like a brunch punya promotion I think uh brunch menu so it was like a buffet instead so I'm like okay lah
free flow macam barbecue then there's also free flow like telur nak omelette ke scrambled egg ke apa burger uh it's very nice but the I remember like everything was nice you know the
pasta you can choose your sauce chilli crab ke nak aglio olio ke apa uh then
uh and then the tacos I didn't try but then adik said it was nice
when I went then the there's like it comes with like a main so I bought the main and it was very nice it's some seafood soup something like that then you cecah dengan roti
uh but then paling best tu barbecue barbecue dia
cause like the sotong and the ikan and the ayam
tak dia barbecuekan dia macam counter kita just
of all things kan ada sotong ada sausage mm okay ada ayam then you know what was there
but I don't know maybe kita tak tahu makan or something lah maybe we just don't know how to eat lah cause we didn't like it ah very much
it tasted like meat you know then I'm like what is this it's very strange ya but then the good part also ada tempat solat
sebab ada banyak benda-benda kan
oh pahit eh
it's just it's just hilarious lah cause every single time then hazim will be like nak pergi staycation then I'm like what me and you
ajak him first
kekek seh
but I don't know whether abang hafiz will be okay with him and if he will be okay with abang hafiz also
can you imagine abang hafiz with another abang hafiz okay then you just put that in mind
think in the end eh in the end they will just like abang hafiz will call you and then hazim will call me like
tapi voucher belum lagi dapat
uh because tak ambil leave mm
baru boleh ambil leave
ya cause now also I need to take leave then tengok budak-budak sekolah ke tak
ya cause dorang deaths I mean not deaths lah but like dorang punya cases like macam tak terjaga jer
mm mm did you see the numbers everytime umi right like whoa wah malaysia punya numbers naik then I'm like umi
it's always because of like macam
tak lah like the whole show I think wasn't that macam
cautious about it dorang macam tak berhati-hati nak ikut rules tau
and then people are saying like that's only the one that's tested then the one yang tak tested
ya and their country also not that develop like especially macam tengok the medical facilities and stuff kan dalam the hospitals semua tu
it's the culture lah like dorang tak macam
gabra sangat lah I will say ya that's why
ya lah macam conspiracy theory lah
I mean in an emergency and pandemic like this kadang-kadang cannot help it
terpaksa you know because of the resources that they have and stuff like that
so macam it's sad but
terpaksa ah
mm entah lah eh kalau orang tua kita yang paling degil kot macam dorang yang selalu lawan why cannot why cannot wear then after that nanti dorang yang
dorang yang selalu marah-marah orang tau I always see you know all those like boomer whatsapp video then always send one right
then it's always it's always the older population tau is always they are the one that is scolding yang budak-budak muda then budak-budak muda pun nak cakap apa
just follow the instructions government cakap tak boleh government cakap if you don't do this fine three hundred dollar not I say one I say not I say one this one governments say one ya
wah and then there is me I was at choa chu kang interchange okay I was waiting for hazim you know I was waiting for my boyfriend and then and macam cause I came early what dah siap kan jadi duduk dulu lah kan you know dekat drop off
err when you drop off ada kerusi-kerusi gitu
so I duduk situ at the drop off area duduk dulu lah tengok TikTok ke apa dulu ah
tengah lepak-lepak habis lepas tu sebelah like
then after that kita macam kita pakai mask kita tak kita tak berbual pun dalam I didn't even notice she was there I swear
then I was just like tiktoking then after that suddenly this group of aunties right like I don't know where they came from also tapi tiba-tiba dorang datang tau like this group of like five aunties I think they came then after that uh dorang macam berbual-bual at this area like very near me ah beside this aunty was sitting so I think they were one group
like one big group tapi cuma ada satu tempat duduk so dia duduk lah
ada lima orang then satu aunty tengah duduk jadi agaknya enam lah tu tak tahu I ni macam primary school maths gitu
ya but then jap jap jap jap I haven't belum habis lagi and then right so he halau them already like kesian this aunties you know they just like there talking they tried to adhere to as many rules as possible already they just want to talk you know then uh uh
like they not even like like not wearing not even spitting or anything you just you know speaking you know tengah berbual-berbual jer seh
after that dorang jalan lah maka terpaksa mereka jalan
this aunty who's sitting dia macam tengah macam lengah-lengah lah nak duduk-duduk because baru duduk tau baru duduk
the pakcik came to me
sejak bila aku tak boleh duduk kat kerusi then I'm like
err okay ah okay then I just like perangai sia then after that I I just left lah like my mood no good already lah then the the aunty who was
sitting at the other seat right then she look at me walk I think she wasn't planning to walk but because I walk right then she look at me then she's like aiyo semua also everything also cannot now semua pun tak boleh then I'm like
a'ah nak buat macam mana aunty takpe lah
tak nak kena saman so ya
I'm telling you ah if we don't wear if you never wear mask and someone sampai sekarang eh the one person sneezed and that person is let's say positive eh
liao satu I'm telling you it's gonna have COVID already
ya so it was dah nak kat satu tahun ah oh my god ya sia
wah cepat seh
then after that only because of that kan only sebab uh of this kan then like
dorang punya living conditions got raised up as well which I think is a positive side effect of this I mean I'm not gonna say that it's a good thing but there are some positive side effect is like one of them is like this macam dormitory is only now baru tahu oh dulu kan dorang tinggal then after that I was thinking
cause kalau tak siapa tahu eh like when was the last time you actually lap itu benda punya handle like I don't know ya so I feel like it's a good reset in a sense lah
when when I was like when I use the soap and I wash wash like betul-betul punya wash like scrub scrub you know the eight step gitu kan
be like what she doing why you wash until so clean like but then ada lah aunty yang cute lah cuba ikut juga lah
macam ya but ya now they don't
ya ya ya is like ya I mean that's why I say like I think there's positive side effects also lah I mean it's not a good thing but you know if you think about it another way mm mm ada lah hikmahnya
so macam kadang-kadang like weekly she will ask us lah so how's your COVID situation when we're like oh it's getting better here you know
cause orang tak ikut orang sana tak ikut rule
like it's a law tapi dorang tak enforce sangat
lepas tu selenga I don't know lah I think
have the whole the whole island eh the whole singapore tengah geram dengan dia
check check that one time eh satu kali
it's just that everybody was just wondering macam sejak bila boleh dua belas orang
kalau phase three pun lapan orang jer
mm tapi
in all honesty at least they jujur but actually saya ada dua belas orang lah that time you know even though you might get saman or what but
ya at least dia come clean
kita sejujur-jujurnya eh are we even as careful as we were las time kan
oh my god how macam mana tu
macam gitu eh bilang orang tak payah makan sudah
ya it's basically tak masuk akal
I'm like nak cakap pun fikir sikit ah like
I I think even a secondary school kid boleh fikir that um even kalau macam situational writing eh I wouldn't come up with this
number one err it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very macam like uh abang why you asking for my name no ah upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in err
that's why lah but of course there's that connotation lah kan tapi it's not it's not really
so ah dia suka dia suka in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here abah was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got zina to sit right beside me
ah that one I didn't get to ask but that one is tak tak important lah ya
so the other ah important part was about his job experience lah so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain lah actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he apa the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and abah were very calm about it tak ada macam problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that eh
ah so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was ah number one ah apa there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then dia tinggal pasir ris
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale lah because they want to look for some a place near err istighfar
because dekat um the parents place pasir ris
this is this could have been boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik lah kan which is to
bilang kan that you want to um do this to both your parents and zina's parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that err the keys you know then what you have to actually this part abah was the one who ah already point out I just reiterated the point
nanti kan macam terdesak kan you have to like actually have to push for this ah then you are making it difficult for both sides
ah then he just he just nodded lah he he understood uh but I was still macam thinking eh do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here ah but I think it's in between lah it's in between that apologetic but also macam like okay
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel what begitu I say it's not about that lah it's about you informing do it properly
ah then I then I also talk to them lah like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan abah also want to hear what is his apa dia punya rancangan lah
um then it was very clear rancangan is that
the next year somewhere dalam march they intend to tunang dengan zina
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet abah probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement lah
the nikah would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least ada
ah then okay then at least say that gives proper time lah for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the abah was saying you know zina just got
err just finish studying jadi apa the plan in these two years for for her uh then this azram cakap oh ya uh this is to would be
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about macam like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me zina also needs to work to build up a
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why macam it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple tak payah tak ada complication
and I and I pun cakap dengan dia lah that
you nak kena
dia zina pun nak kena grow up
asing asing asing masing-masing kena grow up tersendiri
ah so you need give that time untuk you both nak kena grow up ah that's the thing budak itu diam jer so I tak puas hati because like you can just be numb about this whole thing lah that is a which is uh quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that abah is there something you want to uh anything you want to ask them uh I said ya so ah let me check in um so
so one thing that I brought out is you both nak kena
tersendiri grow
memang ah nak kena apa ada this uh
grow up right memang nak kena ada grow up tapi uh growing up needs to needs perlu berada dalam
ah context apa
maksud dia has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that uh growing up takes place both lah during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this ah so I made it very clear that don't just lip service dia perlu perbincangan further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate abah dengar ini tak mahu communicate communicate like tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa abah there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so um I think they got it lah so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
kau orang nak kena sit down nak kena plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say ah ya lah grow grow grow but you just gonna
tak work on it you just gonna macam letak kat tepi jer and just macam put it into the back of your mind tak nak macam
apa buat kerja develop this it's not gonna work
of course I'm not macam blind to this ah
because at the end itu mama dekat kitchen and mm mama malu malu lah apa lah nanti bila kita duduk makan baru mama duduk
dayah tak ada dayah said she doesn't want to be there also lah
I didn't say sembunyi-sembunyi lah I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
body gesture and how he interact with zina he is very firm he's just firm lah it's that not say very firm lah but it's firm macam whatever zina macam nak nak tanya ah ashraf right do you want water then he will just say
very macam he won't just he won't say oh it's okay zina he he won't
so I can see ah and the way he speaks also is macam very direct and very
ya so it's not macam so as as ambiguous as it was lah at least it's kind of macam very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to ah give zina time to work ah give zina time to develop
kita tak tanya pasal dia punya family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
changi business apa changi ah ya that one ya that one warehouse lah ya so
dia macam ya macam I I don't know that
so jadi macam
then abah abah is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that abah like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay abah is comfortable with him already
ah that's something that they will have to macam resolve lah how but at the very least they are giving zina time to grow
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been ah apa been attached to for the three months
ah it was okay normal not not that macam overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that ah the past uh he has yet to have the chance to go for jumaat players
ever since COVID like macam basically he's just trying to share lah like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like macam he just brought up we were talking about jumaat prayers and then we were sharing
ya tak payah macam pening-pening sangat
ah actually after that was a lot more interest lepas itu lagi interesting
was abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir ah ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah
ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik ah ah lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik
tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena kan then I said abah
abah nak kena tengok eh
hidayah okay you you got two different daughters abah cakap apa different both are daughter yes both are your daughters tapi there are two different girls two different daughters
zina is on the receiving end she is zina sudah memang nak menerima
apa berkahwin hidayah I don't think she is there yet dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu
then zina pun add in ah ya but she says she wants to get married ya memang dia nak tapi is she proactive looking no what she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors uh
then uh then I said so abah you need to understand yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan
so abah kena recognize that and dayah is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say abah macam habis kita then I say okay yes I know I I faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana now bila habis sampai bila abah kata
then abah let me give you some advice
if you nak di to even
abah err mama bila nak
calonkan or menunjukkan calon
biar quality
biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada quality dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik of course sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam give up dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah just throw jer ya then mama say tapi the one yang dekat australia itu abah mama tahu tak he is just a taxi driver then dayah will think macam macam bingit lah
because he actually err apa he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to sewakan rumah ini so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
itu lah yang aku cakap
that's why I say cari orang berkualiti berkualiti is not just about
ya so anyway jadi macam
abah understood that lah I said abah tak boleh control apa dayah nak ini
abah boleh control kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh control itu itu yang abah boleh control
so I said right now it seem that dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan fine tapi cari berkualiti this if people are not are ada quality and I said pada abah it's not about social status it's not about macam kaya tak kaya ya it's about the dia nak kena match ah
jadi budak ini dengan dayah are two different people so cannot
then membina diri sendiri eh macam mana
ah lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina
tak boleh zina cakap ah ya ya okay I will look at it lah abang ya
dia cakap abang lah okay
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said oh I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know uh semalam that err you you are ashraf then I was thinking okay how is it macam mana dia akan menerima ini ah cara eh
zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku like
nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama I don't know lah but then lepas itu dia tanya err abang your name is salim is it ah yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me abang ah like if macam dia satay ada banyak ya then abang also can bring back the
so I thought err ya that's why it was easy lah macam abang pun cakap and because like I said
I told ashraf that I'm appreciative yang dia terus terang dia
ada apa ada wawasan lah ah
lepas itu abang pun cakap ah yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak clear ah habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini
encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini ah
okay lah I thought macam the
macam mana it went through was good lah ya
ah azlina azlina need to macam grow up lah on this
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're macam like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has lah correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what ashraf has did did you see or not how ashraf did it
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi
kan daddy cerita senang then I say isn't it simple so that macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru
ah you just have to be upfront jer kan senang and ya lah ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
aku cakap dengan dia yang easy-going dengan being firm
during the discussion dengan ashraf I was saying zina
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study mm ah ashraf dengar jer lah what he want to say he just mm mm
mm but whatever it is he is already macam he never macam like show the reaction of macam you know or he didn't show it lah of being tak nak tak nak apa oh like shock or what I think he knows ah what he's getting into with zina
ya lah I agree of course that's why I said they both tersendiri nak kena grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed tersendiri
if if kalau izat buat gitu then I will tell him off lah eh kau kenal dia ke tak kan kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa so we have to be we have to take this step kita kena uh apa kita mesti
ambil uh
kegiatan begini ah tak boleh macam ah
tak boleh macam apa ambil scenario jer
I faham
no lah dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan no
I was two zero abah open this topic about dayah then I was asking zina zina what have you been talking to dayah lah about dayah's like err relationship or a'ah zina cakap no we don't talk each other huh
sekarang dua-dua sudah try kan
dua-dua sudah try
tak boleh kan so you tell me apa nak kena buat sekarang
nak buat apa sekarang then dia sudah ah ya try again lah try no
sudah try sudah sekarang kan tak boleh kan so nak kena buat apa
do what you want me to tell you the answer takkan lah I have to give you the answer
why you must have the jawapan for me
I want to hear from your own mulut
and then dia cakap ya then kita nak kena ask someone to help ah then siapa this someone to help
kenapa it has to be me to ask you to
you know abang salim kita ada problem
okay just kind of macam jumpa
see things eye to eye tak boleh macam bersefahaman
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why zina kalau if this were the reverse that let's say you and zina you and dayah
macam mana pun that has happen ah izat would still come and apologize to me
then you did zina was saying macam like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to izat
macam like life lah about children about
apa marriage like that that
lah macam ya lah macam like how how he uh apa decided to get married with with salimah then ya we have ya before even during during apa
during ah our apa being after being married also we still talk about macam certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not macam pen pals is not like macam like the way I would talk to faris for example but
macam at least macam things things about personal things I still can talk to him macam I can easily talk to him macam eh izat kau tengok macam ah macam dayah is like I I can have the conversation with izat you know ya I can but macam
dayah and zina will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that macam
no lah not really enstranged like even after this one I I have macam move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise dulu lagi tak boleh apologise pun dia punya ego is so big
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to macam make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms hidayah and zina is different they are just happy with being ignored
dayah zina sudah give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring hidiyah
that's how bad it is ah so at least me and izat kalau kita disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like izat macam has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that macam he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not macam um tak nak berbual dengan si salim no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he macam best character he needs to learn to work it out
kita semua memang have your own areas of growth but
dayah and zina is like they just ignore the problem then I say zina especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi kan lagi kau orang lagi will be more separated
you and dayah ready have a problem bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi what do you think
this passive aggressiveness tak boleh tak boleh ah
and not just macam like ah tak apa no it's not tak apa
ya I I did I did macam tell her lah that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that uh
you nak kena
fikir how
this is important this memang mustahak
you cannot just macam biarkan that this issue err to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
ah first you have to you setuju if you setuju
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak then
jadi it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem masalah yang dia ada ini is trust issues hidayah doesn't trust her because hidayah feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what zina has trust issues because things dayah is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you ah so that's why lah trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts ah so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
tak boleh ah it's just not healthy and you cannot just
biarkan macam gitu jer
mama abah just listen so good thing was
mama abah willing to hear
mm kenapa
zina was uh no I uh zina was saying that she was um the reason why apa she went on to telling izat first because she felt more comfortable talking to izat
then she she sudah bingit lah bila kena rubbish then she walk off
she she kena already lah then she walk off
then say ya of recent years it has been the case ah that's that's the part I said ah rubbish then stop it since when then she already sudah kena then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it lah macam like eh mana wah you are the
so going back to yang tadi kan we were talking about zina and dayah and I was asking zina who do you think you
jadi sebab dia kena tengok and understand that this is the situation
and zina sit down together then they can iron this out lah macam
they just don't see the point in macam making sure that they are
true lah dia tak boleh macam just simply you know say that oh this is a one time deal mesti lah dia ingat
ya so obviously it takes steps lah it's not macam I one time can boleh boleh
akak kakak last kerja kat mana
okay kak okay kalau kalau kerja kat situ kan apa yang akak pelajari
jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar lah daripada incident tu
okay kakak sekarang mempunyai um experience experience di dalam bahagian industri baking um kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba industry yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba
apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar uh kanak-kanak yang kecil
kira kakak tahu kan yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak have the skills untuk cope with this problem
dengan adanya technologies sebagai telefon bimbit dan tablet adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda
kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita around ten years old ke eight years old gitu bila tak ada komputer semua or bila takde handphone kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita time kecil
kakak ingat tak dulu beza eh sebab dulu kita takde netflix takde youtube kita cuma tengok live and live kadang-kadang if you want to go to the toilet nak kena tunggu advertisement
then remember last time you have to apa nak kena rush the toilet kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat
sekarang senang jer now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it kan like how did we survive last time like kalau you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit susah tapi like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
like there's only one computer in the house then kalau if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so kakak remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way macam
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at rumah lama that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
orang kaya kan bagus nak jadi nak jadi kaya-raya
boleh tolong mak bapa sekarang kan pembelanjaan kan banyak that's why I need a lot of money lah and
furthermore now my age is already dah tiga puluh lebih tahun
so I will need the income the additional money to support my mum lah and my dad ni semua
oh ya lagi dua wish okay lagi dua wish is mula-mula nak jadi orang kaya selepas tu nak jadi orang yang kurus
cause I am right now I'm my weight is about one one two so I'm quite fat lah and dulu-dulu kan I was actually um eighty kilo only I was quite fit lah go to gym one week four times
per day I mean four times a week I do all kinds of exercise even at one point in time I even had a abs lah kirakan dua pack ke
empat pack punya abs lah kirakan dah tu I also last time belajar karate judo belajar mixed martial arts semua
cuma sekarang jer lah dah apa tu dah kerja kan jadi pun dah malas
um lepas kaya sihat okay err since my age now is tiga puluh dua tahun I'm just waiting for three more years lah then I wish that I can buy my own I don't want to buy private cause the maintenance tinggi sangat
so I just want to buy itu pun kalau boleh empat bilik lima bilik ataupun masionette lah mana yang I mampu why
cause kalau beli rumah besar sikit boleh rental income so I can meet one of the agent yang I kenal which is my friend lah
ask them for advice so they can help me lah um tolong cari kalau boleh pun nak nak beli rumah dekat-dekat dengan hospital ataupun dekat-dekat dengan any healthcare punya tempat macam polyclinic or what why
cause kalau kita pindah dekat situ I mean kalau kita ada rumah kat situ
kita boleh rental kan rumah dengan nurse nurse lah lagipun nurse gaji kan okay boleh tahan so kirakan kita boleh earn quite a lot from that rental income ah kirakan ah itu saja lah yang my three wishes lah very realistic punya wish ah cause kalau kita wish merepek pun I mean uh bukannya boleh mencapai kan so I will always wish on things that I can achieve I can confirm I can achieve
okay lah kalau if I have any superpowers out of the three right
hmm superpowers eh err superpowers what are the three eh apa best eh mm
tengok gambar avengers
superpowers ah jadi thor ah
thor best ah thor thor is the god of thunder dia boleh pergi to a different realm boleh pergi space boleh pergi sana sini
thor pun kuat kan dia punya ada hammer dia lah hammer ada dua macam macam hammer lah
abeh lepas tu dia boleh pergi mana dia nak pergi he's the strongest ah actually but then there's also another one strongest which is also my choice is a
captain marvel I know that captain marvel is a lady lah but uh actually kalau you can make it into a man punya character pun bagus juga
so it's basically the strongest avengers in all the avengers even thanos pun kalah okay there's one more is I like to be the witch ah a witch
from also from avengers kenapa
cause yang time kita tengok end games tu actually kalau
thanos dia tak panggil ah apa tu dengan dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia who make it link it's actually witch tu witch tu yang akan kalahkan dia lah cause he's already
on the verge of losing bila bila kalah rabak ah but then cause he asked the dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia untuk bring down the ring
so all the yang spaceship besar punya cannon tu kena tembak jer rabak ah kena that's the three superhero that I want
hulk no cause hulk dia besar sangat actually kalau tinggal dekat singapore nak jadi hulk aduh
sebab tu kat singapore kalau nak beli kereta pun jangan beli kereta besar beli kereta kecil sudah kalau beli kereta besar kereta punya parking pun bukannya besar-besar pun
yang parking lama lagi halus-halus jer nak pergi sana sini aduh nak belok jer nak u-turn jer leceh
kita punya roads actually very very small so it's the best kalau
even your body jangan lah jadi macam bodybuilder have a small physique lah kirakan angan badan besar-besar sangat
meal tu apa makan apa-apa ah
ah until now I pernah makan
itu that is very memorable apasal
itu whale meat yang paling mahal sekali
actually dia punya whale meat dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis jer dia potong
lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan ramen ramen
dia punya japanese version punya ramen lah then kita makan
selepas tu first I thought macam dia punya dia punya portion dia is quite big tau besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih too little
oh it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause uh it's not sashimi usually orang jepun kalau kasih sashimi dia akan letak dekat a different plate
but this one is cooked uh but not like deep fry punya cook lah macam I think steam or what lah cause
dia letak on top of the ramen itself so we must eat along on the ramen dengan dia punya
condiments ah basically dengan dia punya seaweed semua lah
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually um the most unique lah paling unique sekali and dia punya
restaurant is actually located outside meiji shrine ah yang pasal halal
tak halal tu actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese punya
restaurant kan once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else macam
babi or any uh meat stuff lah even ayam ke daging ke apa so once they sell barang
seafood is purely hundred percent just barang seafood jer
okay okay yang itu paling best okay yang dia punya whale bila makan it's eh dia punya potong slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
lah put inside my mouth it just melts dia kira macam makan butter gitu cuma rasa dia is bukan butter rasa dia is lemak tapi bukan lemak macam
kambing ke lemak ah no tau it's just lemak
but you just taste the sea water so kirakan
lemak ikan and whale punya lemak is really one of a kind ah it's really wah if
kalau awak pernah makan macam sea urchin ke apa ah macam gitu I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat itu itu yang very very very unique
ah tak pasti isi or fats
but uh mostly it's I think fats ah cause kalau isi whale kan is a tough kan
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut even fats kambing
ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti melts in the mouth
ah so that is the thing and lagipun dia punya I think dia potong tipis-tipis lah so I can't really
actually takde yang okay compare japan korea lah kita jangan cakap pasal thailand
thailand is dia punya makan just semuanya pedas-pedas jer
uh japan boleh tahan uh but japan punya makan is betul-betul
yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu is you know what um makanan korea
cause makanan korea even dia punya mee hitam tu yang
orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa exactly the same as kita punya mee rebus
yes jajangmyeon cause kita punya mee rebus semua the difference is jajangmyeon is macam dia macam basah-basah
dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa exactly the same macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah and of course kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap cause why kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi
and ada telur ada apa so dia orang punya is a mixture of japanese
punya taste bud dengan mix with into mee rebus punya rasa that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique lah quite unique tapi yang I really like about korea is dia punya daging bulgogi
itu I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner dia punya daging bulgogi dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas enough ialah cukup
cause pasal pasal daging bulgogi dia is macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu bulgogi tu you imagine macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate fuh lepas tu makan dengan nasi
nasi biasa nasi panas-panas eh steam rice ke apa
sedap you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you takkan rasa jelak I mean according to my taste lah cause I really like the daging bulgogi
yes I've tried wagyu beef yang halal punya actually we have
until apa tu um A three ke A two usually halal punya wagyu beef there's no A five yang tak halal punya iya yang A five cause um
yang halal punya is actually err it's only made in australia
yang the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself lah yang halal punya is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five punya punya apa tu punya punya grading
the the wagyu beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan yang yang ah
the essence of wagyu beef ah yang banyak marbling it's also I heard there's also a
for the wagyu beef punya itu ah market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya the rest of it is a usually um
tak uh no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia punya is uh dia punya grade not that high lah but dia punya rasa okay lah actually okay lah the thing about
uh wagyu beef is just that dia punya lemak jer
yang if you if you really notice kan dia punya yang urat-urat tu is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the lemak fats is the same
what makes it different is that orang jepun ni dia punya wagyu beef dia suka potong raw
makan macam apa tu the sashimi eh then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that umami effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
ada itu umami punya effect umami effect is exactly like how you
eat macam uh apa tu
ajinomoto dia that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the wagyu beef
uh dia punya lemak-lemak dia
oh like I say just now lah I only eat bulgogi cause that's to me is the best of the best paling sedap
the bulgogi is really my got to lah I've eaten orang makan thailand makan indonesia melayu semua I just like bulgogi cause bulgogi pun kira macam-macam tau a different part of korea yang halal punya they make different type of bulgogi the one that I really like is the budak-budak yang bikin kat
that hill daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua
makanan halal from singapore from malaysia
turkey negeri arab semua ada so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque nama dia
oh tak apa-apa nama dia is is not it's a adalah I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
okay cause dia pun macam road kan so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small macam
err macam mana eh you know like those kind of arab street punya shophouses you go ah
macam gitu you go then adalah dekat situ ah actually yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu
a lot of them and also there are other specialty kan it's actually ayam rebus and dia punya ayam it's actually they take the whole
macam spring chicken dia kasih steam itu benda
and dia rebus kat dalam the chicken soup the chicken broth wah then they they just ah basically
dia tak potong tak apa the steamed chicken tu they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
ah apa tu one bowl of rice
fuh makan sedap ah actually during winter makan tu is the best ah
not really winter lah it's quite cold but not really winter yang I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
dalam minus
twelve ah minus twelve yang paling sejuk ah lepas tu yang paling best kan kat japan on the new year's day new year's day pagi-pagi bangun
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean dia punya snow dia punya snow is tak banyak must wait for the night time then we go to the
ah kalau you go cause tokyo kan is bandar kan so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields dekat yang pokok-pokok ah then you can take the snow from there
err truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore punya weather cause singapore punya weather you can only expect two
punya weather lah like uh autumn
uh apa tu spring lah winter
livelihood lah I mean tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah berapa besar lah rumah kita then lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk weather singapore sendiri dah
dah banyak apa lagi kalau imagine kita kena simpan for
winter clothings lain
autumn clothings lain
spring clothings lain summer clothings lain so we will ah take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal lah that is for me lah but unless it's ah you are
talking about we are living in japan negeri dia besar even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there dia punya rumah sana
murah-murah and actually it's freehold tau it's not macam kita lease
ninety nine years is freehold rumah dia is actually very affordable
kita punya rumah three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized punya rumah in japan freehold
punya scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area macam kita punya
tempat lah hougang ang mo kio
kita punya you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right kalau dekat jepun you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban ah it's macam dia punya heartland ah kira
is all rumah dia is all uh rumah bungalow bungalow bungalow
lepas tu yang ada tempat ada gate yang ada tempat tak ada gate but mostly tempat dia orang is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
dia punya village dia is actually a farm
dia akan farm is actually itu farm dia uh jepun punya beras kan lain kan so basically all the villagers dia akan um
apa tu have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right ah until modernization come lah but that farm itself right untuk kalau
nasi basic punya nasi is actually more than enough to feed the whole
so even until now also there are still people but not young people lah the old people ah dia orang tua-tua yang ah mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right um yang paling best kita orang tourist they let they let us enter
cause dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun
dia orang will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english yang
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english pun is actually
broken english it's not really full uh punya english the language that we learn um from our
oh budak-budak singapore kita punya english is one of the highest grade lah kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa english in all of asian punya country even if you go to like
russia even china you know apatah lagi malaysia indonesia ni semua their english level dengan budak singapore punya level
is really macam langit dengan bumi lain
oh tak for japan tak uh it depends on where you go kalau itu tempat is betul-betul hundred percent muslims okay usually macam gini even if you go
to any other country macam thailand even bali or what kan kalau if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a dua dapur
one dapur is for the halal the other dapur is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they ada dua dapur for those pure
muslims usually yang macam if you go japan is those
orang kita cakap mualaf ah orang jepun mualaf ke apa ah they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the dia punya sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually kalau macam kita punya singapore ada MUIS
ah so they also have their own punya MUIS lah dekat in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those uh restaurants yang mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think dia punya rental dia punya duit
sewa dia every month is very expensive so they need to cover lah they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive mm korea jepun all the same even bali even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop dia punya area
that's how they live their life I mean untuk kita kalau macam extra was-was kita jangan makan but you must we must know that there is actually two dapur
it's not one dapur they make they mix everything together no no no two different dapur
actually they yang the alcohol pun it's not really dapur lah it's just macam a bar just a bar place
err cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty ah but since kita pun dah ada banyak options sekarang so mm
uh what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much lah kalau macam dia cakap buah avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday nanti you get other complications when you get when you eat benda yang is too good everyday is no good if you search
there's this guru from india he say garlic is the best uh medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
uh have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic punya uh cara perubatan really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic punya treatment they all use garlic
itu aje the most the most healthiest yang I eat
apa-apa skills lah is it the the the
hardware dengan software punya skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether nak jadi apa I say I nak jadi kaya kan so
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine ah you dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja eight to five
or kerja shift or whatever
untuk cari nafkah you straightaway have an app
cause sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua they
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in negeri macam kita ni singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause kita punya negeri ah is the hub for education so if we have the right skills kita boleh bikin product from that skill
I suka makan so I kalau boleh skill untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak um but one thing eh kalau I suka masak I don't like to
masak a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before dia punya barang mahal-mahal portion besar yes dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam very posh
tetapi their fusion food macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu even dengan tekak orang putih they don't like cause um when you
fusion western dengan asian punya makanan
uh I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants yang ada makanan fusion yang betul-betul
err how to say ada dia punya rasa dia is you can actually you can want to go there again lah
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event macam birthday ke kawan-kawan nak celebrate birthday promotions ke ah probably
sekali-sekala macam gitu dah but for
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money untuk apa kan
oh ya uh the last skill eh I have eh okay basically for me eh I daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah start belajar karate lah
uh I really want to have that kind of skill untuk
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it macam example karate
ah judo ataupun mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
karate under okinawan punya style
and okinawan punya style is actually the original punya karate lah which is actually
in fact yang karate yang
orang jepun practice is actually fake
cause orang jepun punya karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about orang jepun it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese punya karate
it's called nama dia bukan karate nama dia karate-do
do dalam bahasa jepun is a way of life even judo
all the do yang kat belakang semua is actually maksud orang jepun
is a way of life so orang jepun is more on to the perfectionism
tapi if you really learn the original okinawan punya style it's more of the
the relax orang okinawa actually belajar karate like even
kalau awak awak belajar okinawa punya karate kan
even if you come late the the orang the instructor tu can actually still accept you but for orang jepun punya karate
so untuk orang okinawa punya karate is actually untuk orang malas-malas err like myself
actually orang okay the main difference between okinawa punya karate dengan japanese punya karate is this orang jepun punya karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to oo oo dia kira itu dia punya how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by uh contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think ah orang jepun punya karate is by contracting their body
untuk kasih badan dia tense
uh cause untuk dia orang what they learn from
aikido judo ni semua if you
um you can practise the real okinawan punya punya martial arts ah punya ni karate cause even
dia they call this macam kita ah nama dia bunga-bunga lah kita punya silat bunga-bunga
err orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun
punya is a
nama dia kata kata
so kirakan okinawan punya kata is actually more
practical tapi orang jepun punya kata is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't uh focus about dia punya feel
actually ini karate ni semua eh it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a budak yang belajar okinawan karate dengan japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm budak okinawa they will win cause orang jepun they also learn kata but dia punya kata and karate dia they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause untuk orang
korea punya
orang korea punya the way they fight bila when they practise
but orang jepun dia punya kata
the stands dia punya kuda-kuda dia is
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original punya martial arts fight is for
you ask them to fight each other yang long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan punya orang
come close to japanese punya
karate punya budak
dia akan blur dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin
okinawan punya karate will always win japanese punya karate
but the big but eh orang okinawa even though they are more relax dia punya gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
okinawa punya karate kan every class only maximum ten to fifteen people yang belajar
ah dia punya guru dia they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan punya karate lama-lama is dying out
but japanese punya karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class ada dalam hundred people
two hundred people tiga ratus orang belajar in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese punya karate-do
ah and also in ah in japan punya karate-do
but by right the original karate yang from okinawan one
that is the true essence of okinawan punya karate
ah tu
bezanya it's actually there's a lot of difference ah you can talk
three days three nights eh tiga hari tiga malam boleh
berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis cause it's actually the punya cerita is very interesting
apa eh
okay for singapore context eh aku nak percuma senang jer
cause healthcare dekat singapore yang paling mahal lepas tu
yang lain benda percuma is of course kereta dengan rumah lah rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal
orang budak-budak singapore ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah
yang dia orang boleh mampu uh mostly is that's the case lah lepas tu yang pasal
kereta of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
yang kau dah kasih orang lease for ten years engkau charge orang tu sampai hundred over thousand for a a normal car
carparks yang kita ada is tak cukup
apa barang free nak of course lah nak rumah kereta dengan healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare dah ada pernah personal experience ah kalau dekat singapore you do not have any insurance apa-apa jadi dengan you ah
bayar lah sendiri sampai pokai
kalau ada insurance boleh cover sikit at least duit tu boleh cari juga lah
boleh apa orang cakap ah termampu
kalau no insurance at all ah kena bayar pokai-pokai ah pandai-pandai lah hidup nak
what we do okay kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu
then zaman kegemilangan islam
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the khalifah punya empire
ada dibiayai lah oleh
so apa dia orang bikin
dia belajar um err
zaman-zaman rome punya punya buku-buku
they translate daripada latin pergi arab
in fact ah even the egyptian punya historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why kita banyak actually a lot of our
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually ah push ah macam all the
so kalau untuk zaman sekarang if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing lah we will explore untuk sekarang lagi kita ada we are very modernize
kita akan explore the space ah
ah just ah apa tu
kita manusia ni we we love to explore
we automatically learn a lot of new things lah macam gitu lah
ah repeat repeat soalan
work bukan activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity kalau activity
okay activity yang paling boring kan eh
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight tak boleh cause uh you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
mm kalau okay lah
cause why I every time I hungry kalau rumah tak ada makan I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
kira kan I don't do a lot of stuff
dekat luar I'm always at home so kalau
say about macam bad stuff no lah not really lah
kalau ada bad stuff mesti hidup pun I can't sleep at night also lah
kalau not really lah
I yang pasal ni I can't really say much lah ah ya
dia punya abs tu eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
dia jadi achilles achilles itu punya movie okay I like two movies ah in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is ah ni lah troy so that the difference
is actually pasal orang paling kuat achilles
mm in the end he died he have a choice actually kalau dia if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong lah
had eternal glory macam orang ingat dia
any normal egoistic man he actually uh it shows kita manusia especially man ah uh all
about this movie right about three hundred and ni ah troy is all the quotes that they used
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity itu word eh macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena
so it's it's about the same thing and also dalam
ah gambar-gambar macam achilles ni semua troy ni semua it's all the same thing it's their quotes eh you can actually bring it to real life and ikut lah so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out one lah
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is uh macam
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy yang
texts yang panjang-panjang semua
prefer texts yang macam
yang pendek-pendek short and sweet kirakan macam gitu yes summary and also mostly
thirty two tiga puluh dua tahun
tengah buat apa is it the O levels
apa eh actually seventeen
apa eh actually nak cakap err
actually kalau if I look back in my life right
kalau whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever lah I've been through um but kalau betul-betul nak advice of course lah um
cause at that time also kalau misal kata nak cakap oh you learn coding you learn all these app making right
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn sekolah poly that I learn is actually that was the
err orang yang ajar tu pun the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that err they are not that brilliant also
so if you ask me to macam you know to start a something new I don't think uh there will be good advice cause
microsoft mark zuckerberg ni semua eh the way they start kan is a really is all a downhill task lah
ah so cause also apa-apapun nak kena see
tujuh belas tahun really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned wah betul-betul uh benda baru
wah ni banyak boss semua cakap gini
you just be normal stuff ah five years' time eh okay kalau cakap pasal goals eh um
I don't have the urge to buy a car cause I use to own a car and I know how expensive to own a car in singapore and really I I don't see myself like macam ada have that kind of materialistic punya goals
terus jadi billionaire
I would want to go to that path instead of any of the materialistic thing macam nak beli rumah besar
beli kereta besar all these I don't want cause benda-benda gini semua kita hidup dekat singapore we know that it won't last for cars
ya so the correct so the third year aku move out err then I was uh staying dekat my aunty's punya place lah so what happens is uh I was there uh for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia kan for very long it's about
uh I they gave me hints lah ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years err my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way err they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then uh that was the the time where aku just uh you know just tried to just tried to to survive lah you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof lah and then I was you know so that was a good thing lah
correct so that was that was err err you know err at the end of the three years then err aku early this this this year ah first of january actually
err sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay lah so that means macam um kadang-kadang she will invite me back tau macam um you know to to her to the family home lah but uh sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
um she totally changed bukan change macam apa ah so she totally macam uh you know she she's more err she she literally like uh tries to bother about what I'm doing you know uh getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there tapi uh aku rasa she I don't know whether she realise lah that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing lah so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me lah now err but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months eh we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
yes yes yes rimas rimas is the correct word yes yes I agree I agree
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time ah whenever it I'm the same as you ah mesti kalau macam cakap kan mesti nak menang tau macam in an argument eh kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so I'm always macam energetically fight back tau ah passionate macam fight back tau but nowadays kan macam I I don't know ah kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through uh certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so uh kita macam tak tak uh apa tu there's no more energy to to ah to to expand to to argue tau macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree kan nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer lah you know it's just you know you just you just stop lah just you just don't don't don't speak lah but but it's something that I have always um like macam I I'm really thankful that um she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because err I I knew back then eh I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay lah you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because err dia pergi haji uh last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that uh she came back and err I think I don't know lah maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno tak yang the coklat Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation eh Kinder Bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it is it is that is that oh for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart kan I will I will ah I will be very very uh macam adamant to to keep to my belief style ah so when when I and when I'm that kind eh you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing uh I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in tau
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience lah ya and then apa
I actually find them funny lah it's just like the way they walk lah aku tak boleh dok aku aku kalau tengok dia orang jalan macam gitu kan every time aku tengok like macam it's like eh it's like eh bro your one very big ah bro ya
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for punya apa tu uh yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was uh the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time kan so you ask me to apply for punya apa tu uh opening kan yang yang ala air steward
ya err I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about uh I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like eh come lah just just follow me lah you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat yishun
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat McDonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati lah we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right um the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective tau which which means okay macam let's say for example eh I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand tau kenapa dia macam gitu
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so err and and and it was honestly right my mind ah is always a one track thing so let's say for example kan aku cakap okay I told myself ah I I want to become a pilot but err I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing lah so I I don't have that kind of err presence of mind ah to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
so so my my life in in this industry lah in this aviation industry started out with um with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room uh on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion lah because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight err macam tak err how to say eh uh not hundred percent lah not not not not a six six lah vision lah so uh and at that time kan dia orang very strict kan kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain ah ah tau yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right sebab tu eh they realise eh in err in err eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so dia orang uh they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot tau who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it lah you you no more already lah no more chance right so ah so that was what spurt on my motivation uh and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in uh so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to err err start the flying course ah so that time uh they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents uh fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight ah so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out lah dekat err kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then err they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that lah this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi tau
sekarang ah sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition uh even further because I felt you know ah bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club tau and this was when I was sixteen lah when I was up there it was such a different feeling
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet lah bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing lah that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that lah ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could tapi aku I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics macam science ah science punya subject kan err I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
uh it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time ah I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my uh my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so uh puzzled because did cakap apa tau
uh eh I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics ah but your other topics ah you rabak man you cannot make it why ah then I realise that but it was it was uh uh only way way way later lah then I realise that uh okay I I I actually
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally aku tak boleh bergerak I was just I I and I still remember that day was my uh examination my english paper punya examination and err I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now ah okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it recurred again ya it recurred again so uh that was another dent in my in my in my dreams lah basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi ah punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
err actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave uh my my apa tu orang panggil
uh I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid uh pakai insurance ah macam my medical insurance ah ya err for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
apa working
ada ada sikit uh my mortgage kan every month is uh one point one K uh aku punya err they cut off aku punya uh eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future lah aku aku aku I was thinking lah anyway that one is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me lah which is why I wanted a bigger place uh the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang ah all my baggage my
eh I don't mind man I really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty jer also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area kan and uh the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's uh it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential punya punya place ah
yes I was there uh okay lah it was it was uh it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is um when you are overseas eh err your how do I put it eh you you're considered as an expat tau so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration lah so that's the reason why um most of us kan kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to uh apply with the local punya okay so right now right now err so okay so so right now what happens is this eh
so uh average lah it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level lah I'm not I'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of uh about four K about there lah about about uh thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign dok we even we even err graduated kita semua dah celebrate seh we went out drinking I mean
ah tak tak tak tak tak I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks lah along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's uh
ya I know right macam nasib kentang kan macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before lah this phrase I know I know
tapi I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining lah you know in in every ya so aku I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to uh goes back on track and all that right uh I I'm pretty sure lah one day lah one day I uh you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it lah
eh it's a different skill set lah sia it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself uh being on the drone so when I see it I was like oh okay ya lah but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do uh uh that's relatable and that's uh you know but I think uh they they have already announced macam plans lah you know
uh they want to push us to become uh flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is uh back to normal again right uh I think you know hopefully lah hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old aku tak boleh ah dok flight tak boleh
yes yes actually you are right you are right I I agree tapi dia dia punya orang he's not a war err what you call it eh he's not those ya he's a very selfish businessman but he's not the type of war mongering you know guy that that
exactly you know he's very divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other
ya but dia punya orang macam tak um dia punya words ah he's words are very unwise and also no wisdom lah I I find that he's very different from obama obama eh when he speaks eh dia punya cakap eh all his words eh um they are very substance tau they have a lot of substance
macam their their their thoughts lah
eh kau ada citizenship eh new zealand uh huh
ya bro that's why you need to bring the entertainment to you that means your home right will be your one stop entertainment okay eh but new zealand mahal ke eh tak mahal kan dia punya standard of living huh
ya but I but no aku rasa it's not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam I I don't know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what I'm seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak

those abilities like macam
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours macam you cakap you want to be superman atau pun nak jadi
oh bat sorry batman or iron man okay kau nak jadi batman or iron man I would also want a superpower yang
mm dia bukan dia bukan specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
ah so for me oh ya teleporting eh didn't actually come across my mind until tadi sebut teleporting
any place of the world you tau macam harry potter
err magic spell I forgot lah apa magic spell ah
mm ah disapparate ah dia orang disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age ah
goblet of fire cedric diggory yang ada siapa tu yang handsome tu nama dia ah
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like macam switch on and off
budak-budak kan
for me to macam tahu what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I do not want macam to be burdened
ah boleh on and off ah gitu
the thing is on and off lah I think every superpower ada burdensome
telepathy ah eh sorry apa
it depends lah whether you have more time the thing is people I think people nak this
duit definitely okay
okay apa
superpower macam okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe ah
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or jaga or apa
budak nangis datang kasi peluk to orang besar kan macam nothing ah tapi
in the mata like macam orh
but what if naik lemak
like they dia orang tak nak
they just expect to be given eh dia ni rich apa so tak payah lah work hard so we just wait for him apa to durian runtuh
unlimited duit
it's something that you think of lah but I to me I think you know me as a person kan I'm not a person that wants unlimited duit
with unlimited duit
because ah okay the thing is something there macam
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that apa I respect it's just that I'm just
since you were saying superpower apa ni your superpower of unlimited duit
if there's if that's if there is someone kan macam
ubat for COVID nineteen like the perfect ubat
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study belajar macam mana like
like macam
free only untuk
K the thing is I think kan kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni kan
probably free depending on what type of ubat
err like singapore singapore doesn't give macam a lot of things percuma free
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone betul tak
apa you your superpower that you wanted was
unlimited duit
knowledge you pun macam meh uh macam gitu lah
dengan my personality lah
or do you want to give me a superhero that macam sama dengan I wonder woman
wonder woman is just macam too feminist ah
about wonder woman agaknya macam most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie kekasih dia

itu dekat dengan jalan rasuk eh
so entah lah so let's just wait until mama like reply whether is it like a go ahead or not I mean if she wants to go to sentosa capella I don't mind lah cause you can use the hundred dollars voucher for that what then this one suddenly I'm like cam mana nak kata no
ya lor the the the new park royal is also err halal ya ya ya my sis is going I think in december my both my sis my sis-in-law they are bringing all the budak-budak kecil ah ada some glamping for kids inside the hotel rooms ya
ya then you can use the hundred dollars the rediscover voucher also but this morning I was like looking at the list lah didn't see the kranji one but I saw ada ada apa eh oh I saw got capella then capella you have the spa inside the room
then besides that ada apa lagi eh um W hotel the sentosa one also I mean it's a little bit upscale but then you can use that hundred dollars voucher then all of us can use together right so okay daripada kranji
eh it baru keluar ah
tu lah
eh kalau snow city I can ask any of my ex-colleagues what then can go in for free
ya nanti lah next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy gila
not son of a peach punya
err block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so masa I kecil-kecil there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
then there will also be macam ada bau tak sedap ah but okay my family tak kena sangat ah but our neighbour pernah
nak dengar ghost story
so my neighbour I think tingkat dua we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think pukul sepuluh ke apa there was somebody who came over to their house macam you know the makcik-makcik jual keropok err they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open ah so it it was a makcik selling cake tunjuk the cake all that so macam my neighbour kasihan then my neighbour pun beli lah the cake
so the makcik dah go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a batu nisan inside
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like tersipu-sipu
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents punya renovation so they just got the key on deepavali like after like one month of extension then that one also like a little bit of a merepek ah cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it sebab dorang dah change dorang punya address
abeh entah lah like very niao ah so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november deepavali is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend yang they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so err eventually on fourteen november they got the key then um we went to the house the next day taufik pun pergi the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime cuci jer keluar like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to beli the odour eliminator ah spray around a few times I think err we went on sunday last spray for the things then err I went again on monday
the next day ah the next day bau masih tak hilang ah cause twenty cats seh so spray spray spray lagi still tak hilang abeh bila I balik I was like having like a huge headache then err eventually I call err macam professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser juga so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces ah so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the masuk the nak buat dia eh
tanya eh ni ada berapa kucing ni seh lepas tu I cakap dengan dia lah ada ada twenty cats dia macam wah teruk seh but he was like telling us that err okay ah the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so dia pergi dekat switch then he call us lah say eh I think this house ada pijat punya infestation juga
because apparently on top of the switch ada colour black black black which is actually an indication of tahi pijat ah so he was like hopefully all the pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali ah the all the bed bugs semua but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be pijat or not so yes but yesterday my mum pergi dah tak ada the smell sangat so I guess it worked but
ya err the pijat is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change ah so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went tak ada the smell sangat and then macam um I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but ada lah macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat the living room so macam we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay lah but end up the cause they went again macam
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension kan so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow lah dorang tak kasi then dah jadi my parents house apa so my parents pergi tu yang they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there oi kalau I think if my parents tahu pun they wouldn't have the house lah but no momok so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa lah jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke
you cari you cari dekat which what site
have you tried yang those the punya job fairs pun tak ada
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense pun dorang will go to like some companies
aduh entah lah
or not really I mean tak ada bonus ah and all that apa ya as long as still something ah like my dad got a job my dad kan masa tu kena retire he got a job pun tu tak dapat bonus ke apa so that one is that only contract for one year ya
oh that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family kat airport for like one minute to lambai-lambai only
ya but um he also kena so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants semua kena stay at crowne plaza so ya lah they only like macam see each other bila my brother keluar dari the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his uh daughter cuma lambai
but tak boleh jumpa what is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother dah lama tak makan makanan melayu right so
he requested for nasi lemak on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for apa benda tu nasi ambeng or is it laksa one of it lah then malam he asked for bandung
missing all the local food simon to either macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
err they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still macam makanan the variety is not as much lah ya
what oh mama high class you tak tahu ke
ya but mama high class lah that time ah she was watching her japan show eh at at your house lah then she texted me err nura masa tu kita ada stay dekat hotel tokyo one one of the atas hotel lah then I say no we didn't stay at the atas hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like wah situ ada makanan halal
abeh I said but we also eat makanan halal apa
actually if apa right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb ah then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very macam open to try food ya it's like macam she said like macam okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really lah we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point kan you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
ah itu ramen tu
oh kita orang tak bawa pergi ah sashimi sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya ramen miso but not sushi she say she oh tak makan seaweed kan so tak bawa ah but all the rest dorang makan banyak obese apa
no idea ya like even the um balik punya flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
I agree eh tapi kan nasi lemak I still prefer the silk air punya have you tried ah
oh my god the silk air punya is so nice ya oh I think out of all the err nasi lemak okay ah not counting like parents masak semua kan silk air nasi lemak is like up there ya but you cannot choose what so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with nasi lemak or not
like people say malaysia punya nasi lemak sedap kan I think silk air one that one is sedap
so I was telling taufik like maldives kan ada banyak island kan like can you open up one island just for singaporeans untuk okay what
I think ni kena write in to maldives nya government kan
tak boleh eh
ya lah for as long as he stay there I'm going to like betul-betul tekan
flying some of his friends have been retrenched like err he's flying A three fifty so a three fifty ada banyak flights so during the COVID period he has been to canada he was in new york he was in seattle he was in singapore he was in melbourne err where again
abeh the later later one banyak like holiday people ya but qatar dia punya border control is still strict not like macam
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to lepaskan the requirement of the singapore government ah lepas tu baru they fly to singapore expert
okay lah not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore ah like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian punya banyak like jiwang-jiwang
or rindu family cakap dua minggu jer sekarang dah lapan bulan that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore banyak oh where is the class for this err ataupun rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through
our own life walaupun macam tak banyak benda going on but it's still like a lot of things happening
eh but my parents punya company so far quite good
tapi kan they tak hack the flooring for the they tak hack flooring semua ah they hack the skirting pastu they ah oh the service yard kan kita punya ada the that door the windows ah that one can hack they hack it out
oh ya macam face the apa the main road ke
but actually five year at ubi ones are not bad macam like my house kalau dah five year and a lot of people kan jual the the house if they take care of their houses actually it's not bad it's if you get the previous owner yang teruk tu yang ya ya you have a lot of things to do but I'm sure like if if we sell your house you will buy right
the five year one ah is one that you can consider cuma maybe you have to do the toilet ah
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles yang macam like a little bit kasar-kasar
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi I don't know where they go
entah lah like competition
ya ours macam the my sister punya is like newer tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah ours kalau you tengok the door kan yang dia punya handle is quite solid but my sister punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka
kan abeh dia punya tempat masak the hood dah jatuh-jatuh
ya so if you want to buy buy techno jangan beli bosch
ah ya ya kena macam ada talk forum
then after a few years you kena tukar kan ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it masa kita orang pergi that's why it's like um it's
um it's a little bit more atas than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the dia punya tu macam fulfilling macam very atas kitchen
okay lah I why they didn't choose quartz that time oh cause kita orang pemalas they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz jadi sebab kita nanti take the pot terus letak on the kitchen counter
taufik and I are the pemalas kind
granite the good thing is ya lah if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous pastu um tak banyak choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you kena buat sealing dia lah but kita orang tak pernah buat abeh nampak macam still okay apa takyah lah malas ya
oh okay dekat sini ada mister but I don't know whether they will have the washi tape ke tidak
okay lah okay lah I think some of the stuff not expensive ah but gold colour you better better have to go to JCube dah lama seh tak pergi jcube if I go there I will only go to JEM tomorrow jcube a bit out of the way ah
dorang nak tutup the temporary interchange to pindah to another temporary interchange kan did you read
it will be a temporary interchange again dah ten years eh
I work oh wait before I start working or is still the old one pastu I work the pindah to the temporary interchange and then I dah quit work dah three years with nparks baru pindah to another temporary and then last I read another ten years baru siap
so I cakap hillion dah siap dan yishun punya dah siap and then ah yes correct I think woodlands punya pun will be done before the jurong one will be done who the ah
ada masa the fifty was it ah fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty err apa they will move the science centre then science centre masih kat tempat lama aduh
entah lah ya I mean I would prefer at jurong lah cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be macam dekat dengan water feature entah lah but oh they said after that err they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground err ya
abeh before COVID kenapa tak nak start
apa jer aduh well that's jurong for you tapi jurong punya rumah mahal
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news kata that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is ada ke tidak
kalau you beli rumah nak beli kat mana
no it's just too expensive actually kan taufik and I were like looking to upgrade ke tidak tau cause like we were thinking lah that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over lah but we don't have any extra room what so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
we we were thinking of that but the thing is tapi sebab entah err like that lah slowly lah ya then apanya
we like the house punya location you know bawah there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery tak you don't see like into neighbour punya rumah so nak cari like really our criteria susah
like our neighbours are also okay pastu we have like area kat rumah to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so takpe lah dorang pun dapat menikmati all the pemandangan-pemandangan plants yang taufik bawa balik
tak lah dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok our area quite nice jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok alah tak ada pokok besar lah jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to pun tak crowded then ya then cheap and the tak crowded is the most important criteria
oh ya sekarang parents semua ada whatsapp chat right
pecah-pecah but we don't mind lah cause we know that you can always put back what but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam like perempuan apa melayu terakhir eh
so that's why bawa dia lah pergi wash hands semua pastu keluar dia nampak lego jer terus macam hundred and eighty degrees turn ah like oo what's this pastu ambil then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see taufik punya dorang tak faham
because star wars kan so all the err apa all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take seh and then one of the transformer cup ah you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said oh what's inside then she actually open up
and macam take out all the mini fixed ah aduh and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old pastu dah dah dah do a lot of things lah then start riding a bicycle oh dah can understand a lot ah oh she can baca ayat kursi also
ya kalau dekat schools nak deal with the parents pastu to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other wah macam mana seh mm ya lah that one is also like my last priority
what's that ya for the seven years I dah tak boleh tahan ah at least this one it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain pun tak mendak sangat
yes correct dah hafal sangat
I tak pernah buat tuition like
oh dear actually why they why madrasah tak ambil like the err trained teachers ah
entah lah I'm not too sure
and my sis nak hantar my niece masuk madrasah tau
ah I tak tahu so next year my niece three years old then dia nak hantar pergi those macam ah hafal quran punya classes all that
mm so don't know lah cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so dia kata takpe lah dia nak hantar the my niece pergi masuk madrasah so let's see how it goes anyway baru two years old seh
ya asalkan you ada education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really macam plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think taufik will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid apa bau all the plants also ya I can imagine that
kenapa tak botanist seh
eh dulu I kecil-kecil kan I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
oh I I really wanted to jaga my own kambing-kambing like like want to be self-sustainable gitu like have my kambing-kambing oh sheep sheep so I can like err jual dia punya wool then um like kat new zealand then kat switzerland ke then like macam ada a small muslim community there so I boleh buatkan korban lah dekat their
err what do you think boleh
is it wah just now also I sibeh sleepy sia I don't know why tapi macam I think cause the the err shopping mall was very noisy so macam tak boleh tak boleh concentrate ah so like like everything too noisy then kita pun nak dengar cikgu pun tak boleh then we have to lean remember we were like leaning in to try and hear her like and it was like
ya you all intended to macam invite orang lain or no just the two of you
oh dia datang pukul berapa
then you balik rumah makan eh
mm I like the the chicken cutlet noodles and the chicken cutlet apa tu curry rice
ya it's like just the chicken cutlet so juicy reminds me of that time when I went to punya apa tu dia punya Cheers store kan then lepas tu tak ada tempat makanan halal so I just went to the Cheers store beli dia punya microwave food then err the microwave food I I bought this japanese curry katsu rice
set and then it was honestly okay just that the the curry err the the chicken was like very small and it was I think because microwave kan so it was macam a bit soggy already ya so it wasn't crispy so I'm now I'm thinking about crispy chicken now ya
oh this morning I was actually quite happy cause err I woke up at what time eh like around ten o'clock ya then I was a bit hungry so tapi like err there wasn't enough breakfast for me leftover from my family so I asked my helper to help me cook
nuggets and french fries ya so while she was cooking right then haziq called me ya then then ya haziq called me so I was super super happy because like macam dah lama tak dengar dia punya suara ya so I so I was super happy so the moment I answered the call right
ya cause he wanted to take his laptop hashtag priorities ya then err ya so he he wasn't supposed to walk lah technically but like he just waited for dia punya nurse to close the door then he secretly go and walk to his bag to take the laptop ya then err he was really happy I think he sang like I think like almost ten songs seh
then like he sing kan sampai nurse kat luar semua sampai I think like around like almost the entire ward boleh dengar dia nyanyi ya so like but then the nurses were very happy lah cause dorang pun tengok apa tu dia dah how many days tak macam macam tak sihat so sekarang dia tengah happy dia tengah sihat so dorang pun happy ah
so dorang pun macam tengah motivating him like wah wah today sing a lot ah just sing some more lah okay don't need to wait for tomorrow just sing more now ya so like
alhamdulillah boleh gembira sikit ya my heart is like tenang sikit ya so that was my morning then after that like while he was talking to me his mum suddenly came in like she never in knock apparently ya so mak dia datang pastu dia kena hang up lah so pasal dia tak nak tak nak kena kena tangkap ke apa kan so then err
err then after that he still texted me lah like oh now today like a lot dia nya dia punya sedara datang ya nak nak uh nak visit nak tengok ya so he just like uh kena layan dorang ya then just now right before I met you he was telling me that like dia nak watch netflix on his laptop tapi bapa dia tengah pakai so he was complaining then I'm like never mind lah your bapa tengah
tengah doing work kan then was like ya doing work but ya lah it's okay I'll just use ah then his sister was also using his ipad ya so he was using and his sister was using the ipad lah then he also cannot use to watch netflix so now he's watching TikTok
orang tengah sedih kena makan comfort food then after that gain weight after that gemuk after that uh regret
semalam ya I went out to go to the hospital tapi I tak dapat jumpa haziq lah cause err dia tengah rehat so I just duduk kat bawah jer ya what about you
belajar makan eh makan apa kat situ
no I always go to the choa chu kang one cause I gym kat choa chu kang ya so sometimes after work I go to choa chu kang to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue err I will join is an electronic queue lah so I will go there scan the code then err I will join the queue then after that err they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box punya queue management system is like that
but err in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym ah then cause my gym dia punya bawah ada this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food oh shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets oh damn
right because our house area tak ada burger king dah lama then this is the newest one
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the apa tu the mozzarella cheese burger to other people tapi kalau if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead lah
then I park at this super far away punya car park cause dia punya parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price err all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price macam two dollars sixty cents uh sixteen cents ah ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before kan so
but when I went there I takut like because it's quite ulu
dorang cakap ada shuttle bus ah tapi kalau because I'm gonna go there at night so I takut like
uh kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik kan nanti ada benda
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut ya ya then like I think cause it was so ulu so when I waited a I parked my car kan then after that I waited for the shuttle bus kat bawah
ada like dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok jer probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like uh macam wearing office clothes ish ish lah I was wearing with jeans ah the top macam uh like office punya punya baju lah
ya then after that dorang tengok jer apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini ulu ulu punya tempat
ya so I tapi tak kesah lah so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the makan place the kaki makan tu ya and I ate my favourite err what's that called the lor mai kai ya
then I wanted to buy dia punya what's the one that we ate that time oh dia punya honey barbecue bao the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time dorang tak ada semua dah habis so they only had like siew mai and lor mai kai and the typical nasi lemak so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the nasi lemak so I just got the cause the lor mai kai itself is already quite big right
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then err when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles kan so dorang cakap uh noodles the person who cook the noodles uh only available sampai pukul enam then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay lah uh inshallah next time ada rezeki boleh dah makan
makan noodles dia there was this err it's a bit like ban mian ya it's it looks a bit like ban mian but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to makan ya like you just craving kan
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook dah dah balik rumah lah so I just like okay tak ada rezeki then ya then err ya then I ate there then err the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right dorang tutup uh pukul tujuh
eh pukul tujuh eh pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay sampai kul sembilan ah tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi uh they allow me to sit dekat luar dia punya outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor lah it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya macam in a way communal area lah tapi ada meja so okay lah so I makan there I duduk there sampai pukul sembilan gitu then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya wah ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like err cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
ya but alhamdulillah ya lah okay lah tak nampak apa-apa then I just balik rumah jer lah
ya I think so we still have like macam forty minutes to go
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the selimut then after that you just sleep ya sia it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun lah
ya ya tapi I saw kat sebelah dorang ada roller the want to roll the floor err when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying ah pasal it like last time when I tengah main netball kan I always use that roller to spread out the rain
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know lah I like to travel the world kan ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to apa tu
err stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home tidur one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay lah ya okay I need to aim to be like you
ya I I saw a few videos on it lah during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker tak ada apa-apa nak buat kan ya so I just duduk rumah tengok video like in a way very sensitive content just tengok jer ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me oh you went from then go to wah smart ah then in my recent job interview pun dorang tanya oh I think your academic background is very good
ya so like those err from what I understand is more of like those people yang dorang nak lari dari rumah uh dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah uh apa tu maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that pun ya selalu gaduh kat rumah and all that gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu that kind ya so err that is what apa tu Mendaki is trying to do lah ya this was err last year
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do lah so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the wah the interview was like what like dua jam siol ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya err I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know dorang punya volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of adab in terms of your akhlak semua uh boleh pass lah ya like macam there is no macam red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people yang betul betul need help ah ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then macam err Mendaki has to answer in a way lah so I I understand where they are coming from
very english lah like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible kan ya but then now I mean I am improving lah in a way in my malay err language exposure ya so like when I err my my question to them was like I am macam in a way
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me lah like your just be like your problem is different apa kau kan anak-anak orang kaya that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of lah my intention was to help them tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu uh they don't want me to help then
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so wah I'm like wah if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so macam to be honest in a way I just lost confidence ah like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life macam still huru-hara so I need to let it get it settled first lah don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
like it can be a controversial opinion tapi macam
mm ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as macam maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then macam dorang tak boleh they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard lah like you know like how they say equality versus what ah equity
so macam mana this considered as the start ah
oh just now just now tadi meet up dengan ni dengan rizal
dengan shahrizal
dia punya dia mum passed away and
his mum passed away is about pasal cancer ah
then ah there was err few years ago lah abang tak ingat bila ah
so ya so sekarang dia kerja dia kerja ni dia kerja jual emas

like Ferrero Rocher kind you know so he would do event lah tadi dia cakap
so dia cakap dia just tolong bini dia lah ya lah kan tolong bini dia

the tulang place nearby lah there's another tulang place lah
just go there because I was alamak I was so like not so clever move lah cause I was wearing white right then I eat tulang alamak it was like alamak disaster
ya so the the tulang experience wasn't so enjoyable because you know
dia ada ni lah dia ada apa ada macam titik sikit lah
not bukan macam like yang splash it was
err tulang dropped then there was a splash and I thought it was gone but okay lah but everybody is stained lah just now everybody have err something to remember ya ya
so is very evident lah that everybody ate tulang right so

anyways uh ya you were saying apa tadi afikah pasal
something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got dia ada macam beberapa sample gitu
because in her team kan ada macam leader tau
so leader leader nak kena macam like
err macam leader macam uh if got macam the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier lah
so if this is a macam leader punya role lah
so tapi macam this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge ah you team leader
so they cakap lah got one one time tu
eh dia cakap dia she was in the toilet sekali ada this leader
ah and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking ah talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave ah like macam like you know

cause is like err say I also new say dia cakap like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is uh this indian lady lah older than her like master degree and all
but tapi dia macam I think the quiet type lah you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
oh okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague pun macam like eh
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so tak maybe ya I don't know maybe tak
tak stand out properly I think ya
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay apa like you know at least you know the next job
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good what kita nak orang orang ya that's why
so what was the painting yang painting tu dekat mana
ya so so what's what's what's going on dekat apa gillman baracks is that ah is there anything going on there and when the last time we went there for exhibition right
eh apa tadi
tiba-tiba ah
the first his car tu apa
more than she did that then what's that just now she called me then dia cakap dia nak apa go vivian house tomorrow
ada jer
mangsa dia kan
dah habis eh
okay so nanti next next friday dah decided where to eat
tapi I think dia macam macam weird leh
cause senang lah you are you're opening a restaurant and you are using my name eh
you know eh kau aku one thing then you use my name
oh she came ah tadi
okay habis so sekarang dia tak laptop ke macam mana
eh ya you say you want to have like nak advertise what paid by
so hari ni siapa buat all these err like math questions
there's time for solat there's time to bath there's time to eat
yang first paragraph tu nak kena bagus lah
that's why I was eh ya ada eh accountant
but last time was like very far because apa eh dia macam english camp gitu ah
go this camp ah and like dia ajar dia ada macam
err I think ada video let him talk then he see himself
I think last time eh ada tau macam Mendaki Mendaki macam apa
macam like err after kind and then like
that kind got cedar girls tapi ada ah macam all that ada
macam really smart smart student one ah ah ya lah for sure
tapi ada juga ya some some of them is nice ah nice like talk normally some of them also like a bit weird you know
like macam
then ah think we were int the room then I don't know what's wrong with that guy makan pun nak tidur
then the aircon have to be like super blast one ah then quite sejuk
some Mendaki camp right so we had like solat all that lah
you know they need to pay tahu tak I think tak payah
I don't think I think I go there by self I go there myself I come back pun myself
that one ya uh tapi he buy like those like
nak buat apa sia ni buat apa
tak ingat ah siapa
so tu dia orang lah
ni apa ni ni kira apa ni Facebook ah
ya lah dengar baik dengar they they say that now
err apa eh get the sebab like
like your parents punya house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
so tanya ah your mum macam mana
eh tapi you not there what you should be there I think you should be around ah like to hear like you know that time you were around right mencari sales whatever whatever right
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are dah tukar ke belum
kalau dia dah tukar what is changed you know
ya ya then from there then she cuma
mm so I think what you are concerned that one dah macam like stage three stage four lah to sell like how to like
now is number one kita nak tahu whether boleh
ya boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita belief that can jual also is is it really makes sense to jual
then if jual already then after that then
and like decide on what to do kalau it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
semalam ada dengar yang pasal news yang I think there is another three families yang dia cakap
yang geylang lorong something ya ya ya ya
macam macam weird ah I don't know whether it's an old
family ke apa ke kan
lah this one I just knew like here dengar dekat radio jer
so tinggal lagi berapa minit you cakap tadi berapa minit
besok confirm aku nak kena like
oh dia apa cakap-cakap oo buat dia cakap apa err
kita talk ah I see
si liza left already then talk take another friend
tak ada lah not confidential just talk about family lah family macam gitu
tapi dah cakap like
tak tahu asal lah dia cakap dia oh
sha sha rambut dah putih like I think she he like she got a lot of white hair so is like like what
I got here like thirty minutes lah cause you know ah the train ah super late ah I really hate it you know the aunty mak cik all very irritating
tak lah kau gila punya jauh aku kalau boleh nak naik Grab but I didn't take Grab either no lah I very very everything I just take train or Grab but that time Grab is expensive ah so cannot lah okay I no more money already
eh you text me just now you say kau cakap kau ada mimpi eh
walao eh sakit sia
oh got saga just sambung ah walao eh then the then the second dream whose inside the dream
then the baby like what how she look like is she naughty dia baik ke dia macam
ya lor so macam like got the happy ending lah
ya but so many signs eh already like before sebelum ni pun macam like kau dah ada mimpi-mimpi right like all this type of dreams
so okay my intention is that ah aku nak cakap dengan engkau dulu the dream then after that both of us can like um
but like ten years ago how how umur kau berapa ten years ago
eighteen siapa kau dengan siapa ah masih dengan azee
so enam belas tahun kau tahu lah kan sec four eh ah sec four pun nak cakap apa sia dengan diri aku
dah happening ah actually dok aku sec four pasal aku dah jumpa julie semua apa
aku rasa macam aku wild cause uh I met him towards the end of my sixteen so means aku dah habis A-levels ah
so then ah hakim and I we started meeting and then he taught me how to longboard then we went to gigs but it's like going out with him is very decent like you know macam not say abang lah but he's
longboard I even worked with him at his Sakura part time until the following year uh seventeen years old I I masuk
uh and I hope that you're still friends with hakim which I still am alhamdulillah
our english always berterabur sis
tapi memang irritating ah kan
umur dia berapa macam oh
is she like really obvious that she didn't see you or dia just buat buat tak nampak
ah seh so no I'm like okay I like definitely if you ask me now I don't think there's anything that can make me dislike a person but if I try to backward backward like zaman I more impulsive and reckless
macam kita cakap macam condescending like like kita ni macam bodoh like that then ya lah then macam okay oh oh okay this one is the pettiest reason
because he tegur ah so it make me not like him so it's a petty reason lah
ya lah ya lah it's like okay but then again because the way they tegur ah it's like really kurang ajar also
but there is ways for you to like kejutkan orang you know this engineer ah will really scream at your face yell at your face one leh like like no cara tak ada cara aku aku macam nak sepak muka dia but then
masa kat kerja right tak boleh buat apa-apa so okay lah just terima seadanya jer lah
oh ya I think kau pernah bilang dengan aku ini
she's so weird because pasal kau dengan dia macam tak ada kena mengena gitu
like and then like my friend happens to be that conversation so she she told me then di belakang aku padahalnya macam
she's like kau tahu yang ni tak suka kau then aku macam apasal
she then like I was really shocked lah cause aku really like pandang dia macam sister ah but then like
and then I'm like when I heard that I was like kesian or what like you think your tits are the selling point ah bro
ya and it's like very macam
rabak ah like eh aku oval tak tahu merah ke tak sial bising sial aku oval ha walao eh
then I ask lah who is this girl then he told me then I know that girl what she's my ex-classmate then I then I then aku naive ah habis aku cakap dengan dia ah like
like you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate dia dulu like always
stupid sia you just so stupid like you're so stupid like perangai jantan kebrek punya macam like oh you are les let me turn you straight like you don't try to be some hero and in fact she's the one who manipulated you
so ya lah but I never confronted after her her after that but if I everytime I saw her at school I will just like jeling her so hard and like actually uh like I'm not the type to
hate on girls or are like macam be enemies with them but wow what she did was something so nasty and like even if she never did it to me right let's say she did the whole thing to another person I would still feel so turned off
I know lah like okay your self esteem probably like jatuh because you know all the guys like went to me like I don't blame you for that but for you to take vengeance that way is so dirty and nasty sia
ya babe kau tak payah cakap babe ex aku dia nombor satu babe dia kalau buat benda dia fikir pakai konek jer dulu sebelum apa-apa babe
bodoh sia
I think it's just more to me it comes off to me like wah aku tak tahu ada manusia macam gini macam that can do that to someone else not that I was so hurt by it but I'm just like so
apa babe
ya that's so awesome nanti kalau kau pergi travel settle sia
oh ya and like baca quran and also kau faham
I'm not surprised that you want that because aku macam pernah nampak kau like one like being handy like remember that that that thing jatuh kat toilet
like ah but it's not because I will learn cooking eventually but it will be like beginner level so if I could take one skill that's immediate like chef level mak aku punya level I will take cooking
aku tahu berenang ah but I pun tak pernah masuk dalam ah berenang aku tahu pasal kat secondary school kita belajar
eh float dah okay sia some people don't even know how to float which I teach them also ah sometimes
but ya I would learn how to sea dive actually it's a very ah actually cooking and sea diving I feel is very doable lah can so ya but if I could choose it right now aku terus tahu it's sea diving ah
kau bayar setakat berapa hundred dollars then kau dapat can do sea diving cuma kat singapore nothing to sea dive ah so you have to overseas ah
so third skill if I could pick up okay ah kalau nak cakap nyanyi nyanyi is more of like a natural born lah so tak boleh ah kan
can ke oh kena vocal coaching
ya ah like okay some people macam like born with it like dah bagus but ya there's many cases dia orang macam vocal coaching right
right is the vocal coach yang kau tengok kat YouTube tristan is it
ah I always watch tristan correct and then his recent videos james charles nyanyi dia sedap sia ya it's nice
rabak sial babe
suddenly aku suddenly aku punya spike up banyak apasal
kau can think out of the box kau boleh ambil orang err orang korea orang jepun orang malaysia orang indonesia it's up to kau lor
so you wake up you look at the cermin and then you'll be like oh be that man be like ya sia then eyebrows I've dark eyebrows
but you know kau tahu ah dia kena bahan rabak kan kau tak tahu eh rabak
dia actually from season tak dia tak kena bahang umbrella academy umbrella academy does a great job ya kat luar because
kau faham tak he's young like no lah macam like booboos like err macam on Instagram live macam macam macam acting weird acting macam socially awkward
but I guess the ones who's making fun of him are also about that age ah macam thirteen sia so ya but then it's a lot of them so they really bahang kan him lah ya
but you know goodness kau tu belum lagi nampak
ada satu video dia nyanyi kat Instagram live memang kelakar ah dia macam nyanyi yang yang love yang love love tu but that is not so rabak also
correct cause we're like dude oh wait kita lagi rabak daripada dia kan okay we couldn't even act back then
rabak ah uh correct but then I think after season two ah umbrella academy kan
macam this season dia orang lagi banyak scenes kan and like boleh cakap he bawa the whole show on his back
so it's like even though like the bahang still exist but uh I think a lot of people are giving him acknowledgement and credit that he deserve ah for season two
padahal dia orang tunjuk pun macam the videos of him being socially awkward with his fans online pun macam pada aku like normal seh like it's just like macam
dia macam okay he has a sort of personality lah which is a bit quirky but if we see it as quirky then you will understand why his awkward not as
it can be anything from audio err to like macam you doing cartoon and then he will showcase it and bring it forward to the world you know
like ya that's why uh recently if you saw dia macam post something like hey someone in malaysia can you guys um
err say a a poem a puisi in malay err so that aku like so that dia boleh
wife dia is a like a like a brilliant also like she's some ah president for like an kind of company so
personal life cause I was a fan I was a very huge fan of johnny depp when I was in my teenage years all so aku
okay dia tak resist to adopt like so many kids from different parts of the world
and it takes two hands to clap also and also like I think the relationship between brad pitt and angelina tu pun macam dysfunctioning at that point of time like because brad pitt did come up of thing to be saying that
jennifer still wanted to have fun macam you know they were they were high they were taking weed
and then like when I see her older videos when she was younger right when she was like gila gila
macam you go out you go out of the house and then like so many girls
you can speak korean because that's the body's ability but then nanti ada orang melayu macam ah
aku faham sia dia cakap habis apa macam tapi how you learn that sia
ah ya ya tak payah pergi kerja so there's no nothing like you there's no transaction to get something or whatever so basically right maybe you can imagine the world in a in a more messed up way
like macam dah macam end of times ah tak ada kerja langsung ah macam so macam purge ke apa macam
it could be looked both ways it could be either super peaceful or either rabak it depends on the community I think
huh macam mana kau nak beli benda ya correct
jangan kau messed up dangut sudah sia you need this you
I feel like ya I feel like ya I feel like Netflix should do like a seh can just do a whole show based on this question alone like macam imagine kan
tak pernah ah singapore in general babe
dah banyak benda kita tak dia orang tak buat major it's so boring sia
but ya like the macam
imagine if they did something more non realistic like not family drama and like macam just you know
ah like that's why Netflix shows always make it what right because the umbrella academy is not going to happen in real life like ya apocalypse ini semua
okay definitely cannot be macam a one time hit thing pasal singapore satu
satu island dah jatuh babe ya dia kena macam sikit sikit sikit lah
but I think kalau macam there was like maybe a five episode show ah apocalypse in singapore kan
comedic like from there you know indian to the chinese to the malay then campur them together eh ya sia bro rabak already sia bro
same government and then like suddenly like everybody aunty uncle mak cik all united
oh he want to it could be anything lah ya like you said because global warming ah then you know factory they campak here campak there barang so like
so like using bandages lah obviously if you want to talk the islamic context we already know so we take that away this one is imagination is um ya I will just imagine that one person kena sakit
sakit then lepas tu um
ah dia sakit biasa habis dia dah mati tu kan doctor tu macam nak tengah nak tutup dia habis tu doctor tu sakit but from just sending tahu
then the doctor cough at the wife when he come back home then the wife sakit then the sakit she becomes the first zombie
then maybe we can place this selalu always the lah dapat all this kind of thing korea also already let's put this at malaysia very close home
so ya lah so then it starts from there then then you know malaysia people quite degil right they still want to surau they still want to solat at the masjid so they go and then orang masjid pula kena
gigit zombie and then very close to oh but then singapore is kiasu huh so from the first time we hear the one
person already kena then we already cut the borders so it's quite safe ya we already like
dian kuai dian</mandarin one like very cut that bridge ataupun ya correct
because tak boleh already sia kau tahu kalau macam zombie yang macam macam itu besar boleh lari punya habis sial dia lari sudah sampai dah so we have to like they have to
ya okay if they could if they could swim ah you know how singapura last time the history how we put the
you know the tajam-tajam that we couldn't let the sea the the ikan yang macam panjang ah correct
so we will go back to history and we'll do that so the cannot wah then like ya orang singapore will like train each other like macam
and we're like somehow tercampak from everyone else besides like err indonesia so ya but then this will
so bird flu semua we used to have bird flu lah swine flu lah banyak lah seh mad cow disease
ya macam case macam chronic gila macam kau once flu okay this person is going to die in two days
actually a lot of things sia anything if you do it repetitive for eight hours macam boleh merana sia
so imagine kalau kau brush your teeth it's a normal act tapi imagine you have to do it eight hours
gum kau dah dah dah dah dah sah dah sah dah kau dah over
ya so actually anything could be err ni kalau tapi exercise
cuma only maybe tengok ah it won't be a torture
pasal kau boleh tukar banyak channel kan kesian ah aku kat rumah
ya tak lah pasal kalau kau tengok different different cerita lain ah okay ah kalau kalau kau tengok the same show for eight hour then ya maybe ah
but then if like because kalau tengok ah cerita like err in general for eight hours it's not even like torture it's like it's what we do on like rest days like
ya unless your eating is like macam you can choose what you want to eat so maybe like eat sikit-sikit but
the real torture is like the person gave you nasi ayam okay you need to eat this nasi ayam for the next eight hours repetitively
orang boleh mati sia from exhaustion exhaustion exhaustion what other everyday activity that you wouldn't think is a torture but it's a torture if you do it for eight hours
I think washing your face like washing your face with a facial scrub lapan jam straight
kau punya kulit boleh dry sia
oh my god rabak gila actually anything that you do to do your body for eight hours ah
sometimes he dust it at eight hours so he thinks eight hours always like that now penat aku like clean the like you know he do the whole thing
I think ah ya I don't know why I thought of brushing teeth straightaway that's like ugh eight hours sakit sia gigi aku
teruk sia
aku macam ada high pitch moment uh bila excited macam ni so ya
apa sia
if it's for yourself macam
ya macam I
ya kau pernah other vulnerable component like you just you know I want to go on current god do you like the how is it whatever the I I also have
oh ya kau pernah like dengar kawan kawan kau ada third eye how is it for them like I I also have
ah of course wei menyusahkan sia
correct I but I don't know whether they can choose that option to tutup that batin I think
I think they maybe can but cannot go to bomoh lah go to an ustaz or something lah a skilled ustaz
I also have like my friend's friend ah dia pun boleh nampak benda so macam
it's not everytime akan ada benda but macam sometimes ah so macam tengah lepak ataupun
lepak kat luar pun nanti dia cakap eh ada benda ah kat situ ah atau dalam bilik macam alamak ada benda kat sini ah
are they constant tu or are they consistent
oh they want to scare you sia basically dah tak sui ah sis
oh I know him sia nak saja takutkan ni
ya ya boyfriend mana ni
oh I hate that everytime I ask about that ex you tak even refer nama dia kau just panggil dia misai
and I hate also that aku boleh macam oh ya as
though you only have one ex with one misai but
because his misai was the most evident ya
kau follow dia dekat social media ke tak
okay ada low key ah alright
okay so for me my unusual super power apa sia
I think ah the super power that siapa that
for like betul-betul like for bad people then like macam let's say this bad person was going to kill someone then
she can whisper them like macam you are not going to this you are going to try and believe in yourself you know
use it for really so the person that has that power has such as strong responsibility not to misuse it tau not for herself
like but we cannot macam do it for them as in for example a guy who is immature right we cannot be like
macam cheat code ah macam they don't go through the process so it's more like you are going to start going therapy
but then macam
and also macam I I get it like I also wouldn't want my partner to be misusing it on my child but
so ya but I mean it is messed up but messed up to a point that nak sampai divorce semua macam
chill lah like sort of like she rumour you tak berapa baik lah
kau ingat yang the part where ellen page pergi slice the car
ya ya ya but it's so kesian in the season two end up she never use but her husband irritating
kau just enjoy dia punya power habis kau nak use it the definition of toxic men sia babe aku throughout the movie aku just like
like get go I was trying to obviously give him the benefit of the doubt lah kan pasal dia macam
this like heroic black man but then as we go go through macam and he's not
luther sia aku prefer bluther with allison even though in the first season I was like meh but
dia tu baru cakap kau sayang citizen kau
yes one room flat but then nak kena ada conditions to pass lah so you must like graduate ini semua okay so if you haven't met that those conditions you still live with your parents
but then if you still haven't met that conditions then it's either kau can get the twenty one year old house ataupun stay with your parents
and then the last will be thirty years old which is like a five room flat because nanti kan semua dah ada anak semua apa
so it's all government dah macam plan untuk kau orang
and it's not like semua dapat what it's like there's conditions what so it's also it makes sense what right
ya that's why ya the ration is over there because the thing is with food is free obviously orang yang tak tamak okay lah kan
tapi kau imagine lah orang yang kau tahu kau tahu yang macam dah suka belum apa-apa dah pergi hog semua exactly kau imagine
ya takkan dia sapu
ya no food I think food can't be free I think if I really want one food that is free ah one thing that is free is ah ni sanitary pad
but condoms mana satu pun orang kasi free free per
so anyway uh babe uh kau wish aku lah ah untuk interview aku
eh babe thanks ah pasal kau macam berbual dengan aku semua so aku dah have a gauge
bro aku frus ah bro
what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game aku punya bingit which man U game the one with crystal palace ah
K K K admittedly macam macam budak-budak ah macam main dengan boy look look at look at wilfried freaking zaha what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
geram seh then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about gareth bale and sergio aguero and and thiago
but oh look dia pun sign the only work
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database pakai football manager semak
david moyes kat mana dia baru lawan arteta last week
eh but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna angkat again ah the korang punya the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular thiago
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the barcelona against inter milan punya game ah barcelona ah eh sorry um
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't van gaal doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone yang terus shoot the ball tau
ah basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to kelam kabut he lose the ball there
ya but klopp he he demands the intensity and that kelam kabut
oh sun sun sun sun sun sun sun ah whatever lah melayu swan melayu
bro I have not been playing in that long for a long time aku main best twenty one ah sekarang eh best twenty twenty
ah okay let let me correct that I play a simulation game okay macam FIFA championship manager you is numbers bro lain sia bro ayam itik

macam Google analytics jer ni
marketing punya
give them conquer ah macam
mm dorang kat

hazard a guess benda ni dekat
oh boleh pilih-pilih ah
primary school mak
dorang pun macam ada inner demons dorang ah
mampus serious ah
robert pattison I cannot bayang that man after that glittery shit show on
so you are talking about macam child molesting kind of
okay talking about children aku baru berbual dengan bini aku a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all netflix movies or shows for free
okay bini aku
aku ada Android box but also the smart pun can install there
okay so bini aku past few days we're talking about this she mentioned this Netflix thing tau about how
uh in the last week or last few days alih-alih macam
cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and apa okay ah to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing ah and kau kau tahu the controversy behind it
this de-sexualisation of minors kan selalunya I would say kan syaiton slowly syaiton is slowly inserting his influence on these things ah
but err you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins budak-budak ni they are just
it's my niece ah ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world tau kau imagine eh the fact that
and then you have the goal of the director nama dia macam sounds a muslim maimunah the cold or something dia dia dia macam
ah ya lah ya lah one of the subject people from france punya territories ah
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal ini kan but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like oh it's a coming of
aku nak tahu ni who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through budak-budak sebelas tahun macam
he's he plays like nerdy character macam he himself looks like
a'ah sia eh makin is it okay when back in korang ada dengar rumours
one of my junior in and err budak he err lieutenant in the army when I when I came in through when I was in he was already a lieutenant
he went after then ah and he okay dia dia
dia macam apa tau he's the eager to please ah
I can imagine him kalau dalam eh if you take a platoon in their time
he's one of those who first to volunteer first to it very on the ball nak good kid
very quiet ah dengar cakap
always does his best and high flyer in terms of academics and not a bit so dia physically small but willing to push himself
when I was a recruit in the army kat canteen and and dekat cookhouse and he's a lieutenant there he saw me then he
pause for moment and he's dia gagap tau dia macam err err where he almost called me sir
setahun jer ah ah but you know I retain one year that kind of thing so
his face came out in the news lah surat khabar aku baca straits times I not sure whether he did it or not lah I mean if he go by islamic standards I have to verify
did dia nya he put in the dark net or something
orang kita ah
ah favour ah kau forward pada aku kat WhatsApp
and the thing is what I find important is the prinsip behind the marriage tau pasal back in our ancestors punya time dorang
it's not just a matter of it's a matter of prinsip and honour as well tau macam you don't marry for love you marry first and you make the relationship work the love will come later
they he determines the man is suitable then meminang
perlu ah
no I think the prinsip of have a say ni I think dorang ada cuma the tendency at that in point was ah our parents know best ah so if they think is the man is right enough for us then shouldn't refuse ah
ya I will let let benda ni semua kalau aku dapat menantu macam dia kau nak carikan aku carikan aku macam dia
scary eh aku macam
aku okay I I had a talk with one of my closest cousins ah this guy four years older than me

tu ah I was thinking apa macam sial ah aku tengok is that a code jadi code to your address or
so what's the ayat
so the start of the ayat start at the bottom
I I see what you did that you got ayatul kursi on
give me a good few suggestions eh ah my dad told me there's this good place dekat somewhere near the mushroom park opposite mushroom park
ah it's not at mushroom park tau mushroom park is old chang kee punya run is it's a cafe run by old chang kee but it's apparently across err
I know it's across mushroom park atau across the stadium
anchorvale nya
a'ah it's cheap but you can't get anymore melayu then that ah eh
wait so it it's not a good name cause there's no place to lepak or it's not a good name cause there's no corner for you to lepak
it's like the conundrum you how do you confused a mat you ask him you know put in a round room and ask me to lepak one corner
oh the cross across the simpang ini kan ya correct correct correct
err this kind of thing you have to macam mak bapa ah then sometimes they will advise biasa ah macam orang tua they have their preferred um preferred kadi of choice macam they dorang have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer tak ah kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi ah lembut cara dia berbual that kind of thing lah so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding err you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you err boleh book ah then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of kadi available then all the kadi then they also show like where the kadi lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them lah basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer macam oh takut kadi err they wanted for morning morning wedding kan so dorangnya ceremony for the nikah pagi so dorang tak nak macam kadi takut jam so kalau katakan they wanted to have a eight
um ceremony kan then after that oh nine ceremony then katakan they scared oh if the kadi tinggal pasir ris then my ceremony is in jurong dorang takut kadi datang jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred err they don't have a preferred err kadi sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby ah so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the kadi punya tak
look at the kadi available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of kadi available you just choose ah say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the kadi who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this one you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that dah then you can boleh masuk and book the once your date is available you can go and book lah
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the kadi available
and then after that macam
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the kadi that I want but eventually on that day itself my kadi was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
err for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I err you can ask lina for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit macam tak sabar everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it kadi kadi I think there's only three or four
then everything else is naib kadi ya
ni wali punya thing
I don't think anybody does any kadi reviews last time of course lah ya
mmhmm ya you don't want to you don't want to macam yang draggy draggy until macam kasi trauma that kind of thing kan
mm sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause kadang-kadang macam the orang yang datang tak semua islam
you know kan that's that's one thing that for me also cause macam my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended err nikah ceremony with all the dua and everything with all the ceramah everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them lah
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good kadi but then sometimes you don't want someone who
I think I think the okay when it comes to kadi they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
put yourself in their shoes lah macam dorang
setiap minggu ada nikah to do
they will message you and then he will they usually the kadi will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
why he did that was basically just to macam ingatkan err remind you to bawa your err bawa then documents that you need to bring lah basically and then um some time then err he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp lah he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I um
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say lah then I say tak ah err banyak members dah kahwin then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so macam apa nak cakap and everything all I got it down lah
no need to worry but for some of my friends some kadi will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
ya ke but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script ah err post post nikah ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in err like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to baku ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school macam kau primary school your oral have to be baku kan ya exactly
okay so the initial the initial kadi that we chose um on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague lah basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before lah basically ya ya the kadi before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya um but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the kadi that you want and then set a date with
then turun ah turun err on whichever date that err you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the kadi ah macam oh err tunang saya bapa bukan islam then dia tanya like things of like how what is what's err um lah what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit lah basically ya
I wanted to get the kadi that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one kadi that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that macam
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so macam on the day itself if you need to do then oh semua dah siap
um I would say a lot of people nikah on saturday
a lot of people actually nikah on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate err double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married nikah on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
nak kena faham I mean from their point of view is necessary lah for people to for couples to be macam err ready I mean all these is like err basic rumahtangga punya knowledge ah right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
um civics you know like to for you to understand like oh if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing lah ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of macam very open conversations lah but I find it a waste of time for me personally
is not with the is not you don't interview with your kadi ya you do with with err the the head kadi who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
and the wakil from the bride
as in not not necessarily wakil lah as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought mak ah
I mean like it will be better lah right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought mak so ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether macam
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya err then he banyak soalan juga they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
you don't really you don't have a conversation with kadi until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the kadi
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything kan submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of err the the ustaz is there lah he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things lah I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and lepas tu
I think he asked mak some questions then ask lina some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two kakak there will be asking you macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada marriage prep ni eh err apa for you to go and then you like oh and alamak ni saya bila lah then for me right what happened to me was like dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh sign up ni bagus tau macam very informative and everything lah they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy ah so then after that then they will shut up
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi ah that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all macam a propaganda kind of thing like semua kena pergi you know like kind of thing kena pergi like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word kena you know is like kau kena pergi
ah you know like like cause like typical err like pasar melayu they will like say eh kau kena pergi tau ni
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word kena anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of err islamic laws what for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told alina macam I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage lah I mean to cut down all the cost lah basically like I was telling things things like like dulang it's not compulsory you know things like that then um a lot of the other things lah like red wedding cake lah the kompang lah all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
semua orang duduk kan and semua orang boleh tengok macam oh dia tengah potong cake err
you know but if you have a typical wedding macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan buffet kan dorang jalan ambil makan everything kan a lot of the times my friend potong cake orang kat belakang tak tahu then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple lah some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say oh I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it macam okay aku faham but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know macam if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
ya cause they know I I am degil usually lah when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the dia punya mak andam suka control
mak andam is the the the the bride's err makeup artist lah ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different leh like lina makeup artist makeup jalan mak andam is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife err one of them pakai scarf so the whole day the mak andam there betulkan scarf dia then the other one err what's that called makeup then everything betulkan makeup dia everything kan so
so then the groom's side don't have pak andam err I don't know I think it's called pak andam ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so um the the girl the they they rent the baju kan they rent the baju then they would they kain samping they ask pak andam it's all part of money making process lah
err a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same mak andam
cause people you know like oh ni mak andam aku bagus tau you know your makeup dia baik then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends one then always the same mak andam cause they will try to macam
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that macam aku aku need satu jam nak tukar outfit untuk err pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar makeup dia tukar baju dia one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so katakan all weddings eh
ya whole day so we so basically katakan lepas nikah you plan in your itinerary habis nikah pukul lapan setengah err let's say sebelas setengah your habis nikah sebelas setengah right but then you think is sebelas setengah habis err pukul dua belas tukar baju for the next half I can bet with you sebelas setengah nikah belum habis
ceremony nikah might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar eh dah pukul dua belas
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with orang nak ambil gambar every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing macam semua semua tak pernah I went to any wedding where is macam on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you macam oh eleven O five you come here like no point lah you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad lah you don't you don't macam because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five kita turun bawah eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know mak andam suka macam they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to selit as much time as possible so for example
for me ah I scold my friends mak andam a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing ah cause basically like say for my friend right
dia nikah kat masjid then lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did kat simei yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang to move off they want to move off then after that err I'm supposed to move off at err twelve o'clock so
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen eh no no now is eleven err at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty ke eleven forty five around there
then after that she went err she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the nikah kat masjid is the groom's side
the makan at simei is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum kita nak kena jalan sekarang tau then the groom's mum err tapi pengantin belum makan tau
belum makan eh lepas nikah everything ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan then she said err takpe lah nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga pe
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no kita pengantin makan then I told my friends to go and siapkan the food
she went behind my back again she tell the mak the mak err pengantin both sides eh err tak payah makan eh kita makan kat sana jer eh she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like err err tak tahu awak tanya salam that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how degil and how angry I can get err so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the mak andam cannot say anything lah she cause she want to turn back err she know what I'm gonna say already
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom ah right ah exactly kita dah plan dorang makan apa you want to tell them makan makan ala kadar okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the pengantin table then she sitting down there
tak payah tak payah tak payah like I no lah awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay lah okay lah you know
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty dorang belum start makan tau that in her mind by the time dorang start makan by the time dah gini gini aku tak ada time nak betulkan rambut si dia ni that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible lah you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the macam for me lah as the as the the brides err eh as the best best man I have to macam keep everything running lah ya
ya so those those are the things that for me macam important lah nak kena tahu macam
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be err end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he gi makan prata and everything I told him to go eat prata what ah cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like err suka hati dia nak makan lah he was kat sini ada makan apa eh you are like kau tanya aku kat fort canning mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai prata
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say ah macam you have to also macam recce how much are they charging you for rental lah because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own baju
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her mak andam makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her macam that is all on you
it's not a macam a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that one if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you macam maybe some makeup artists oh this is hundred dollars that one is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are sekali they make you look like a nyonya you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
mm ya but but like I say these kind of thing suruh dewi pergi Instagram go and stalk people lah
ah you can just search makeup artist or mak andam then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check oh wah her makeup very nice ah look very natural and you go see oh it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask dewi to message her alina I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram err for for quotations
ya not necessary mak andam would be worth it if you are planning to rent baju I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they macam oh because it's err package dengan empat baju cause it's err bride and groom tukar dua kali you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of baju
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the baju kurung you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own err western baju for example kan then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this mak andam then she will give you discounts ah that kind of thing lah ya they all have like their full package
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why macam your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to tukar baju from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and mak then that's it lah for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves lah
just to put at the front so when during kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah
orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after orang makan they can go to the park
at the same time you cannot expect people dah makan jalan ah is okay you also cannot expect dah makan jalan lah you know that kind of thing ah eh kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan lah you cannot do that what right
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also oh might as well aku dah datang pukul sebelas might as well aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the nikah all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like wah I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya nikah it started off with nikah alina seated alina seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no kompang or nothing what
mm ya dah habis ambil gambar kita makan ya
the kalau tak nak stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible lah but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was nikah
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like kau nak ambil gambar ni tak ah boleh ah sembarang
boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang ah like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be macam that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you macam he eleven oh eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten nak kena ke bawah eleven fifteen you kita jalan then like
takkan jadi during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take macam you have to tell the makeup oh you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time lah from mak andam we get I get that and everything but the same time macam as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time mah you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on oh this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know dua belas tak boleh ah but anything before that you want to change anything kira for me is like now you can be flexible
and you must also understand macam lepas dah nikah eh nanti ada orang ambil gambar
then nak salam that kind of thing kan and nak orang turun
dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok the tea ceremony
I mean that is considering is still during this period ah I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more lepak ah now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
tak no problem ah no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem lah
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me ah especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now tau macam yang datang members members kau sendiri then macam kalau nak ada bayar I mean you
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just err okay err dia they just ah okay ah keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come gitu gitu just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always macam felt that
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like eh kau buat apa I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee lah I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
you know the emcee who likes to takeover macam oh okay sekarang groom awak jumpa dia macam mana you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
ya I don't find it necessary lah I mean unless you what you will have a macam
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different lah but tak tak macam buang duit ah
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their mak andam and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche macam oh semua orang pose macam gini then kau pose macam gini that kind of thing you want someone who's like aku ada idea aku last weekend aku buat macam gini tau kau nak buat macam gini you know that kind of thing then like eh kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang in thing in thing orang semua ambil gambar macam gini
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side oh macam okay okay okay ambil gambar okay okay kiri kiri sikit okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya cause okay like um after the nikah I told alina I don't want to take pictures first lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu so parents come up here we salam then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties err came up first and then err they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of alina and then after that our photographer macam ya is ya we I understand all this ah they they get super excited ambil gambar dulu cepat before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan lina dulu
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought jom ambil gambar
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be macam okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me err salam parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps lah
um dah lama tu
macam semua jer kau dah pergi

perempuan ada amalina perempuan
eh ada amalina lelaki
oh no no no because that time like ah the minggu sebelum dorang apa ni kahwin I I just went to their new house ah
ya dia jemput then just duduk berbual-bual then he was saying about err I think we're just asking like the school lah ya then I said oh I'm from zhong zheng then say oh zhong zheng I I wanted I wanted that actually she said ah ya but uh akak apa err macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang then mak dia cakap takpe takpe apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know suddenly it dawned on me just now like eh macam that I know if I'm not wrong kau pula as in kau apa your primary school was in griffiths so ya
eh is it still existent dah tak right
no cause last time kan I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really macam kanchiong macam want to push the children
oh no tak

orh eh mm green ridges tampines green banyak ah tampines green banyak sangat
as in dekat blok kau ah dulu
no like takut apa
termati ke apa dia macam wasted all the recording
um ya my budak nakal dia withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything lah is because like the grandpa macam is sick or something like oh having surgery and then um it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
so the kid I mean ah over for macam child care centre punya um like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months ah and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start macam you know february
ya he's going to another school he dia kan very smart kan so dia berbual-bual lah tadi jer uh apa sebelum my shi</mandarin come for work dia dah bilang ni dah oh ah you're going to a new school um ya it's called little school house uh it's at tampines tampines station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart berbual jer like nonstop

I told you right my my colleague apa mengandung I think dah tujuh bulan eh nampak perut besar gila then kena handle budak kecil tau
then dia cakap oh penat ah penat ah dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni pregnant macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni ah dia cakap kan of course

kalau younger kids yes definitely pasal aku cakap kan macam bend asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik ya it's very sakit ah belakang
tak kalau macam um budak kecil like play group like kau kena cebokkan nak tukar diaper semua ya you're constantly using your back leh ah
ya kita orang macam gini okay lah habis kalau kau pregnant macam mana seh

but hujan dia pun macam berhenti
tak hujan eh eh hujan tak
eh ini hari panas seh
eh kau pakai macam sweater leh
macam tebal gila sia
okay that one aku kena tanya achin dulu
kalau dia confirm ke tidak sebab dia tu last minute ada perangai sikit so she's always like last minute tak boleh or boleh so ya
he won't be coming because dia kerja
the best is we we need to ask them apa dia orang prefer eh is it they want to buy first or they nak order tapi kalau order pun leceh I don't think the rider can go up betul tak
then nak kena turun then kalau satu orang order lain-lain kedai
so wati jer lah belum confirm
okay so to lah ni
if the rest tak boleh make it kan I mean dayah can join lah bawa anak dia cause if if it's just the three of us
but but honestly ada orang tak suka
honestly aku cakap dengan kau ada orang tak suka
okay kau tahu kita tengah recording
okay why not kita just give
apa the leeway untuk bawa anak dia so that macam
since macam susah sangat untuk dia dapatkan orang untuk jaga kan and dia tak biasa orang lain jaga anak dia so why not
bawa jer anak dia but then engkau lah yang kena jadi macam discipline mistress
dia complain kat kau ke
okay I understand where you're coming from lah macam kau tak nak kawan-kawan kita nampak anak dia punya attitude macam gitu
kau yang last masuk aku masuk dulu so salah engkau
I mean it's a get together so might as well you you order a dessert selepas makan there's a pencuci mulut
ah then sambil tu berbual berbual gossip gossip kan
ah story story cerita cerita lama ah
ya ya aku pun perasan
maybe she just want to lead a private life lah macam tak nak share most of her personal stuff with uh us
ya like I said ada orang macam dia okay ada orang kau tahu macam
err I'm not into this kind of thing anymore macam no reunions for me I I just wanna lead and love my own family macam ya
macam senyapkan diri ke apa ya ada orang macam gitu kita kena respect juga lah kan
sorry lepas aku dah beranak ni I will need to shut you out from my life
biasa lah mister husband
so apparently achin pun nak kerja ni
like macam
insurance agent aku nak berbual
so aku prudential
rider ada apa kira ke aku rider eh tak mail rider aku pillion
orh tak boleh aku punya
aku applied since two thousand fourteen
ya but then err lepas tu they tried to upgrade aku yang sebelum dah aku dah aku tu aku dah ada cancer so ya

macam macam eldershield care lah macam ada dia punya code code number
err dia under
ah islamic punya
kira macam uh let's say macam prudential tapi prudential ada yang islamic punya
ah dia more to islamic punya so she pay for like two hundred dollars per month
ya and ya aku aku rasa dia punya plan is a good plan punya policy ah that's why
TAQWA is very err kira dah well known already
maybe orang-orang kau yang datang cina cina bangsa indian yang
melayu yang tak tahu pasal TAQWA because a lot of youngsters budak muda
macam around yang achin punya age and below kan ah dia orang semua go for TAQWA TAQWA is a more to macam islamic for the youngsters punya
and dia punya agent is all those macam
social media punya influencer ya
ya ya but it's good very good tapi dia punya agent is not a social media influencer lah no
so okay aku rasa aku rider kot sebab for all aku punya hospital bill kan aku tak payah bayar upfront
aku punya government mm

aku punya is uh mixed so aku tak tahu siapa yang akan menghadap aku untuk labour
aku high risk ah

but yang selalu kena gantung is traffickers
memang orang akan selalu pandang rendah on the malays ah eh

jodoh lah jodoh dia very strong
kau secondary school bukan satu banyak so aku tak tahu mana satu jodoh kau which one ah which one ah
ali celup ya ya ya I recently remembered
oh is he still as good looking and hot like last time or now dah macam terpleot sikit
the body all still sapau lah
dia recognise kau tak
kawan dia girl ke boy sia
sekali dia cakap ya you look like totoro sia
ada any latest photo of him
oh thirty six baya safari lah
okay alamak leceh ah tadi dah sedap-sedap berbual itu lah dah nak dekat tiga minit kita berbual nak buang air liur jer
kenapa angelina tak nak ambil ini eh diploma in apa diploma in children punya studies apa
tapi it takes time apa masa of course like everyone I think like that lah I think macam eventually kalau macam dah get used to it nanti dah tak awkward apa
oh dah submit eh
habis izz nanti ni ah
ulang-alik ulang-alik ah ambil
kat mana eh poly mana
nanti kakak bulan tiga kakak dah start kakak punya course
kat bras basah and err tu yang course yang dia orang nak hantar ni advance certificate in earliest
ah dia orang nak hantar tak certificate tapi by right kakak punya actually I can
I can apply for another cert ah certificate in early childhood tapi kakak tak tahu kenapa the company sent me for this advanced certificate in early years which is err ni ah I think dia orang punya difference is
gaji wise
actually I prefer to take ace apa the other cert the pasal with that cert I actually can teach older children ah
pasal kalau kakak ambil one there's only a limit I can only take err handle kids two months to eighteen months jer
I cannot go for those older kids teach them eh curriculum tak boleh why kalau infant
kita nak ajar apa seh
tu ah tidur kasi makan
tapi tapi ah yang childcare aniq kan offer kakak dia cakap nanti after your course eh ah after you serve your one year punya bond with your company you come and look for me lah dia cakap tadi dia cakap dengan kakak
tapi I prefer here pasal dia orang punya
okay pasal every different different school they have their own different approach tau nak ajar so for this school is play based
my company they focus more on relationship base habis tadi kakak tanya principal principal cakap what is the relationship based curriculum
tak tahu it's just more communication ah with you and the kids ah so but I still prefer nya method because it's play based student learn develop through play
cakap habis dia macam ya whatever lepas tu dia macam why don't you come and work for me lah after your one year punya bond lah
I cakap inshallah lah lepas tu I cakap tapi the plus the downside is dia orang tak sponsor for studies the reason why I take up this company is because dia orang sponsor
go for it eh tapi macam
nak tahu juga dia punya pay wise is it
then tak payah kerja dulu lah since you like belum ada komitmen kan belum ada anak
just go for full time studies jer lah dah kumpul cukup duit tak if you dah kumpul cukup duit then you just go for full time studies better for you because cepat habis instead of that one year maybe six months
of course lah definitely lah that time kakak kan cakap dengan izurin lah kan yang masa korang kahwin kan I told izz if you want to apply for house I can actually recommend the agent okay the agent cakap dengan kakak for now izz tak boleh beli rumah yang
dia punya income now is actually not enough to buy a four room dia actually nak apply rumah four room daerah rumah kakak yang lama tu dekat kan
then err dia cakap then where can he apply lah but actually izz can only get rumah yang dekat boon lay taman jurong dia macam rumah lama old flat lah really old flat
ah tapi macam tempat dia pun not
cakap macam the area not really that
cakap tak apa lah then ah izz cakap tak apa lah tunggu lah tunggu then dah kahwin mana tahu dapat boleh apply
lagi ni but I guess I think sekarang market pun more for buyer punya seller market kira seller untung ah buyer kena keluarkan lebih sikit duit
sembarang sahaja lah cakap sahaja lah janji boleh hit that one hour nya ni minute
ni lagi satu nampak benda bukan-bukan semua pakai tudung jer aku tengok
itu lah I think kakak kak ika ah yang mak cakap yang tadi kita berbual kak ika ah menantu menantu wak jenab
toast belt toast box eh ah toast box ke apa yang kedai makan yang ada jual roti kaya ada breakfast pagi punya ada telur rebus
ah mak suka lopong dekat situ kakak tak tahu kenapa cakap dengan mak mak tidur ni tak jatuh ke dekat tepi mak cakap susah nanti nak nak sapu sampah cakap sapu jer lah
berat lah nak angkat-angkat cuba kakak suruh mak buang ni
this one dah lama sini masa kita baru masuk sini kan pindah was like in two thousand
two thousand berapa eh
two thousand one two thousand lepas kakak habis sekolah kan
two thousand one tak salah kakak kita pindah baru dah berapa lama sekarang dah I think twenty years
ah tadi angelia nak cakap apa
yang yang pakai ada bangs eh tudung
of course lah izz tak bawa pergi jalan-jalan macam mana nak pergi COVID
dia cakap apa tak cakap ah tak berbual lah
tu lah kak ika she's not a local she I don't know whether she's already converted to singapore citizen pasal dia dia daripada batam she's an indonesian she's an indonesian
but dia punya berbual you can actually know that she's not here she's not from here dia ada masih walaupun dia sekarang dah
dia dah tinggal lama dekat sini kan but then her accent still have that that that indonesian accent ya
dia tinggal dekat boon lay kan dengan wak jenab
ah wak jenab yang sikit hari yang angelina datang yang tengah duduk dekat luar tu yang kaki berbungkus ah wak jenab

err but she have three kids ah err tiga orang abang
abang baby nombor dua eh abang ram nombor dua nombor tiga yang bongsu abang baby
the first one tak ada
err because dia
dia ikut bapa dia masa cerai kan he followed the father the father is not muslim
I think dia covert then after that dia revert balik to dia punya original ah agama
err hindu tak salah kakak ah that's why dia punya muka ada muka india india sikit
kakak first kakak tak pernah nampak yang first anak first dia but but err second at the time mak cakap dulu mak jaga lepas tu mak cakap degil mak cakap buli ah buli mak masa kecil masa that time mak tinggal um mak tinggal rumah sewa kan dekat toa payoh so she brought over ah anak-anak dia
mak jaga lah mak cakap degil
nanti izurin tanya mak dulu mak jaga eh anak dia eh nanti mak ceritakan

dia rude
anak saudara bapa semua panggil bapa panggil nama tak panggil cik a'ah I don't know why until now tau habis kalau salam macam kita kalau jumpa orang tua kan salam cium tangan kan tak dia orang tak macam kawan lah begitu
pasal I think dia orang punya age dengan bapa punya age pun especially dengan anak wak masnah nak dekat sama macam dekat lah
nak tak diajar daripada kecil that's why bapa tak rapat sangat dengan adik-beradik bapa
mak pun tak berkenan sangat actually especially dengan wak masnahnya anak tadi kan mak cakap kan a'ah tak berkenan sangat ah
ah macam that time masa kakak kecil-kecil pun tak berbual sangat dengan dia orang yang kakak campur is the youngest child lah yang abang ajak tu kakak cakap yang tu okay dia macam dulu kecil-kecil kan ah dia boleh jaga kita

esok macam mana seh pukul tujuh
there's another one lah tapi dorang from what I heard like dia punya orang tak dia jaga boleh jaga budak tapi tak boleh tukar pampers budak tu
macam ah okay
dia nak jaga budak tapi tak nak jaga tak nak tukar pampers macam berak ni semua tak dia tak buat
dia belum kahwin tau budak tu younger than me ah very young I think about your like your age
dia macam suka main handphone pasal kakak perasan ah bila macam kakak pergi outdoor activity ada dengan class dia dengan kawan dia on the handphone tak jaga budak-budak budak main-main dia on the handphone
kena complaint lah kan sikit hari kan kita ada this centre planning day right ah last week so the the principal brought up all the feedback from the parents ah so dia indicate ada one of the parents ah teachers always on the phone terus kakak cakap wow okay sekali bila kakak jalan kakak pasal kakak keluar dengan lagi dua orang kan two more teachers so like the my friend was like pointing ah at my colleague dia cakap
handphone dia tunjuk tangan begini handphone lah this one lah this one handphone lah habis macam oh okay yang kena complaint dia orang lah dua ni
senyap hmm
sama sama jer like no difference jer like normal lah
ah tapi
tak lah okay jer
tak all the pregnancy macam okay jer tak ada apa-apa jer macam I don't have any anxiety bila nak beranak
macam okay lah beranak beranak okay lah lah beranak ah I don't know why some people eh macam very nervous ah nervous padahal macam tak ada apa-apa jer macam kan macam is it just me or what like err ya tak ada masalah apa-apa just like lay in a bit lepas tu cakap oh time nak sakit sakit lah but the first
I use epidural ah because they said it's very painful very painful I cakap oh I I I don't have eh for mesti tak boleh handle punya lah so cakap ah so when the doctor asks
nak pakai epidural tak then I just say go yes epidural that's why bila macam I mm mm I got one friend off of four pregnancies she never used epidural tapi dia cakap sakit memang sakit lah tapi bila bila masuk beranakkan anaqi
I didn't get to use the epidural apa
then lepas tu I macam it's not really that painful what a'ah ah pasal
err on that day itself yang err abang nasir nasib baik abang nasir tak kerja
so lepas kakak ada macam this craving nak makan sambal pizza sambal pizza ikan bilis tau macam Domino's nya that time so I ate that then macam sakit perut cakap ah nak berak dah tau padahal dah dah due date itself so tak terfikir nak patah balik hospital
so ah then kakak nak tidur lah cakap sakit perut macam nak berak tapi tak berak ah tidur ah tidur sekali macam bangun pukul tujuh lebih eh tujuh setengah like that cakap eh kenapa macam lain macam tau sakit perut macam nak meneran-meneran so I pergi toilet tak keluar pun eh then sakit perut dia macam semacam macam datang tiba-tiba sakit dia contraction cakap eh ni ah maybe this is the time lah
pergi dengan lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir I think we need to go to hospital send send the kids dekat dalam kereta kakak tak boleh tahan tau macam tak boleh jalan cakap eh sakit perut semacam lah
lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir ah err tak boleh tahan ah so along the way pergi dari sini rumah mak pergi
abang nasir kita kakak dah diam tau pasal abang nasir try to talk to me then I just like don't want to reply cakap ah err ya lah um macam please don't talk to me because I don't have the mood to talk I cakap itu ah so on the way I tengok kat tingkap eh bila nak sampai seh bila nak sampai this is like this is this baby is torturing me sampai dekat hospital tak boleh jalan so kakak cakap dengan abang nasir I think you have to get the wheelchair for me I cannot walk
so duduk dekat wheelchair ah sorong naik dekat labour ward
nurse macam tanya uh how is what is your pain score
I cannot say already ah err dia macam ingat kakak bedek-bedek tau cakap just a little bit ah cakap lepas tu dia macam hegeh-hegeh ambil my data err dia cakap can you walk no I cannot walk I really cannot walk I cannot stand okay nevermind lah I help you sekali dah pergi naik atas nak check dia cakap eh baby head come out already tapi kakak rasa macam nak berak ah ah sakit macam nak berak tapi kakak tak ada macam mm nak berak nak bersalin macam tu kind crying no no crying you know
so doctor err nurse masa tu doctor belum sampai pun
so nurse cakap you wait ah you don't push ah because baby dah keluar kan habis you cannot tahan apa so I just I cannot tahan already I rasa I want to push now ah cakap no no no no don't wait for the doctor first dia tahan kakak begini seh cakap no no no no sekali I don't care whoa terus menjerit baby keluar ah baby come out already ah lantak lah buat bodoh tapi actually tak sakit pada kakak
so then bila dah beranakkan aniq pun tak sakit eh sakit sakit juga I think aniq was like the less pain the least painful lah of one aniq I was like struggling a bit because tapi tak nangis lah it's just that tak boleh keluar macam I I think kakak masuk malam pagi pukul satu ke dua
then err sampai esok petang baru kakak beranak
kalau dah doctor nak ni apa pergi caesarean then I told her I don't want I think I want to walk because I feel like it's like I've been on the top of the bed tak gerak so the thing cannot go out apa
so I cakap ah I cakap dengan doctor ah can I just walk
no no you cannot walk you have to stay on the bed if not anything happen then we not responsible dia tak kasi jalan
tapi pasal I think about the same ah sama jer ah then my friend cakap pakai laughing gas ya use laughing gas tengok I don't laugh what
my friend cakap dia pakai tau kakak pakai macam biasa okay jer tak ada apa-apa boring dia cakap dia cakap ada ketawa dia high
ah then abang nasir pakat lah cakap you use this one ah tahan your err masa yang beranakkan aniq ni lah macam sama jer tak ada beza habis nurse cakap lah kat me dia cakap you must use properly you must inhale right then I said what I inhale I inhale what
abang nasir sampai dah tertidur hmm habis tak keluar-keluar dah keluar belum sakit belum habis check check the machine right kakak rasa macam contraction point contraction point hmm okay lah macam rasa tak tak okay jer cakap but the contraction got got some ni tau movement ah eh tak rasa pun doctor sampai keluar masuk sharifah how is your pain
cakap you sure or not you six already eh ya four
wah really ah good ah you cakap okay lah then sekali bila macam eh how come your dia pasal dia cepatkan dia punya ni tau err dia orang pakai oxytocin lah nak cepatkan dia punya err labour it's still the same
dah dah dah dah pecahkan water bag
letak oxytocin sama juga so doctor cakap if you are bad err I give you two more hours if by by this time ah if you never err have any pain err caesarean terus macam huh I don't want caesarean don't want don't want okay I will try I'll try my best
a'ah lepas tu cakap eh budak ni tak nak keluar kot tidur dekat dalam dah dah best dekat dalam
abang nasir cakap ni kalau tak ni kena pergi push bawa naik ward ni nak kena caesarean lepas tu kakak cakap tak nak ah habis dah macam buat kelakar habis abang nasir cakap buka lah buka habis dia tidur dekat sebelah kakak macam eh nak berbual eh tak ada orang tak berbual
beranak habis if your if your pain threshold is high
maybe tak sakit lah pada kakak pain threshold kakak memang high I got high tolerance for pain so that's why macam bila beranak macam tak ada apa-apa tak cuma I think that time masa first punya pregnancy kan orang mesti cakap sakit sakit actually macam tak apa
it's not really that painful then orang cakap sakit tak beranak actually okay lah pada kakak macam macam sakit sembelit nak berak it's just like berak-berak macam constipation that's all hmm
bising ah anaqi he's crying ah
that's why dia cengeng ha kuatkan suara dia
but you cannot just take anyhow jamu you know because err some sekarang jamu tak tak ada macam banyak mixture
err drugs lain so it's already not in a pure form
dulu masa yang kakak bersalin dulu yang urut pun cakap err jamu-jamu sekarang banyak yang campur tak authentic so that's why it's dangerous ah
because it can affect your internal organs apa a
mak lah selalu suruh makan kena paksa makan lah then have to eat habis jamu pakai jamu pill pill okay ah mak punya time lagi teruk jamu macam kena masak punya tau
but what options like kan that time kita tengok a few then after that is like
still macam okay lah boleh lah
I think dalam err a hundred plus ya below two hundred should be okay like I think kita total ada empat orang jer
should be lah anyway pun is
it's dekat mana
tanjong pagar boleh buat apa sia tanjong pagar ada apa
lain kan I always get them mixed up I always get them mixed up I'm just saying yes
yang ah oh that one is yang tiong bahru market kan
ya but I think more or less is confirm lah cause karim punya date pun macam
okay lah it's just satu hari jer apa right monday
anyway can there be a macam
why not cause like every time kita selalu buat like this kind of theme apa
yes ya because that one was dekat yang halia so
tanjong pagar theme apa
orang pakai good morning towels lah
kan I thought that time yang kita pergi makan then I was asking karim to decide on the matter
I don't know I don't know dia dah decide ke belum but I think that time dia ada cakap R
kat sembawang ada too bad kat sembawang ada
eh we did giant ke eh
by the way kipas tu mana
kan panas kat tempat dia
but dinner kita belum choose a place
kat kopitiam jer
nak kena lohei eh
okay kita cari father christmas
like macam
macam carousel
that's very menyemak kalau aku jadi server tu aku bingit
sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak order
he wanted to go there but dia kena cancel or something you know no like the location kena change or something
jonas very vegan makan
I thought we can book but tak boleh mingle
tapi yang last one makan seorang
okay lah macam homecoming ah gitu
I mean tak payah jonas pun susah kan nak makan
nanti edward complain lagi cakap should have change lah should have change lah
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel jer but date is settled lah and I think makan pun is
kat sini pun dekat kan
hotel punya room jer lah
I thought they are going to prioritise yang the elderly or like
don't know kalau dekat sana like
then like it's err pasal plants
like plant nursery with dia punya mak
then um the funny thing was dia seorang jer yang pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask
mak dia tak pakai mask so it's like huh
and ya lah dia orang punya rumah kan selalu mansion mansion berapa storey semua kan so they can afford the space but it's already like
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya dekat desert punya bukan
no no is not succulent it's like probably macam the height
no it's like macam the height of the snake plant ah
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not bukan macam kau punya this thing
it's quite bendy but then bila dia dah tua like it's quite stiff kind
yang dia beli tu is quite an old one so it's quite tall
pokok mango
ada banyak problem than benefit
especially like a globalized world right now macam kalau you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so macam there's a lot of disruptions
bukan natural way lah like like the business way the business way is that macam kena halt and and
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because macam like
you think about it all the businesses dia orang punya momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then kena halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of err during business ah so it's too soon to adapt
cause macam like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area lah but myself like ang mo kio this kind of area my banyak orang-orang tua live right then like you see those apek-apek duduk bawah block baca surat khabar that kind just like just duduk bawah block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is macam
I don't know but I feel lah macam dia orang punya
normal way of living pun kena change forcefully change so in that sense you especially bila dia orang dah like this kind of age
one thing is that dia orang pun could probably be living alone and this is their only form of macam keeping sane and err you know socialise that kind of thing like
businesses wise I think um I think between businesses and societal macam thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think kalau macam
kalau you are just suay lah then you just buka business baru then kena lockdown then macam okay lah too bad for you lah but businesses wise like you said it can be a
err just a method oh oh a matter of adaptation and how quick you are lah but then also macam those traditional businesses pun macam losing out also because
they are traditional lah like kat kedai kopi ni semua
okay lah I mean on the other hand pun macam you need to also see like macam for example cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu
but I think about limitation leh macam like for example the reason why maybe cik limah tak pergi digital is is maybe because dia punya um expertise is not there then kalau she go digital pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help dekat the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya lah but then like on her side pun macam it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then kalau let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
enforcing or like really okay lah enforcing macam a bit tough lah but like um pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
underprivileged families where you are staying macam like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
there was also this macam article I think dekat dekat mana eh
the straits times or something like that yang this um
the and all these case lah basically macam dia orang punya wifi bukannya strong kan like you know you have a lot to handle
aku tengok kat luar tingkap jer
foreign worker punya dorm kan ya
maybe I don't know like dia orang should probably lockdown in stages agaknya um
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the orang-orang tua who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
I mean orang tua like they probably don't have
it's probably just a land line dekat rumah yang ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
cause I think dekat news pun ada cakap pasal the number of domestic abusers
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite lepak
problem okay what do we talk about pasal societal business err
no ya bukannya tracks semua ada pokok
but aedes is because of air bertakung right
unless lah got one pokok pisang dekat in the middle of the north south line from yew tee to kranji
ke wild boar dekat dekat sembawang
dia orang enforce the rule people will really follow apa it's like you have all those mm mm
kau bunuh ah
apa benda kau bunuh lion tu
were these animals obtain kan and so kalau macam they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
merepek ah
remember there was this report pasal mink farm dekat mana entah
that animals roasted already lah pantang liao
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not dia punya
wait lah nanti dia dah besar dah lah letak balik kat dalam
so technically dia orang punya care is quite princess lah they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves gulung like that then they will
this thing doesn't gulung what
dia jadi go
dia jadi brown
I didn't know then no I never no lah tak jadi
ya like it cannot get cold seem like merepek ah dia just setakat satu malam jer
apa is standard pokok
ya bodoh
ya so it's a very sturdy plant dia punya leaf macam like those kind of pokok pisang punya leaves but it's err
of course right cause you are not pokok pisang
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully dia tak mati
they never like pakai those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the dabao there from container dia just scoop air gitu then dia
pail of water and pour the plant mah dia pakai watering can jer
ya I mean they will say lah like macam kalau the top all the dry then you can water that kind lah bukannya hari-hari dia water the plant
actually kan aku tak because uh mak aku like whenever she cook she will buka the YouTube punya
apa tu video ya because dia tak ada Spotify so she will use the YouTube ah while she cook
tapi macam a bit merepek cause last time can misteri jam dua belas kat radio kan so you listen to it at night literally before twelve but ni dia tengok bila tengah macam petang cause tengah masak kan you had any stories on your
kau kau dengar
ya ya the when one yang you were studying at home kan
aku aku weh pun nak dengar ah
keras kan ya
how sia because that time I I didn't know how keras it was until I came aku balik lambat that time because the the tempat that I live kan is betul-betul opposite the
benda-benda tu the and the muslim world
and then dia macam dalam tau sebelah ha the best part tempat aku tinggal is betul-betul sebelah fuchun primary
no no the one that I'm staying in sekarang ya
aku tak tahu aku tahu dia marsiling
the one yang opposite the tu
the the police dengan muslim world
tak ah yours is dalam lagi sikit
ya sebab tu yang tadi pagi yang aku
bangun masa extra awal lah cause I thought it was late but the the bus stop is literally dekat depan like depan block ah so I took
nine six six direct straight all the way pergi I'm like ah I came here within forty five minutes
ya but it's only untuk tiga minggu jer
entah I don't know my parents my family is living there like we just take a rental
ya so after the three weeks then kita boleh masuk the new house lah
ya ya ya betul-betul next to ya fuchun section primary so I think it's the new one ya by tak tu kat
ya tu aku tu aku tak berani because the next bus kan yang pass by that tempat ya I saw like oh
ya I'm like okay tak apa aku tak nak pergi sini
macam mana kau masuk the sekolah like is it they give you
like is it like macam kalau secondary school kan like dia orang kasi like that booklet kan untuk uh like you can either apply directly atau you go through the system kan then for primary apa like kau apply directly or
kau fikir ni TOTO ke apa
that one aku tak tahu ah because their
so that's what your what your parents bid ah ya but ya and hantu
mmhmm kau primary school ada cadet
apa seh tu korang kena belajar history
huh founder kat singapore
ya betul lah ya
asal oh okay
because my school punya like very limited so dia orang cuma ada like sports
uh apa lagi eh
I think that's about it and then when bila aku baru nak graduate then dia offered arts
so like dari like from primary school uh I was in track and field uh apa nama benda tu tak tak it's not netball
aku tengok home econs aku macam apa kau orang belajar kat sini ya they learn how to cook there was a competition for cooking
home econs belajar apa
oh aku dengar for like for the exam you literally have to cook
like oops tak apa darurat
oh no they say like kalau ha you can it's like god purposely let you makan because ya five minutes
I never studied music so bila aku kat poly kan
because in poly I joined the percussion punya band
and then there was this one part of the test where the instructor ajar kita orang how to read music tapi aku lost gila ya
aku lost because like he was teaching us like paradiddle ke apa entah how to do the how to keep how to macam ha stay in beat and listen to the rhythm ke apa because our instructor tu was from yuhua punya like some band thing ah
aku just lost so dia macam we had to pass the test and we had to learn how to draw the symbols semua a'ah
okay lah aku aku pass the paper lah but the actual practical aku macam huh
dengan flute kan tak eh
oh oh that's recorder oh aku teringat squidward clarinet
tu bukan gong lah merepek
the what rebana
oh that one is like dia macam xylophone gitu kan it's something like that lah tapi dia like circle circle
but ya kau jadi apa malay dance
fusion macam mana kau joget sia
handball aku tak tahu uh huh
actually lah at first macam macam malas kan but then after awhile then you're like okay
camp qiam ah
uh I think ada lah because we had this program in primary six yang eh kaki kau ada semut
uh and then apa tu that one kita it's like uh like you know those masa adam khoo punya camps
everytime ada camp kan mesti ada that night walk tau ya and then before night walk they will always show you cerita hantu tau atau cerita seram before that so for that for that one they showed us uh movie the orphan I think
honestly aku tak ingat because
it was quite scary because the sekolah that we had to go was wak tanjong ya then wak tanjong kan it's like
macam kampung lama right I think it was like rumah orang ah dulu
ya then so macam we had to crawl over stuff and benda semua tapi aku mesti teringat mesti ada hantu kat sini something like haunted house ah ya
mm then dia orang cakap ah macam if kalau if you see anything uh you try to find the
facilitator ah because they have a glow stick I'm like habis kalau facilitator benda lain macam mana
oo yang army I think the first episode ke second episode
oh ah yang bila dia baru masuk eh habis dia kena bully kan cause mak dia hantar dia a'ah
tu kat tekong eh tak eh kat mana seh
oh macam apa tu like ha caterpillar baru nak cakap train
so korang apa masuk alam bunian
ya is it korang like got trapped
in the tempat eh
macam dah nak siap to tidur ah
ya korang you take some time lah ya
tak which makes me think sebab sebab like kau tahu nak cakap bugis kan ada this tempat where
uh that road is called uh jalan kubur
ya basically sebelah aljunied right so like the entire stretch semua kubur tau and then it's very like rapat-rapat
it's literally next to the madrasah it's the I think the the founder of the sekolah punya family aljunied ya
oh because that used to be dia punya tempat ah like is it like the ha the tanah or the kampung where most of them tinggal kat situ ah
aku macam no because aku baru perasan kan because that time I I was going home and then aku nak pergi bus stop then so I went to the bus stop
literally belakang bus stop tu so macam
sini ada kubur-kubur then bus stop kat sini so kalau kau nak pergi bus stop you have to pass by the kubur ah
I didn't I was like how can it be that close seh tak seram ke
and macam I
ya is it dia orang tak perasan ke dia orang tak kesah
oh yang tu lah
tak seram seh because when I went to the bus stop it was dah malam
and then aku macam it was very like seram ah aku just tengah jalan minding my own business and then pergi bus stop aku nak cari bus and aku tengok tepi I was like eh kubur
kena culik eh
kenapa bau bau bangkai eh
ke just bau tanah like fertiliser
kat luar kan bye
asal eh is it dia punya no no no as in the tempat tempat mandi dia is like covered eh or is it like open air oh so kirakan dia just macam panel lah
it's a kolah right
ya tak comfortable lah
is it a real thing though it's not right I heard like it's orang eh
is it someone hantar jin or is it orang tu sendiri is the one
the what oh they send benda tu ah
actually kan aku ada question we're because hantu raya kan dia actually apa
what is it asal why is it called raya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because ada this one episode where
ada this group of students dia pergi this one area kat
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the tempat kan
uh they dia orang
I don't know if it's a bomoh but I think and then she macam advice dia orang kan dia dia she advise them about the macam pantang larang gitu and then
a'ah yang tu yang tu ha ya
apa eh oh they they call it
nananggal tak salah
no no they the it's nananggal not penanggal
eh aku tak tahu ah cause oh
oh apa they malay peninsular so sama hantu lah
it's because when I first saw it kan oh chey okay no because I thought at first it's a pontianak but then the cerita tunjukkan kan because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
ya kat singapore
aku tak pernah nampak okay okay then
which makes me wonder tau because kan dia orang patut kan they can go through
like solid objects tak boleh affect them kan tapi they get stuck
oh amal pengamal oo
tu yang aku tak faham like you would take you would pay lots of money
to apa tu get the services of
like jin dengan bomoh tapi like benda surgery kau tak nak
ya apa yang natural it's supernatural
seram ah wait then what's the purpose of the penanggal like
I know oh the I don't know what's the purpose tapi aku tahu like dekat episode tu they show
um that thing was going after the perempuan yang pregnant
I know because like one reasons is because macam like they are more vulnerable and then they are macam mana eh
like they are more vulnerable because they ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat
so they try to like steal it from them which is apa tu the baby lah it's like new life
a'ah ya ya ada ada
I mean kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua
ya itu that one just
because they they either makan the anak atau they curi the anak atau they ikat the rahim eww
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that eh dia letak garam kan tak eh garam
ya aku dengar like if you letak garam kat luar your pintu kan macam anyone ha anyone who masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda kan that benda cannot masuk rumah
maybe ah it's one of the ways ah yang ada
sirih eh
apa seh aku tak pernah dengar is it melayu punya
apa seh
oh kirakan macam
they make it into a sabun kan so senang
sambut what do you mean
eh a'ah a'ah apa tu yang the son of a peach punya cerita kan they were saying macam this hospital dia cakap
uh dia tengah beranak kan and then she saw a white figure then the nurse cakap oh that one is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
so kirakan macam kalau like you give birth
but then someone benda lain might be
cause thinking macam sebab maternity work kan like babies baru keluar
so it's seram seh but then kalau macam you are if you are in the operating room kan and then kau baru give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
oh that's why that one macam make sure kalau kau kat dalam kan you have someone like your family there so they can ha okay okay
oh but then masih baru kan the
oh ya ya ya tidur mati ah
kau tak baca doa tidur eh asal eh
oo so if it wakes you up then different story ah ha bodoh lah
but apa yang dia call it apa err it's not khayalan it's like
ya betul
the he looked up the stuff kan then he saw that actually jin dengan you cannot see jin and syaitan because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya so what happens is that because kau kena apa tu hasut kan
macam is just playing in your head so the syaitan hasut you and then kirakan they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension tau everything that exist in that dimension
ya macam that's why macam you nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak kan ya
also orang lain yang kena ah
kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita okay
wait so that's one of the ways they kacau you ah
so kirakan dia orang actually pegang kau or they just make you think that ada orang pegang kau
ha dia orang selalu buat kan macam like those supernatural punya like
ya I remember I watched the one yang kat malaysia kan where they the the whole entire team
kat luar rumah and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like baca-baca something basically like inviting the hantu gitu ah
ya but then it's like damn scary because apa tu
like the the thing will come to them right and then apa tu
macam mana eh the the pintu semua gerak and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to dia punya the team outside right
like usually when they go out they we have like a a bomoh on standby gitu ya
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like dia orang macam trembling or shivering or they say like dia orang ada rasa benda
ya why ah is it like singapore like dia orang tak kacau sangat
so you telling me that the hantu also like shifted back to the kampung then oh it became less popular eh less demand
oh I think it's because like is it like people in singapore tak practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources juga ah ya really like maybe ada memang ada lah but like
and like the pantang larang for bomoh right is more
ya it's so leceh satu and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it kan but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
like kan dia cakap tak boleh you cannot walk under the galah but then kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah kot
I I thought they use the clothes line the string tak eh
and kenapa galah like aku aku tak faham huh what's that
properties ah then what if it's made out of metal atau plastic
no bila macam those extendable galah kan that one made of metal what no meh
like you will perah the thing first what before you gantung
kau tau jemur ke apa ya
so kirakan like when you absent-mindedly walked under the galah lah ha
what's eh wait but for susuk kalau terkeluar you can just masukkan balik kan
it's macam mana eh it's it's this actual peniti kan something like that
I know like there used to be this show dekat suria where
where they show no not cerita hantu it's
err they ya ya so one of it is susuk they show like how the bomoh will masukkan the susuk then they will like oh it's sakit sikit tau so they masukkan
and then like if kalau kau histeria kan you can see the needles in your face
but then macam but they say like kalau the person who the person who masukkan
is the only person who can keluarkan
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the galah and then dia jatuh sendiri ah
it's either you cannot die or cause susah nak mati like the nazak right
but tetap can die lah so okay ah
because if you cannot die ah habis suffer like that
so tak mati ah oh take it out
the kafan and everything
ya but it's like you tangan semua
bodoh sejuk siol
dah lah tak tak pakai stokin
wait so they don't they don't bury you with kain batik kain batik is before kan
the funeral right oh chey ya so kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik ah
nasi lemak oh tak ah no no no because kan
kalau kau dah keluarkan the
batik kan would you want to still use the batik
atau like the the the soil wouldn't stay right ya
err she said like ni orang-orang dulu kata ah macam if you are at the funeral kan jangan diri depan kaki mayat because in case kalau bukan-bukan kalau like the person pernah ada simpan barang kan they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is ah but
ya but I thought like kalau
so if like they ask you ya that's what I thought ah my mum you supposed to pass the thing bila dia masa hidup kan not bila dah mati
no as in the roof is what boleh buka oh okay okay okay
oh my god my mum like the interview she said like uh she would work right and then she would take leave then when her ask when her friends asked her like eh you took leave where you go the she said I won't go I'm gonna stay home and gosok baju and then aku macam ya she did I was like then what do you do for fun no lah I just stay home ah if my friends invite me maybe we go
like watch movie or what but after that I come back home I take leave so that I can wash everyone's clothes at home lah gosok baju semua because ya
ya and then like it's not like dua tiga orang tau like in the house there's like ten plus people I'm like why
hari raya also coming in
macam uh macam apa itu I I I apa corak apa tema yang you nak
you just tampal lah
apa concept you nak
uh apa kayu jenis-jenis kayu you nak
uh jenis lantai
err jampi serapah ke
inspirasi macam err tema
tema contemporary atau tema
WhatsApp WhatsApp uh yang group renovation itu

dah tengok juga lah ada baca-baca juga
ada ada design yang I suka juga
uh itu I dah
I dah hantar pada you mana yang I suka mana
apa itu design yang I suka you suka dapur corak yang macam mana
tapi kalau open concept itu
jangan jangan letak apa itu kena ada letak partition juga seperti gelas lah
jadi bila kalau you nak masak
ah tak ada minyak itu tak berasap ke seluruh rumah
ya betul
err orang yang orang yang apa itu membersihkan
mm dan dan apa itu
menggunakan uh vacuum special
I think beliau bercakap
dia cakap memang kotor ah macam minyak itunya bila dah bersih
kan air dia kan warna warna coklat
warna hitam ah kotor juga lah
then I macam I uh hari itu I bilang you lah kalau I nak you masak
nanti I boleh order menerusi ruangan yang ruangan lubang itu lah
nanti kalau I nak letak loceng
jadi bila I nak panggil you sayang
I picit loceng yang itu
no lah you not my waiter tapi
so you hari itu you cakap you nak you nak
uh harga quotation itu berapa so kalau within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack ke or
or total hack ke
so itu kita kena tanya
kita punya lah what will be the quotation
you cakap you nak nak nak hack certain areas
dekat the platform
whether it's whether kalau within kita punya budget ah
ya uh ya platform itu pun dah
so kena tanya lah kalau kita nak hack and then nak pasang a new
baru punya platform
ah berapa akan quote kita
platform memang platform memang mahal
ah so kena
kalau kalau tengok lah tengok budget kalau macam terover
maybe just hack and just letak vinyl
letak vinyl
tambah tambah platform
oh dekat uh
uh dia ambil dari mana
bagus juga lah you ada survey survey tengok-tengok jadi you ada idea lah
ah nak nak nak
nak buat uh renovation lah nanti
it anyway tingkap itu pun kita tak akan buka
kita akan tutup what sebab you selalu takut ada binatang selalu masuk ke apa
I think yang yang yang sliding door okay yang yang yang sliding
sebab kita pun bukannya nak nak nak buka kan kita akan tutup jer
ah dia dah dah haus benda pun dah lama kan
uh so ada juga ah ada ada banyak juga design
nanti I I I ambil gambar dan kita tengok bila kat daerah sini ada ada cantik juga
dia punya apa itu dia punya tingkap macam ah style condo condo style
very nice cantik
you can consider tapi tengok lah harga dia berapa
is what kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil
sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati ah dengan rumah kita macam
dia tak dia pandai tau dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab
kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak err
dengan err apa itu
dengan spray spray pencuci lantai semua
uh memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan
err letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi
time kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai
berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang is err isteri ya lah macam biasa lah isteri kalau
uh itu dia akan
ah ya lah faham-faham lah kalau
kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham lah nanti apa isteri akan buat kan
memang uh ya lah I understand lah your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
the kitchen the kitchen apa itu
who halfway uh merajuk and don't want to come
ya lah dia dia ini
you know like malas-malas to to come
so emotional then merajuk
ya macam I bilang you lah uh err kita kasi dia orang arrange
kita kasi arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah sebab kita
mungkin will markup
or work kita punya budget so kita kasi them
arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah
actually ya lah macam lampu ini semua kita dah
uh kita dia punya cost itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi ah
uh banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga lah kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga
so I mean sekarang ini yang the more yang lebih
tengok lah macam mana berapa dia orang akan quote
macam uh the the other time I I I
I tanya quotation ya lah macam toilet itu toilet itu kalau dua toilet
kurang-kurang pun at least satu toilet pun at least maybe three four K
dua toilet is around lapan K just toilet
itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk kitchen dapur bahagian sana lah sekaligus ah
tak yang yang bilik tak yang master bedroom vinyl kita almost thousand
thousand four thousand ah seribu lima seribu
apa yang bilik bilik master kita nak buka
agaknya lah
kalau nak ya lah kalau nak buat memang
memang I murah sikit lah tapi I think leceh ah
tak apa lah bayar lebih sikit biar the biar yang yang yang the experts
ya tapi bilik ini dia punya flooring
yes dia sejuk panas sejuk panas ha tengok ini dah merekah lah
that yang yang
dia merekah nanti jadi macam ah master bedroom ah sebelum sebelum itu kan macam masuk air semua kan nanti itu dah sebab sebelah
sebelah toilet itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah
sampai menggelembung eh
ini ini bukan ya ini bukan yang
I don't think this the ini vinyl yang
so so so tengok lah
kalau master bedroom we do it around berapa eh thousand
so kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin
oh mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya estimate nya
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate lah tapi that time kita pun kita punya budget pun tak banyak kan so kita buat yang yang urgent dulu lah
sejuk ah
kalau ada ada baby baru ke so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety dia tak keras sangat
kalau jatuh pun at least dia ada macam uh cushion this vinyl kan underneath dia ada cushion kan
then tak sejuk sangat
kitchen punya flooring
yang yang I I saw one of the picture you send
with the kitchen punya
but uh ya the one that we saw kak doro using I think wah
tak ingat seh I think like since COVID about
asal kau ketawa ah kau teringat something ah ni kan mesti
a'ah that time yang aku video call kau tu lah yang kau ingat tak what happen that time
tu ah
kerja aku rabak juga ah like because I don't know whether
um kerja aku recently buang orang like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left semua nak kena buat you know pick up the slack abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat
everything can be done via the laptop lah but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to apa tu collect dia punya physical mails
eh aku tak boleh imagine sia like I will I cannot even you know
both of us ada short attention span and like to have
abeh like you can't even like focus and
banyak orang juga like you know stress eat
I see I will check that out I think one day aku check it out
oh that's fun speaking of joget recently also like literal you know literally yesterday err me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through macam dance punya youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing kan kau you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to kau buat like um
HIIT workouts I mean that works better lah because you know it's a specific punya macam err they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then um she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to apa tu download
this thing err this game apa just dance eh ya so we've had we've yet to try that err it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
like you feel more refreshed abeh nanti kau tak feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time err always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
I'm not one to preach but it is important lah cause now also zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang all fast food and things like that you know as compared to zaman dulu kan they're more much more
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes pun jadi ah
highly ambitious niat tu ada but selalu tak kesampaian like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday macam berangan ah like macam kau nak oh berangan nak jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour ah
and then lepas tu start the start my day right you know working and then like macam feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said ah tadi you just have to be consistent ah
kena monitor ah
ya like macam if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you macam tak nampak so tired or worn out tau
aku memang suka like dark err like because I don't know like
entah eh macam tak lawa sangat ah
ya I hang it like macam fairy lights around dia punya ni ah my my bedroom punya frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it lah and then macam because I prefer to use like macam candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that kalau fairy lights when you switch it on kan
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings ah different modes that you can choose from like macam those like blinking ones or like macam alah you know macam lampu lap lip lah basically
ya I use it is dia macam aurora lights
no lah I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep lah bila aku nak you know feeling spa day nak relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
bila aku nyanyi ya bila aku nyanyi nak feeling feeling
a'ah eh berapa lama eh kita dah kawan
kat gek poh ah
two yes tapi K one
K one yang dekat err mmhmm uh huh
sama eh
tak ingat seh but I know it's
memang confirm primary school lah but I don't know whether it's like primary five mother tongue eh ke apa
oh apa eleven
tak tahu it's like literally after school it's not
ah eh speaking of which tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun like literally random ah like aku tak rapat dengan dia pun like tu pun aku that time kerja part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then err kita tak contact pun and then after that random after few years aku jumpa dia dekat err tioman island ke apa then random gila then lepas tu we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to bali and then I met her again just now so macam random lah like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to macam like meet them often but
oh ah tu pun random seh kau pun pergi trip dengan dia juga
anyway speaking of which how's your love life dah lama aku tak dengar apa any anything new that you want to talk to me about
the last time kau cakap dengan aku dia
something about his throat eh sakit ke apa
rajin seh kau
you know macam you gave so much um care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return lah kau ikhlas memang but
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like macam it's one sided like you
you know then bila kau sakit tangan ni semua I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so macam he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like macam all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
err it is all about compromising and macam if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
then entah eh do you really think it's worth it then
a lot of things like macam
aww dia blue tick kau oh dia seen kau oh my god
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes dia yang paling decent
if you may never know mana tahu
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know um but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so kau just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head kan bila kau like you know
late at night kau tak boleh tidur thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually ah you don't like macam don't don't make it obligatory for him
kau tanya jer
and then kau action ah treat him for his birthday or what
bila birthday dia
oh dekat tu
tak ah kau action macam oh my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
ya or um no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like err jual mahal but at the same time like hey you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
err do you have any plans macam a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like macam err let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to err do you have any plans macam like secretly hoping him would to say yes
kau set reminder set reminder
dia sama age dengan kita eh oh
an hour we should like start a podcast or something lah it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also lah dah lama kita tak jumpa kan and and it's like so good to to finally you know
you know kat belakang and not at the front so
love life aku boleh like you can literally write a book out of it man
my nonsense my lain my love life lain
same same thing same thing about my work tempat kerja err like my workplace
it's like err the shift timing and all is like change dah tukar semua so we like have to adapt lah ah then
around seven to four and then that's for the morning shift then the afternoon shift will start about four err four fifteen to one fifteen lah and now we change to four macam around
then apart from that also I think design macam like for social media ah poster ya uh macam gitu ah
so uh so cerita apa
you like what what you watch dekat netflix
ah I see uh I see ever since uh apa after COVID then I think like netflix release quite a lot of err nice nice err movie or series and
an italian cafe ah you know dekat bali lane eh ah bali lane ya
err macam sedap ah ya ya
better to macam reserve lah
watch a catch a movie ke apa ya really
like normal lah temperature taking and all then err you you have to be seated err macam just staggered sitting
you kind of have a extra privacy ah sort of ah that kind ya tu ah
I think kan macam
kalau orang itu err okay lah let's let's say macam nak buat plans kan
um macam my my friends wants to make a plan or plan out something and then lepas itu
we already like so into it already then then after that like suddenly last minute they want to cancel lah ini itu lah then ya that that kinds of err annoys me ah
ah suka advance planning tak suka macam last minute ah
ah macam my off days also you need to consider ah
tu ah then how about you
oh okay ya I I mean like it's true lah like macam you're not being yourself err not being true to yourself lah can say
certain things ah macam minor I don't know
like you know do do you still keep in contact with your like macam primary school friends ke secondary school friends like
who who is among your friends yang lama kenal ya still keep in touch
apa eh like they are not
then semua ada like ya like married and stuff ya so macam
my secondary school friend I still I still in contact and one of them is also like I'm I'm in a I'm in a band so ya so macam
macam like even now tengah tengah susah kan like some I think some of my friend also dah hilang kerja ah kena buang ah kena buang
so dia orang macam susah lah
kesian ah ya
so I heard kan you suka you like indo music right
so macam huh indo I can see from your face lah you look you look like the kind lah
macam gitu ah
ya yes yes especially tengah hujan ke apa so wah best mm
very err macam mana nak cakap
mm tapi tak lah macam teruk sangat macam
err heavy metal ke apa ke macam gitu no lah ya but
I also like macam kalau time macam hujan ke
macam time malam-malam I also like to listen to macam post rock you know like instrumental lah gitu ya
like very very dia macam macam
just playing err guitar for example guitar or piano ah macam gitu lah
then dia macam ah ah macam lena ah terlena ya
oh start up business takde lah takde lah apa apa business pun macam okay lah err
it's just a macam err small service lah can say macam kita kita buat err this err apa eh
macam you know is in indo I think it's stands for
like like ah let's say people macam request for something
in indonesia they they want it in singapore so we can request from there ah macam service gitu ah
like macam anything ah from snacks ke err makanan ke or err baju-baju
ah sebab I think kan pasal pandemic pasal COVID then kita dah tak boleh pergi indonesia ke nak pergi negeri mana-mana
I like suddenly macam struck an idea like to go and
err apa
like we can we can use this service or people can use this service untuk err apa
um bring bring food or bring apa-apa lah like snacks ke apa to singapore lah like they can macam some
macam ada orang dia orang rindu makanan-makanan indo then dia orang macam uh teringin ah nak makan
actually it's just three months aje lah ya we are still in our macam trial trial run lah kita tengah tengok macam mana err dia punya demand and people's punya response semua macam mana
and dia orang kalau happy
willing to venture out more lah macam venture in
ya like I think this is now macam a good opportunity untuk kita buat
such a business sebab
sebab kita kan
dah tak boleh travel
business I think mainly macam communication ah dengan ah like liaise
language barrier ada sikit ah pasal dia orang kan berbual bahasa so ada certain things kita tak faham then kadang miscommunication juga macam kita nak cakap satu benda dia orang interpret as something else
then uh tu tu one of the difficulties lah
then lepas tu macam err
sebab kita kan tak boleh ada there
then lepas tu
macam err we we
ah ah ya ya ya sekarang susah eh
ah we go sekarang mm that's why
like some now nowadays you nak beli groceries you pun macam susah I mean like you kena err cut down cost lah
kan selalu kalau tak boleh pergi ke apa just to buy our necessities then sekarang dah susah ah sebab barang-barang kat supermarket semua mahal seh then
hopefully lah inshallah ada mm
err first thing eh actually mm mungkin I want to go morocco
a'ah morocco one of the place then lepas tu satu lagi dekat new zealand
new zealand ya uh those two are depends not really dah lama but I think is err one of the beautiful places kan
but I I've I never I've never been to like err macam mana eh like those kind of err moroccan kind of err you know country ya yang macam ada those kind of architecture ya
so it's quite interesting lah untuk tengok semua ya
I suka macam tengok permandangan mm macam gunung-gunung
err macam gitu lah
ya sebab err
it's very beautiful lah kan like ya I I I've actually new zealand I've been to I dah pergi norway
ya uh uh uh so macam is is such a beautiful place lah
ya so then like like I think new zealand is also one of the one of it also so macam
that's why nak experience it lah
mmhmm macam very ya macam very chill and then lepas tu santai-santai ah
actually kalau macam new zealand kalau kita sewa macam caravan kan
I I think boleh consider lah parents macam err elderly ke orang-orang
yang susah macam kurang upaya ah macam gitu ah dia orang macam err okay ah they can just macam duduk dalam caravan tu
lepas tu relax
relax sahaja
so macam
I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience untuk orang-orang macam dia orang ah kan macam actually my parents pun dah berumur juga
my parents pun bukannya pergi
jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun err indonesia
ah ah so indonesia punya view
indonesia punya view dia macam lain kan dengan new zealand new zealand macam ah then also dia punya climate pun
err lain ada sejuk sikit ya mm mm mm
mm correct macam I rasa
kita kan orang melayu kan so kita punya apa lidah or something eh our taste buds lah macam mesti kena ada pedas ah macam gitu or mesti ada
sambal ke apa ke err kalau macam bland ke macam let's say pergi western punya country macam makan pasta ke makan macam cream cream or cheese mm tak semua orang macam melayu suka kan macam ah sambal tumis lah ah apa
ya lah different perception macam orang pergi dengan parents mana pergi dengan
kawan pun macam mana kan ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's sebab sebab err
sebab apa kita macam err sometimes kalau okay lah like when we were young
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that lah but with friends ah you have to consider all of these things lah budgeting lah apa all that
like when that time I went to err europe ah then I experience the snow and all so it was err quite fun like you can have snowball fights semua ya then like you do all the silly silly things lah ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore kan
ya so but err how to say macam the aesthetic
uh I think jackets at least we can still save lah for our next few trips ke apa ya ya hopefully get to experience again
err oh ya okay dah pernah pergi lah ya I went before uh once ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like huh korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of macam
orang dia you know macam like the the people there are really polite
polite gila like they
mm you should try the apa
err I'm not really but depends lah on the circumstances macam if you ask me to go skydiving err part of me would want but part of me will be scared lah of course ya cause like I'm that that afraid
ya I think I I don't I cannot I cannot even bunuh that spider because
ya so eventually I think we just let it be we just macam like throw things at it and slowly the spider went out of the house
tak lah tak ada lah ya ya ya ya this one I think can say quite
not not so hairy lah the normal tipis but but it looks it's like the size of my palm lah around there
cockroach dah mati bare hands tak boleh lah cockroach is quite dirty
macam kan
dia punya kulit tu macam keras then like I don't know I cannot tak boleh imagine macam mana orang makan
orh maybe when lepas dia orang dah kukus then dia jadi
lembut sikit lah is it
by the way foodpanda helmet masih ada tak
ingatkan nak pergi ambil besok ramai orang masa tu uh queue untuk ambil helmet
takpe lah by the way ada kerja kosong tak
okay nanti bila hari isnin ke apa bilang ayah lah
macam abang azri pun boleh if not depends ah uh similar to my intern kot
oh by the way then our family this month ada apa-apa plan tak

ah biar lah asal dia orang dua bahagia lah
a'ah uh engineering informatics yes betul
dia punya is more on
uh engineer punya side more on not say maintenance dia punya more on testings
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one uh ya yang test setakat masuk setakat duduk from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad lah the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like abang azhar on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well ah he he works at dia kerja kat jurong uh water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level uh when it rises when it lowers err which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview uh every uh mostly entire of singapore like know the longkang and stuff like that
okay lah not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause dia masih dia orang sponsor dia orang sponsor dia sambung belajar
a'ah dia tengah ambil part time diploma
ya dia tengah ambil kat uh singapore poly because near to his workplace ya bayar sampai bayar sampai habis uh second year ke atau I forget I never got
but tengok lah macam mana
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know uh you know they ride by they saman people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle ah like one my friend she intan at uh hers is under
dia bantai jer gaji dia besar
I mean kalau pun not bad uh dia sampai what two let's say you habis two forty five you extend what pukul lima pukul enam then after that
ya I think so oh ya ya yang tadi kita berbual-bual
ya ke ingat oh
five to seven lima ke lima tujuh ribu depends
huh murahnya
tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang uh
huh sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang clutch housing kadang-kadang bearing kat dalam engine kadang-kadang piston banyak benda yang akan effect your bike
ya lah me lah I mean ha kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya ya tapi the reason I want to use is ayie's not say lumba your bike considered
untuk budak-budak err bawa motor nakal tapi you bawak terus jadi motor apek
okay lah kalau gitu how about kita share
apa X one apa uh oh oh class two A ke class two B oh two hundred oh
tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat carpark
okay lah cuma at the same time nak kata nak kata sayang tapi
tak boring ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh
kesedapan at the same time untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa motor boleh jam boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu
got a bit lepak ah in a way so he thought want to earn more money
no he he he was dead serious dia betul-betul uh dig through everything asking me macam
uh all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab apa dia punya benefit apa dia punya you know uh
apa uh akan jadi kalau gini gini semua so I ceritakan dia lah I was uh apa tu
I bilang dia macam
okay kalau foodpanda leceh dia kita kena book shift kalau deliveroo dengan grab uh anytime kita boleh start boleh offline
uh antara ni tiga company tak semestinya uh masing-masing ada uh dia punya
benefit dia tapi at the same time ya lah he tak boleh cerewet lah kita kena banyak sabar because
I pernah tunggu one hour for just one makanan so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
dia macam dia macam okay jer macam
boleh jer tapi at the same time tak tahu lah pasal motor tu kan pun under ayah
pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula so okay lah pros and cons ah siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi understand lah maybe back then his workload was too much in a way lah pasal dia kata uh
ada budak baru masuk this and that so macam workload dia macam kurang tapi macam spread uh evenly ah so untuk dia
uh advantage ah pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya shift lagi dia ada pagi atau petang so that time dia pernah tanya lah macam
uh dia ada bilang dia punya uh cadangan dia kalau dia buat
kalau dia kena pagi punya shift lepas habis pagi dia dia uh ha dia buat delivery dia dia kayuh daripada
uh lepas maghrib ah sampai malam
tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak lah dah cakap dah uh dia cakap senang ah pakai bag kau abang tak payah beli so you know lah your brother macam mana eh
huh ya lah dia dia berbual kat orang jer ah cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak lah
ya tapi tak tahu lah I mean dia sendiri that time nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli padahal dulu dia ada yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak problem this and that so I don't get his point ah
pasal tak tahu lah dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar oh ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka you know tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham ah dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia
dia tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik motor bagi kat ayah so dia beli motor sendiri after dah berapa tahun ya dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu lah dia
uh huh dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul
tak pasti ah tu kena tanya ayah mmhmm mungkin kot
then oh then that time apa abang ada tanya
uh he he dia tanya akak kerja grabfood macam mana mmhmm then I said lah macam gitu lah dia I uh I say lah the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then dia terus bingit ah dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang lah kau panas baran macam gini macam mana
tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki how
tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena viral jer
ya ada yang that time punggol budak-budak grab gaduh dengan vendor pasal tak tahu sabar I think it was some promotion lah then I think
ya jangan jadi viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
oh oh ya my friend my friend kerja roo uh this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot lah even though
I mean kita dah layan hujan habis
bayar sikit jer you know so for roo to do that I'm very amazed lah
oh tak distance dia memang dia dia add on tapi ni dia tambah lagi because dia orang perasan somehow I think orang complain pasal hujan then you know safety and stuff so at least
worth it and you know macam berbaloi ah
ya for roo macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas so if compared to grab I have to take three orders tapi three orders pun tak semestinya I can get within less than one hour
ya waktu
macam tak masuk akal no she didn't she wasn't aware until I tell her ya because she works err when she wants she was so she's not really depending on grab but she just if you just work for the fun of but ya when I tell her this so for her to do actually heard about this to her she find it like she pity for the other riders who get affected by this ah because it's considered their rice work ah
bukan bukan apa zina cakap pasal terrorists ini semua
and this is why dia shouldn't come in yet
okay kejap so dia orang actually sudah kenal berapa lama
dua tahun they know of each other for two years okay
oh habis yang budak ini dia duduk dekat yang the couch yang facing apa
ah dia duduk dia duduk dekat the mirror side lah yang facing the living room there right
so dia memang uh friend of a friend is it
tak tak penting ah
ya and then dia cakap
so dia dia kalau police dia kalau finish a certain number of years bond dia dapat yang bonus itu kan
he's and and so he's actually macam upfront and really just
apa yang susah sangat yang izat tak habis-habis yang macam cakap ah habis kau nak tanya dia punya gaji semua kau nak interrogate kan tak payah tanya budak ini sendiri cakap
eh merepek eh
so what happen you tanya first ah
apasal kena dekat istighfar eh
ya lah tapi pasir ris pun ada yang akan datang apa
nak cepatkan kahwin dia ah
he still thinks it it was the right thing to do itu ah
ya allah okay so oh tak tapi ini yang ini yang revise punya plan kan
yang mak dia cakap nak dua tahun kan tapi kalau tapi dia cakap ah the original plan
duh itu yang kita cakap kan
oh my god susah benda ini sudah jadi so complicated in the last three weeks
habis you tak tanya mm pasal kenapa nak kahwin sekarang tak tak tak tanya tu
zina pun nak kena grow up ah dua dua dua
habis budak itu tak cakap apa-apa at this mmhmm
grow grow up masing-masing
huh maksud apa
oh okay maksud dia macam dia cakap macam dia cakap lepas kahwin pun boleh grow up macam how zina puts it ah lepas kahwin pun can still do this
but I I don't know how much dia orang faham of this growing up thing I think macam fikir macam oh it's just about career future entah lah
mama duduk mana kat sini
mama dekat kitchen apasal mama dekat kitchen huh
oh habis
did you say macam jangan sembunyi-sembunyi did you say that
ah habis dia okay jer
macam dia the leader lah you can quite see that there will be the the nature
so memang dia dua puluh lima ah
entah lah
habis you tak tanya pasal dia punya family
oh I know the the dekat there okay ya I was there last time
habis zina macam mana dia punya reaction malu-malu ah tersipu-sipu ah
habis dia tengok macam alim-alim type tak
ini lepas si ashraf itu sudah balik ah habis
habis this is when
mm habis
habis then you say
supporting lah ya dayah yang kena support lah
ah habis apasal taxi driver
tapi dayah but oh my lord macam like
dayah is at the stage of her life that she's driven and macam have a lot of aspiration
habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia educated ke atau dia kaya ke at the end he's just going to be having this err aura of like macam relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah eh uh tak payah lah berbual pasal ini okay lepas itu
macam it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband lagi worse kalau dia have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character ke apa if he has it okay that macam he might ask dayah to stop working and things like that lah
habis so you just say that ah
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya dia nak kena match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand pasal
this whole like family who yang macam oh tahu benda orang orang I don't know family ke sesiapa ah yang rasa
oh lebih baik err halalkan percepatkan
macam as if macam itu ikut sunah nabi okay they take that part of the sunah nabi of marriage but the other part of the sunah nabi of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like macam your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody yang macam that macam is complementary to like your personality
mana boleh macam like that ah ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack err macam complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see macam that is the thing that orang just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part nak kahwin cepat macam oh ah ikut sunah nabi percepatkan but part part lain macam
to get somebody that is competent with you ini semua tak tak ambil kira ah
uh anyway this boy the call you abang or what
he should be comfortable with it lah dia ada kakak apa
oh so that's when he call you abang ah
so the conversation dengan zina err bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar it's more of like what what did you say to zina pasal yang the growing up and then pasal pasal making a apa plan habis pasal apa lagi like what else did you address
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this ah kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena wake up music just just just use this card
kata nak kahwin kan orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu tengok sampai perempuan agaknya she will just be fed up one day tapi betul apa macam
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect macam do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
easy go easy uh macam mana nak cakap uh ah apa
itu tak ada pendirian lah maksudnya
no macam gini the thing yang dia nak kena differentiate is ada bezanya easy-going dan tak ada haluan this is the thing zina you are which one
easy-going atau actually you are directionless
you said that ah untuk si ashraf ini ah habis ashraf cakap apa
ah budak ini pun tahu ke tak the background of zina
so this easily two years baru meet up tahu
I mean yes macam I am thankful and it's nice to know budak ini budak baik err so like what izat say kau tengok jer lah budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia
ya lah ya tapi I don't want after this izat say huh kau tengok macam aku cakap
dia budak baik I hope izat doesn't go like this lah ya but anyway
entah lah don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
sambil lewa anyway what I was saying okay
I really don't know lah this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes macam to
push zina tapi I don't know if at the end of this product is zina will be
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want macam at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all zina loses dia punya identity because this she is she is macam dissolving into a very
ah it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia see that I don't know lah sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if macam she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that macam you know like ah a woman shall be like macam be led by a man that kind of thing and
at because at some point there will be a point that macam she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
no it's not say tak lepas tangan it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse faham
macam because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself tau this twentieth uh twenty some age
but dayah said yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang denmark itu
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff orang punya personal is to us superficial
then you tak cakap macam dengan zina
at the end of the day zina dayah is still your sister macam you know she still cares for you lah then you know like
maybe she you tak cakap lah why why didn't you say to zina tadi like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu
then bila you cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini mama and abah was there habis
apasal you cannot chat ini
my why is my recoding still err okay you continue kejap kejap ya my recording is kind of
dia ah habis nevermind lepas itu then she say what dia tak cakap apa-apa
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to izat ever since macam she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
and just because izat is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue lah cuba kalau the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat will be supportive pasal apa
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that macam don't say that
you are macam ah tapi ah it's not that she will see all this point
habis if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
habis cakap you're close to izat pergi lah suruh izat tolong ah
budak ni segan silu wow
but that's because dia orang don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to tolong them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it lah
but it's hard lah I mean it's also vary in age age difference macam I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
oh you also cannot engineer it what salim like macam you cannot be bringing the two of them together
habis expect dia orang macam uh to boleh berbual like at a very deep level mana boleh like it will also feel it's so janggal macam it was so it was just feel so weird lah
siapa lah
where there's me then baru ada
hmm dah macam dah macam project
hmm tak suka
I suka especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
tourist stuff dekat Sentosa
wait but you dah beli belum dia punya ticket
cari online ah I think ada yang ada twenty five per cent off eh
it's not so much the beach lah because you all are going to macam tempat tempat the attraction right
that's at Marina Bay punya tempat
you know the one yang kita pergi Marina Barrage itu hari oh because you took Jihan punya car um
before you sampai Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
ada air-con tak
alah are you going malam or pagi
oh ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau
yang your own is
oh tak de tentage ah
sebab kalau nak tentage you can take mine
orh ya lah I mean is at one corner lah if that's what you want kalau you nak orang tak kacau then okay lah
ours was quite open dia exposed ah so
uh given the circumstances I think that's not bad lah but I think I saw some of them duduk dekat nearer to the lift area that one tak kena panas sangat
but pernah tak
ya kalau tak pernah then better don't
Seah Im kat luar lah park kat luar
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him jangan bawa motosikal because if he doesn't bring his bike then dia rasa macam
asal eh normally we ya
but muka girlfriend dia muka poker face tak is it she can ah
following each other's plan can but kalau the partner like me like that last minute say don't want ah I want today I got I got cramp ah I decide not to go to Sentosa then habis
because marina barrage dia punya jauh tau
because because Sentosa tak ada kereta senang that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
I seriously think that's a good idea too because Sentosa nak keluar pun leceh
cable car then yang Carlsberg tu
yang pusing pusing the thing that pusing
then apa sia yang lima
I went I don't think I've been to the one yang dekat Singapore
Hong Kong I went to Bangkok tak salah eh with my husband once
but ya you share with me ah I also want to see eh since my staycation dah kena cancel kan so
ya then you make him jalan also
but I'm pretty sure dia penat from going for kelas mengaji okay that's wrong but
dia kat mana dia dekat  bukan Tampines
because kalau daripada Tampines actually it's a bit more difficult lah dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang kan
I see oh it's not like she go and jumpa him somewhere and then they
yeah ni macam papa lah
oh last entry dia bukan tutup last entry
bukan tutup so that means uh last
last entrance normally tutup one hour later ah
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because susah you really have to macam tak de
tak ada secrets out
berapa orang sia
for eleven that's mahal leh
um nasi goreng tom yum
you have to see you know whether you have to make oh but because it's a hawker centre tak yah buat reservation ah
habis lah
I think kalau
potluck ah macam picnic style ah
ya if satay by the bay let's say penuh nak mams kan then you find in that area apa lagi kedai makan [ah]
cuma now we are not at Sentosa if you at Sentosa then ada banyak options ah
dekat Vivo banyak apa makanan
no oh my god dorang ni
nasib Zaki beli berapa banyak water bottle dia beli I think about
enam tujuh ada mineral water
because now the weather like sekejap panas sekejap sejuk
sekejap panas then the next thing hujan
oh dia kulit tebal lah
korang tiga orang aje eh
no si
Shad sama sama group kan
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dia macam one committee and then within the committee ada macam sub sub group ah
I can so dengan dia
ya ya ya ya ya ya I can see the long hair guy right dia punya muka macam
ya ya ya you told me also lah it hit on the wrong timing you say if it's next month maybe boleh consider lah
then kau sorang serious ah
ya that one we got no other eh unless you want to bring the the bapa and the anak and the
that time ah I see my friend pergi
like err kosong the whole you know where the
the one that they always do uh free dance dia macam dance on the road gitu
dia ada the road ah
that one dia pergi kosong lah
oh ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me dia orang kena buang kerja
don't know I don't know you pay me also belum tentu I naik
like you know the restaurant yang no the restaurant yang ada kereta kereta tu lah the vintage car
cannot cannot be I tak kerja right I think baru start kerja kot
was it was it berapa bulan ah
oh I belum pakai tudung so that means yeah ya ya I belum pakai tudung so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
first trimester is supposed to be like uh they say what belum melekat yet
the flower one dah habis
rezeki don't tolak
rezeki dah ketuk kat pintu knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
orh dia tak kaku dia tak awkward lah
wait dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah
lurus bendul lah that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
not lurus bendul I think dia tak nonsense ah
uh lurus
and that's the reason why dia kena avoid orang orang yang macam hypocrite
a bit meh panas baran
no no this this is what that darah muda
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know dah besar anak mak
once dia masuk primary school ah
you bloom into a minah or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
yeah I took a nerd path come on then balik lambat
apa people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan
bila sia the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I jumpa kat Tampines mart
you know the McDonald's punya carpark masuk right ya ya ya ya
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come jalan
not like macam accident every day also like that that one not accident already
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he sengaja he never
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he tutup
then we run to the main gate masuk
no no no I cannot study at home nanti pergi library ah oh standard
sampai library pukul sepuluh lari book seat
sampai pukul dua belas dua belas lebih satu between that time
dinner after after study at night we go for supper huh tengok

he didn't allow us to go in tutup
let's go cabut cabut come let's
cabut I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
the first guy said naik naik naik naik we went out
maju lah she she's
uh ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time lah since dah kena marked also right we
I think second last day ya then we walk okay ah kena buat detention first time in my life ah kena detention know then I was like
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health lah kesian budak ni ah bila bila bila
okay babe I ada soalan I nak tanya you kalau COVID nineteen benda ni semua dah selesai
kita tak perlu susah payah nak quarantine ke nak stay home notice ke nak risau tentang leave kita cukup ke tidak you rasanya you nak pergi mana holiday kalau boleh
bulan bulan march err tahun ni ke atau tahun
oh tahun ni
oh okay tapi you dah beli air ticket ke belum
AirAsia ke Singapore Airlines
oh okay tapi kalau depa dah refund sepatutnya okay lah
I ada dengar juga kawan I cakap AirAsia tak boleh refund langsung atau partial refund atau
you know maybe they will just macam postpone lah their trip sampai tak tahu lah bila
tapi kalau okay japan ni you pernah pergi ke tidak atau ni kali pertama
mm dah lima kali okay
so then tapi okinawa is first time atau bukan
ya so I rasa macam kalau boleh kan quarantine ni dah selesai tak perlu susah payah macam ni sangkut dalam rumah
I nak pergi jumpa boyfriend I sebab
kan kita ni memang long distance relationship dah kan tapi lapan bulan dah tak jumpa
kalau boleh I nak gi perth lah sebab I rasa macam
perth ni bila I gi kat situ um
selalunya rasa macam very peaceful
kacau I
so I can like eat and sleep and relax or maybe because I'm on leave juga lah
so tak rasa macam stressed sangat
oh betul ke tapi australia you pernah pergi ke tak
okay boleh juga ajak you lah ah okay lah
so ya so I pernah pergi ke sydney sekali
melbourne sekali yang dua-dua kali dengan mum I lah dengan my mak
sekali dengan mak I juga and then I've been to perth I think this time dah kira the third time lah
next year kalau boleh I nak gi lah tapi
because sekarang
kan australia punya borders err rasa rasanya dalam Berita Harian  dah tertulis
they tutup sampai
tahun twenty twenty one
oh betul ke and you tak pernah visit
you should you should so then macam mana dengan
person that suka holiday suka keluar err
for new adventure tengok new adventure see new things so during
err tahun ni kan semasa lockdown uh semasa COVID you ada rasa macam you
you suffocating a bit ke tak like you know um like you cannot go on holiday you ada rasa macam mana
during circuit breaker at that time I was renting my room dengan ni house mates I
and at that time there was like five of us in the house so tak rasa macam lonely sangat lah
because sebelum ni kan
you memang tahu I tak tahu
memasak langsung so I didn't know how to cook um nasi pun tak tahu lor so then it's like
susah sikit lah
then I had to macam ask
I was very lucky that during the lockdown I tinggal dengan mereka lah at that time ah
boleh boleh makan lah but then there was this one time bila I masak uh kari ikan
salmon salmon I okay boleh makan tapi curry dia I think sebab I added too much water
so rasa dia macam air instead of or is rasa dia macam salmon soup instead of salmon curry lah
hais you tahu tak hari tu because I'm thinking to myself
that you ni kan memang drive and I take public transportation
so I was thinking hari tu kan you know outside rumah I ni I was sleeping very soundly by myself and you know just
dia accident
betapa kuatnya I heard bang
and I was like apa jadi ah
look out the window but then tak nampak apa apa then kawan I ternampak
memang yang accident tu teruk lah dengan motosikal
then kereta depan dia memang hempas sampai the whole thing is spoilt lah
kemek already crash already lah
ya so then after that few minutes later you can terdengar lah ambulance tu
ah betul
mm betul tapi you pernah kena accident tak
so far pernah
okay pas tu
wah kereta dia terbakar
I rasa macam I ada nampak
video tu kan I think ya no bukan nampak kereta dia kat tampines tapi I think I rasa I nampak video dia kat TikTok
sebab biasanya usually kalau ada accident kat singapore ke apa apa yang terjadi dia akan upload dalam TikTok
so macam tu lah so talking about the news um do you follow tak the the punya politician semua
mm I nampak tapi I macam tak faham
faham lah
sepatutnya I nak pergi shopping tapi I rasa macam hais
you know kena save money lah
and then you know uh tapi I rasa macam the houses here pun sekarang
getting more expensive and kalau tak I kena you know buy like somewhere further away from the city and it's not convenient sebab I tak pandu kereta kan
so macam tu lah eh you ada siblings ke tak
oh I tak tahu pun you ada siblings
okay so your big brother buat apa
tak ada lah I ni kan only child
so that's why that's why like you know my parents I kena take care of them lah
so that's why during this COVID nineteen time I worried sikit lah sebab kan they are walking around in singapore
I takut lah kalau ada apa apa yang jadi especially bila that time when the domestic workers the numbers were increasing and
you tahu lah parents ni tua-tua yang semua tua-tua ni kan
bila kita bagi tahu jangan keluar dari rumah sebab sekarang ni kan COVID dangerous especially if you are high risk
risiko tinggi kan jangan lah keluar sebab
macam diabetes high cholesterol
err like macam mak I she's had a stroke before it's it's dangerous lah to to bahaya lah to go out
things in public kan and taking the public transport and dia ambil juga
so that's why memang tak nak dengar lah so susah sikit lah so like I was very worried for my parents but then it looks like
the numbers here in singapore is dwindling is is sudah semakin kurang
so nampaknya macam okay we're getting better
but then you tahu tak what is the difference between phase three dengan phase two sebab I tak tahu
yang tu jer
tapi I rasa macam activity tu not so important actually the ones that is more important to me is the travelling part lah
ah betul juga
but then like travel bubble kalau you boleh cadangkan travel bubble you rasa travel bubble dengan siapa
you get to pick five countries yang mana lima country yang you rasa you nak
you nak travel bubble dengan
tapi philippines dengan indonesia I would be very afraid
because philippines is uh dengan indonesia
ya because the two of them sekarang ni memang tengah competing and then philippines competing to be the winner
so rasa macam I don't I would not feel safe kalau we have travel bubble dengan mereka
ah new zealand new zealand is good ya memang cantik and I heard the prime minister is very good also mm
so ya I heard she has been doing her very well with the number of the COVID nineteen cases lah di di negara dia kan
so macam tu lah so biasanya you ada baca news kan Channel News Asia
yang macam mana yang ada apa like
apa rapist siapa
dalam Channel News Asia they reported that oh my god that is so sad kan
esok uh kerja lah apa lagi aiyo so everytime
uh kerja memang kerja from work from home lah tapi once I think about kerja I macam stressed sikit because I've been working twenty four seven
so I rasa macam I need a break lah
I tak boleh visit rumah orang tua lah sia COVID
macam mana I nak visit orang tua tak boleh lah
malas lah I rasa macam I kat duduk kat rumah I sleep cukup
ya betul
everytime tak boleh tidur because got problems trying to sleep lah insomnia kan
mm but then I don't want to take too much ubat also I want to make sure that I can fall asleep naturally
my house mate kan dia balik
then dia tidur kat sini
boyfriend dia tak ada so boyfriend dia tinggal kat tempat dia sendiri lah so
managed to buy me McDonald's breakfast dia ada buy one for one
ah murah
so macam tu lah eh you tahu tak rambut I kan lepas I dye dia merah dah kan
warna dia when my rambut is wet kan warna dia masih like
terlekat kat pillow I
you know my hair ni memang kan red
so I rasa macam
the hair dye that the hairdresser used tak berapa bagus ah because everytime I after when it's wet it's wet
two weeks already and it's will still stain baju kau there is no way that the thing is still like that betul tak
ya exactly this is lepas dua minggu dah and then dia masih stain baju dengan
but only bila dia basah
so it stained like my towel juga lah stain stain merah
mana boleh kalau kering pun it's uh ya but it's
[ah] betul there ah
so but then ah dia beli lah during um during apa ni
Harvey Norman singapore ada sales
jadi dia beli dari Harvey Norman lah
ya it was a a birthday surprise dia order dari Harvey Norman singapore
Harvey Norman singapore tu deliver kat I lah mm and I didn't know then when they ring the doorbell I was like
there was memang kelakar lah because the guy was like this one is for you I said I didn't order this he said oh your mum
so macam tu lah
oh we said we wanted to go to apa ni
and then kita masih belum pergi Holey Moley kan
I pernah dah ajak tapi you sibuk apa
kawan I lah yang seorang lagi
a'ah betul
ya tapi I ajak you you tak reply
sebab I tanya you nak pergi ke tak
pas tu you kau tak reply
tak tahu lah you busy every day lah ada banyak kawan kau
ah betul
uh kalau cycling I pengsan
susah lah I cannot lah if you ask me to go and do all these things
mm betul
ah tak boleh lah exercise
I tahu tapi I you you kan tahu I ni memang malas
nanti gemuk lah
it's okay lah kalau I gemuk
memang lah
oh and then you tahu tak
like sekarang ni kan I memang nak invest in stocks tapi I tak tahu macam mana
do you invest in stocks ke tak
orh I nak tapi I tak tahu macam mana nak start
oh boleh ke
tapi I nak ah
so you dah invest lama ke
oh dah lama ke
because I because I masih muda lagi kan
so I ni kena like willing to take the risk lah
mmhmm betul betul
okay tapi I nak start dengan
okay bagus
tapi because
if you want to invest in the share market you kena apa ni you kena start an account with with your bank right
is it with your banks or bukan macam tu
so macam macam lah
ya kalau gitu pun
ha betul lah
tak ada lah
tak ada lah tak ada investment
sebab itu lah susah sikit that's why I need to start thinking about my future kan
then like worried about like money and then sekarang job I ni pun tak ada commission
so I kena that's why I sekarang ni sibuk nak cari back a sales job so that I can get a bit of commission
project project macam ini kalau kita ada lebih then I don't have to worry so much
kalau project project macam ni memang lah I nak join
so rasanya tak tahu lah kalau mm
the share market investment I memang interested lah but then like
memang nak ah sebab tu that's why originally I was saving up my money untuk apa ni um
untuk sebab I nak belajar sepatutnya
tapi tu juga memang mahal kat
enam puluh ribu lebih susah lah
I rasa macam kalau boleh I nak study medicine juga tapi medicine kan I was thinking should I actually like
so but then career change susah sikit because like
macam mana I nak career change where do I start even kan so kalau I nak buat medicine medicine pun mahal
medicine is kira kira kalau kita study dekat australia
yang tu boleh but then but then you need to have the other additional like training lah
ah other additional training kalau you study dekat australia boleh sebab I ada seorang kawan dia memang
dia study kat monash university and then dia doctor lah kat sini
but then medicine tu mahal lah so
these kind of things you need money also if you want to switch your career and how you want to start all over and get certified so susah sikit lah
tengok lah that's why I pun tak tahu
no it's okay yang tu is out of the window I tak mahu
I nak kerja untuk diri sendiri I nak make sure that you know the money in the bank is mine and that
I tak dependent lah on anybody
parents okay lah kan parents kat singapore macam tu lah
tapi susah sikit lah because you know memang
so when you have two old parents here in singapore you kena
tak tahu lah
ada lah tapi pun susah nak keluarkan so kena tengok lah macam mana
ya betul
so tengok macam mana lah
biasanya bapa yang tak nak pi holiday mak yang nak mak nak pi holiday lah mak pernah pi holiday juga mak I bawa dia pi
I bawa dia pi aiyo banyak tempat lah sebab the job before this kan memang I had to travel and at that time
tak ada COVID lagi tak ada uh tak ada restrictions for travelling so
rasanya I brought her to a lot of places I brought her to
mm mana lagi I brought her to
at first originally kita nak pi vietnam this year sepatutnya I nak bawa dia pi vietnam especially end of the year when it's cold
either vietnam ke chiang mai because she likes cold places lah
and then I wanted to take her to cold places that is not expensive tak terlalu mahal kan
so vietnam atau chiang mai lah tapi sekarang mana mana pun tak boleh pi
so susah sikit lah duduk rumah tengok Netflix jer lah
tak tahu lah
aiyo dia ni
bapa I pun satu suruh dia pi suruh dia pi holiday
johor pun dia tak nak pergi
ah so memang susah lah sikit
ya lah mak I pernah pernah lah she wanted to go via this
travel agency pi holiday tapi susah sikit lah kalau you pi with travel agency I takut
mm tapi kalau they travel with travel agent kan
bukannya mahal ke because they will bring you to all these touristy areas
that like you know that akan charge you like really high prices
so susah sikit bukan
even makanan juga dia bawa you tempat yang mahal
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul lah
mm betul juga
lazarus island tu yang paling jauh I pergi ah duduk ferry tu pun I tertidur dalam ferry
oh betul ke you pernah pergi ke lazarus island oh
oh macam mana hari tu kau pergi
oh betul ke berpeluh
tapi hari tu bila I pi kan cuaca tu tak berapa baik
aku ambil umbrella tu abeh aku jalan from one from since the jetty
to the beach aku dalam umbrella tu sahaja
pas tu we were there only for one hour I dengan kawan I
kawan I ni lah kan dia yang ajak aku pi
then macam mana aku nak dia pun cakap ah tak apa tak apa
nanti tak akan hujan aku memang dah tanya dia aku tanya oh okay even though we have bought the ferry ticket
you nak tukar ke another day ah because
kan sekarang ni hujan lebat then we go there we cannot even picnic ke nak buat apa apa pun tak ada then umbrella pun kecil sangat
so then after that dia cakap tak apa tak apa hujan tak hujan akan err nanti dia akan
uh reda dah ah so kita continue with our trip anyway
so I cakap okay lah continue with our trip and then
enam orang lima orang sorry bukan enam
oh ya betul juga I terlupa lima orang ugh
nampak pula a'ah betul
ya kenapa pula I boleh terkira tambah seorang ah okay tak apa so ada lima orang kan
and payung tu memang kecil kecil ha
and then almost lah the wind blew away the payung and everything so end up we all just sat kat jetty tu waited for the ferry for two hours
ya tapi I memang suka bila dia cuaca tak berapa panas kan bila dia cuaca hujan I memang suka
kan I nak pergi tapi tengok lah kalau weekday I memang tak boleh sebab I kena ambil leave kalau weekend okay lah tapi weekend susah juga sebab I takut ramai orang lah
I ni memang kena clear leave tapi I tak nak ambil
I tak nak ambil leave on a on a weekday that is like a random day kan because I takut like
my boss will also kacau I
ah the the most strategic way of doing this is bila boss I
ah so dia tak akan kacau I
mm betul juga
mm so macam tu lah
huh you go all the way for a massage don't you think that's like really far away tak akan singapore tak ada massage kat sini
oh so biasanya you pandu kereta pergi situ bukan ambil uh apa ni ambil uh train lah
this neighbour of mine kan dia ni memang suka suka
buang sampah dia kat
luar the place where they are supposed to throw the rubbish bukan dalam chute tu tapi buang dekat luar
tak tahu lah and then uh
no or sometimes dia memang dah buka itu chute
so like tapi dia tak tutup properly so then or or they didn't push the rubbish properly into the chute all the way down
so bila I nak buang sampah when I bawa keluar I buka tu sampah tu masih ada kat situ
memang lah macam itu
ya so I wrote an email to management lah then I suruh management please remind everybody to
management cakap okay ah do you know who is in err who is the culprit
mana I boleh tahu hais ask me this kind of questions
macam tu lah
mm betul
minggu ni tak ada lah I nak tidur then I nak tengok Netflix
Netflix sekarang ni I nak tengok uh weekend ni I nak tengok enola holmes and then I nak tengok
I nak tengok
movie tu err kau rasa cinta
kau tak pernah dengar ke movie tu kau rasa cinta
ada lah movie ni popular
because I scared later I fall asleep lah when I tengok K drama
kau ada nampak video TikTok tu yang I bagi you tengok semalam tak
kelakar kan
ya I think I probably spend like six hours on TikTok I even like I ada pun uh send apa ni my job application to TikTok juga
I memang nak kerja dengan TikTok kalau TikTok nak hire I I memang nak
so technically kan I ni memang TikTok researcher dah
so kalau dia nak hire I I boleh cakap this is the amount of time I spend on your product I memang boleh join product you
tak nak lah
as if boleh jadi popular dengan TikTok bukannya senang sangat
tak ada lah
mana boleh senang lah cakap but then when you want to do it kan memang difficult a bit lah
memang uh okay I don't think my voice is merdu lah tapi tengok macam mana lah
malay song mm macam boleh juga tapi I rasa macam bila I cakap malay it's smoother lah kalau nyanyi malay not so
mm eh you tahu tak hari tu kan um
I pergi Holey Moley dengan norza kan I dah cakap tadi
this one seorang lelaki ni dia memang kerja kat situ as a waiter
then after that dia cakap kalau
uh if if he dia memang singaporean lah tapi dia ada relatives kat malaysia
budak melayu lah ni so then after that dia cakap oh um next time kalau you nak make booking kat Holey Moley for a table reservation ke apa you boleh call I lah
so dia ambil nombor I
then after that dia letak mm ah then then dia ambil nombor I then dia letak nombor dia dalam telefon I sebab telephone I memang ada kat
kat meja so then dia cakap eh you ambil lah nombor telephone I so next time kalau you nak reserve apa ke
you boleh call I so I cakap okay that's fine I'll do it
dia asyik text I
and I dah bagi tahu dia yang memang I dah ada boyfriend
and dia cakap oh
uh kalau dia dia cakap hari tu dia cakap apa ah
uh dia cakap oh
um bila you free
I nak bawa you keluar uh and then dia then dia cakap I nak bawa you keluar dengan Vespa I
Vespa dia then aku cakap um
kenapa I nak duduk Vespa kalau public transportation memang ada air con
then tapi ya so no lah but it's not just that it was like I dah memang dah bagi tahu yang I ada boyfriend
tapi dia masih muka tebal tau and then dia masih text I so I rasa macam
that's really weird so I I just straight up was like honest dengan dia and I bagi tahu lah that like
ah so I rasa macam dia tak ada boundary actually the thing was
I only save nombor dia sebab dia cakap
that kalau next time I nak reserve table I boleh call dia so I ingat like service dia bagus ke apa I wanted to write like a feedback on Facebook
kat Holey Moley yang dia ni memang baik ke apa
tapi turns out dia ni memang tak like like
asyik kacau I jer so I rasa macam a bit
mm macam tu lah
uh saya rasa I saya tak nak
I memang dah berterus terang I dah cakap I ada boyfriend
then after that dia ah then dia masih muka tebal lagi dia cakap oh
oh um I okay jer uh because dia cakap oh
um um so I would like to invite you for my birthday dinner then I'm I cakap
ah then aku rasa aku tanya dia only you and me
then dia cakap tak lah then they said uh then he said
dengan kawan kawan I
then dia cakap with a group of friends bukan you dengan I jer then the then he said
I tahu you you you tak you tak nak hang out one on one
tapi I okay jer
then I rasa macam the way he responded to it was very
it doesn't matter if you are okay with it ke tidak because you are
tapi kalau orang dah ada boyfriend atau girlfriend I don't think it's
ah so macam tu lah
then then aku tanya dia just you and I then dia cakap tak lah dengan kawan kawan I
tapi dia masih hari ni lagi ajak I pergi birthday dinner
pas tu I cakap
dia and then the way dia cakap kan
dia text I dia cakap oh
so I was but bukan I yang ajak dia keluar dia yang nak ajak I then I was like
mungkin you kena panggil uh then I said err maybe you just enjoy with your friends lah and have a good
pas tu dia cakap um
dia cakap err
bila I free
so it's like again you are coming back to that topic when I dah cakap
I memang dah tak bagi signal apa I tak uh it it's totally no signal it's disconnected
so I rasa macam it's just
ya but any way aku dah tak reply dia lah
ya betul juga
bukan lah dah pernah happen a number of times
no lah I mean uh no but anyway ya that was just off topic so coming back to this um apa ni COVID kan so um
in london COVID nineteen memang dah um
mm macam that time dalam kat australia
mm yang tu pernah happen dalam japan pun and then now they said that the
the virus dah mutate
betul juga but then only the young ones will have herd immunity the old ones would not be able to survive or the ones with underlying disease
so yang tu yang susah lah
mm tapi vaccine sekarang pun macam ada side effect
because I think sekarang ada tiga company yang tengah buat vaccine
no there is one that's Sanofi albert dengan AstraZeneca
Pfizer juga I think all of them are on board with that kot
sekarang ni albert memang memang apa ni uh memang aggressive to to do COVID because I nampak ada
for a number of um albert punya infectious disease department
ada lah tapi dia tak call I balik because I tak ada experience dalam infectious disease kot
mungkin boleh juga tengok macam mana lah
ada lah I think now they are busy with the campaign the presidential campaign it feels like I feel like this COVID thing has
yang U orang dengan dengan like
so that's why it turns out everybody pula yang terkena COVID
I rasa lah yang ni I rasa lah
ya betul
ya betul
betul lah
mm betul juga
but it's true I mean uh you know negara kita ni
memang lebih bagus lah
negara lain lain di southeast asia tapi negara kita ni memang
memang you know as much as what anybody else says negara kita ni memang terbaik
orang orang lain nak masuk negara kita untuk kerja kan orang malaysia ni
orang indonesia
orang china orang philippines kan ah
there err and memang ada semangat
nationality lah kat singapore
mm betul
ah ang moh tu apa ang moh
oh ang moh tu orang putih lah
oh okay okay ha betul lah
ya betul
jadi mungkin minggu ni kita nak pi botanical gardens ke tak
ya sebab I rasa
betul juga sebab I rasa macam botanical gardens ada satu cafe yang memang cantik
then dia ada like I pernah pergi dah lama dah um
and then dia ada yang rooftop tu memang glass rooftop and dia transparent and then boleh nampak everything
bukan Wildseed Wildseed ke kat botanical gardens bukan Wildseed tu terlalu
nampak dia terlalu nice and terlalu expensive yang tempat ni memang basic tapi makanan dia okay juga
mm tak tahu kalau ramai ke tak mungkin kita kalau kita pergi

jadi kau tidur lah awal sikit
okay then kalau gitu kan I dah cakap
kita pergi botanical gardens makan breakfast so macam mana kita nak makan breakfast kalau nanti lambat lambat
okay boleh juga
kalau ramai tengok lah kalau boleh reserve ke apa nanti kita Google lah

you tahu lah I ni memang singaporean
kalau jauh sangat I tak nak travel
kalau I tak ada kereta lah kalau ada kereta okay lah
ya betul lah
mm boleh juga
boleh boleh juga mm
jadi I rasa macam
ah okay lah dah lewat
and I pun sudah nak tidur you dah nak tidur ke tak
mm betul I juga
esok I kerja tapi lepas ni I akan kerja lagi sebab I kena habiskan benda mmhmm
selalu banyak lah tapi I'm I also like procrastinated a little bit
because I rasa macam malas nak kerja cause every day I've been working non-stop kan
hmm so rasa macam tired sikit lah but I need to finish this project
betul lah
ya betul because um tadi house mate I baru cakap uh kawan dia
uh kawan dia punya husband ke apa atau mungkin kawan dia lah dia ni memang pilot
um dengan apa ni ke apa lah and then after that lost the job and now buat kat macam customer service or something lah
pay but have to still pay for the mortgage and such so ya susah sikit lah
oh so wife dia tak ada job lah
oh tapi dia ada apply ke tak untuk job
ah betul
so dia ada like that has she reached the level whereby like
dia memang dah interview and they've asked her to do a presentation
ada lah but didn't get the job oh wah susah kalau gitu kan lepas everytime kena buat presentation one after the other and then tak dapat job tu
dia kerja dalam what err what sector
oh dalam pun kena retrenchment
wah teruk lepas tu
tapi dia ada err package tak
ada lah then okay lah kalau ada package maybe because dia enam belas tahun dah
oh then okay lah yang tu
orh betul juga
mm betul then dia tak ada commitment
mm betul
ya and freeze hiring kan ya betul juga
bonus pun tak ya bonus pun tak ada
dengar dengar lah dari kawan I memang bonus pun tak ada
ya bukannya the COVID thing has been solved aiyo if we go through another year like that teruk lah macam mana
harap-harap lah kita dapat lebih project macam ini
kalau kita dapat bagus lah kan
mm betul juga
um I nak cakap terima kasih ya joann err sebab hari ni datang rumah I belanja I makan
terima kasih ya so kita tengok lah kalau err minggu ni
weekend nanti kita akan maybe jumpa lagi kat botanical gardens makan breakfast ya
bagus lah
so ini hari we will be talking about corona virus
err in Singapore and how so far kita kat sini at home and uh my family semua how we've been coping
err with all the jobs and all the um confinement semua kat rumah
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how I've been interacting dengan all my friends lah basically
bila we heard about all this um
corona virus thing err dulu back then I was somewhat employed lah
terus um when I heard about it at first err it didn't seem like such a big deal lah because um
people over there were quite err rilek they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
err maybe it won't be as such a big issue lah tapi after that when I came back um
I was given a couple of mask tapi I thought like okay lah not really necessary but err eventually it turns out that
so that time bila we saw it on the news err my my girlfriend's uh auntie lah so dia kasi
uh because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only macam ten masks or so something like this
habis um ask us to use it err when we are at the airport sebab err who knows kan especially Indonesia agaknya maybe
not so safe lah and then err so I flew back I still wear the mask uh at first I thought macam too much ah actually macam maybe
kat station pakai mask habis um some of them err they there was no form of social distancing ah back then so there was no such advice but
mask ada quite a number of people they were wearing it lah and then um they decided to
eventually err make an announcement on and said that dia punya mask ini semua actually not mandatory lah at first then cakap only kalau macam you sick err you stay at home
err just jaga yourself lah there's no need to go out um and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
um slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe err eventually um it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic lah habis Malaysia orang Malaysia affected orang Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to macam got on the list lah
ah so at first we were the first habis
err in Euro and then slowly got to America and now sekarang kan kita in a state where um
employed habis sekarang macam like looking for job because uh
how about your experience macam mana you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think siapa siapa anyone lah was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted banyak um even home based business at some point was err affected kan
uh that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less macam slammed her
ya but err because of what she said a lot of people macam tak satisfied lah diorang macam
um kena pulau rabak rabak lah basically because of her statement she even
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or niat dia the niat is there lah tapi macam
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good macam nak tolong all these regulation issue ah
tapi sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay lah I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is um what she should have done was
after she did it and of course nak return balik dia punya statement susah kan but at least macam just go out there and just apologize properly
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
and err some of them are funny macam the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend Hadi because okay to be fair sebab
habis he will macam ah be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants cuma bike is slightly different lah
like the first time I saw it macam this could be Hadi
it could really have been Hadi the way they dress dia punya seluar dengan dia punya helmet dia punya visor
uh unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but uh I think a lot of people macam does really
um macam it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite uh positive feedback ah about the guy dia super extra ah
and um while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large tapi macam it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say macam this guy this mat just naik motor habis just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that dia macam very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
err the first tak salah Deliveroo was to start all this tapi in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something lah
but what I really feel about food delivery is dia macam quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second ah about Grab drivers err not Grab drivers
people who are do food delivery all this kalau they really macam really work hard macam chiong all the way ah macam maybe eight hours chiong all the way macam Hadi for example kan
um they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on macam mana they hit dia punya incentive or macam mana they hit dia punya
um hours or dia punya right timing ah because all these riders kan macam dorang dah experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right kedai mana um
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game lah basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery ah
to the upper income group because macam especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery macam ya macam every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars uh or something ah per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people macam err  beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
no much prerequisite lah maybe if you macam nak deliver naik motor kan then
ah kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen lah but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview err macam documentary lah don't know on Grab and how err some of the handicap people
um they managed to get jobs in Grab macam dulu um when they before Grab kan macam there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say macam if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes tapi ada orang macam down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know macam is like a big macam beban
duduk kat rumah jadi beban jer puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this uh girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair lah
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver lah maybe satu hari deliver four or five items lah for example
so macam berdikari lah so instead of
the interface macam the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
err it it simplifies the task basically pergi sendiri pick up pergi sana drop off so it it it gives this
admin position or something macam kena interview tak tahu pass ke tak err your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless macam kalau too saturated or something lah there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
um the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how uh blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers punya salary
err I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate macam
you you don't get err you don't get denied err okay selalunya the idea is when you do the employment kan err you cannot be judged based on your I don't know err race or
so macam for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so err nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah so when you're tired you get home
so that so called keep them motivated lah whereas macam delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
and you don't have that burden of oh hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
ah yes okay definitely lah so basically macam you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars err what you get
is um basically is through the app punya interface ah so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours lah
it's it's already a net amount dorang already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off err because sometimes
for example um whatever the food is dorang dah minus the food amount so err this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
terus err whatever is shown in your phone macam you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example ah that's yours lah basically
you are okay let's say you are riding habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan
oh tak ee I still got to go on I need to hit um ten deliveries today or uh I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
and how it is a good way for people macam let's say they have spare time ah macam let's say they work nine to five
habis malam macam they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then err just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
err ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus tapi sekarang dah starting so much on delivery
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to buku letak kat tepi
what sort of err security feature or identification yang dorang implement
kan risau
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already macam kirim salam ah
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle lah but you think that you are macam everything dah okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project kerja just to survive on the salary from that job
um but I kudos to you lah memang is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
or Facebook ada politics pe sekolah pun ada politics pe but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
in school walaupun you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that macam there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying macam nak enjoy susah
tapi okay it it depends on people right so um
two major popular universities that they went to is either or eh so macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
whereas for the one that I went to basically err buat project
err it it it becomes like what uh eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent kat belakang exam
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent tapi kalau you have macam ada solid group you can work with
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours ada project kan
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to macam all these budak budak they still have not have a taste of full life macam full working employment yet
that's why I think a lot of my friends yang um went to you uni SIM basically err university
night university lah so dia orang juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life ah there's no more social life basically
err pagi pagi daytime you go to work and then err malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time nak buat err nak buat group assignment nak study untuk exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
ya there's a lot of compromise err and you have to be willing to macam at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social lah because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
no lah at first to be honest ah at first bila all this thing happen kan macam um it's interesting err because is something novel
macam is not common apa dulu to to um communicate through okay maybe for you lah but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family tapi when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
err at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime uh kerja err in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward macam I think it depends on people also lah because ada orang ada orang boleh focus when they're at home
or the bed sleep lah take a nap during lunch time tu semua for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas kalau macam kat tempat kerja you've got to drag your ass and then
they switch into mode you know macam home mode err duduk kat rumah macam
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing punya mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is macam all wax style and then
ah you know you're wearing clothes um and then you go out and eh you you just have that vibe macam I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know macam when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in um I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in dia punya scheduling and stuff like that tapi
macam dekat rumah you can just eat macam you can snack and all that shit err but kalau kat luar uh macam you need to walk for it and uh I don't know
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you err do delivery uh I think the so called delivery fee is about macam four dollars something like this kan
and you can actually see they have macam those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package tak salah is err
no it's like a pass lah it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's apa macam limited edition kan tapi it's actually has been around for awhile
oh well people still deliver food a lot of people still macam still work from home pe banyak orang work from home pe sekarang lah
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while sampai sekarang
fishy ah the Russian punya vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three what
entah eh
entah lah
well kalau at the end of this year dapat pergi dapat pergi Malaysia pun I'm quite happy already to be honest
all the other countries at least dapat pergi somewhere within their own country kan so Malaysia even Malaysia or Indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least boleh pergi Penang dapat pergi um I don't know
for one of the islands Perhentian islands or something you know Sentosa nak pergi Sentosa Sentosa ada apa kau dah kenapa
if itu bukan itu bukan dia ini tau is not like dia pergi by himself dia pergi ikut err the diving punya tour thing
you still can go pulau hantu now actually
now that I got all this part time job at least macam my sleeping schedule is a bit better
tidak before that I was sleeping macam pukul lima pukul
empat it was ugh didn't like it is too late I forever young what you talking about man I'm you're only as old
tapi it's not like exclusive for
thirty more seconds kita kena clap eh lepas ini or
habis just stop jer
okay tak apa tak apa tak apa uh it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now
okay boleh dengar
kalau tidak nanti it becomes distorted
okay okay then aku adjust
the boundary ah okay aku baru pasang
okay lah aku tak buat salah ah macam I I don't see
I wouldn't penalize myself uh just now ah maybe yesterday okay lah because yesterday aku macam kaku sikit because I didn't ride for very long right
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to lah but aku dah datang lambat semalam
semalam aku tak lambat so
then he started the face like macam
tahu macam oren penyet punya kan looking not happy like that so I was like okay lah I tell him I said okay I got experience like that uh uh kau experience kat mana aku cakap dulu I oh okay somebody go ask sampai back berapa then like uh
empat ke lima ah after second assessment
oh okay okay this one not for you go that one dia cakap macam tu
and obviously I I kept stalling like I um not midway but I kept stalling at that place yang you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so dia macam when I'm moving then dia stall stall stall gitu
I don't see anything wrong with it lah macam they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that aku bawa maybe thirty five ah thirty or thirty five ah it break dia punya speed ah
so the the problem was uh okay that that was yesterday so aku faham
I made less than less than ten rounds ah it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was um dia cakap okay uh he put two people out
tak nak lah
fact ni cakap I didn't even stall today macam because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice kepala otak dia lah need more practice at least you come and tell me macam maybe I did something wrong maybe aku terlalu laju or aku macam maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know ini macam guessing game you know or not like oh I asked him I asked me just now I said oh actually what what went wrong like
wah tadi kau okay uh everything okay breaking okay tak macam semalam cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
oh takde apa-apa kau just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking kepala otak kau kau pun every prac kau pegang motor ke sama juga kan it's the same it's the same model what it's the same bike what what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated lah at that point of time then I just ah ya you know sudah lah
but tapi dia punya failure aku faham because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really tergolek you know rabak ah
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about ah okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not yang belakang yang that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan admin punya side
time belok
dia turning ah ada cornering ah so
I was in front of her so aku bawa okay everything semua okay so I already made one round already
and then the instructor pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror lah but I won't speeding I won't because that part memang you have to go down to get to that turn what
then aku belok sekali ada eh
because the other places where you turn ada orang it's quite open but that particular corner is is is ha memang seclude you cannot see anything there ah
ha then the instructor was like uh apa kau buat lagi alamak dia cakap macam tu kan then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop ah stop and wait
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left memang tak boleh lah of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you ah I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that ah so I guess takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say eh sorry eh kalau in your way I say nevermind it's okay lah you just
just do your thing ah then the instructor go and tell her some more you know ha masa dah buang ni lagi
she likes to macam himpit to the left side
so no she probably got so close and after that she gabra because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
ha badan dia pula was on the other lane
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia
and then after that uh she was trying to start the bike ah kelakar cause when she fell kan I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then apa she said eh uh I think my motorbike spoiled dia cakap macam tu and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled dia ingat spoiled dia try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik one you cannot hear the engine starting ah
alamak how ni eh gini gini gini then he go there he said this one your switch your switch ha check your switch okay
then dia begin
takpe uh number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake takpe takpe takpe I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one ah so after that sampai habis
so I was just riding and riding and riding macam no problem lah to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one yang pakai bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying ah tall guy malay
muka dia macam mat sial sikit dia dia was on the he was on the he was at the bend yang depan lagi before you turn back into the the the admin area dia jatuh part sini kira square
macam ni kan admin area kat sini kan dia ada tempat sini si instructor lagi satu dia lepak sini the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed kau nak brake buat apa you're already breaking already what I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
macam you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice ah turn and like salah salah kau kena brake lagi kau kena brake lagi brake brake sebelum kau down gear brake kau nak brake apa lah siol so
at that point of time the more he talk the more aku peng ah but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three tudung girls in his class
tapi dia orang baru nak keluar ah so
aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa ah just want to start one again ya I guess normal leh you know whatever lah eh
for me lah as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong dia suruh aku main one two one two one two three aku one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
ha plank plank quite senang what
but I still remember two B in seven seconds tak salah aku is fast lah let me class to you have to go thanks again eh
ya I saw I saw it uh tak salah aku nampak dekat mana eh
you don't upgrade now lah dol you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten ke something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once kau dah
confident once kau rasa macam you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike ha that is five six years later you you change ah you don't have to macam oh I get class two sekarang juga aku nak tukar ha
but ya um then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the lampu
four bottles mampus mampus
ya lah because you got to change it frequently apa
have what ah three ten is is pendek what
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten cantik sia
the yang one ninety
the the the the apa the capacity capacity I think is
dia punya tank eh dia punya tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
ya but the thing is a zontes kalau let's say misal kata if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike mampus ke apa ke kat sana bro I'm dead sia
that's why you never go jauh-jauh I mean you went to malacca once right
ya lah you common bike boleh ah you you use all this kind of funny sounding bike even continental yang tak kira asia tak popular punya mampus kalau motor kau mati
oh kira macam gitu siala
habis ah
malaysia boleh
but imagine if you're like stuck in I don't know negeri sembilan ke apa
kena jaga ah
aiyo kena bully ah
but if you tolak means kena bawa perlahan ah very slow ah
sticky situation macam mana
no but kau boleh brake juga apa
dulu punya trend eagle apa ha
wobbly ah lepas tu jatuh ah
kira dia orang semua members ah
time tu your father belum kahwin ah
masih bujang lapuk ah
tapi it's just dangerous sia
oh ya ya ya I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard belum lagi after
speaking of of of of this part tadi um
there was this guy I don't know I got tell you or not tadi ada satu he was on the mini circuit ah
a'ah sia basically the bike is is basically the the the wall like this but he went up and then he was still he was still turning bro on the bike whack everything first kena the plastic barrier after that ah already dah ada bunyi like gitu broom gitu then after that
then he continue moving bro so the wall was here and then his bike was there the wall his his bike was rabak sial
aku tak tahu but after that he stop kaki dia sakit
here he cannot climb between after when he when he so called fell the bike was lying on him he bike was lying on him and he was sandwiched between the bike and the wall then dia macam I cannot ah I cannot
aku macam alamak
then the instructor the instructor just like eh nevermind you all continue continue macam tak apa-apa gitu nevermind nevermind you all continue and then he go he he came out lah to pull the bike one side then ask him you okay or not but I think after that he didn't didn't continue
I do not know but I I know dia cakap pasal after that's he walk he was limping
sakit juga siol sakit juga

um it's more slice of life I guess um so I guess I prefer that kind rather than macam like actually the things I remember watching
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so macam for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers kalau dia tak pakai kan nanti dia bangun pagi kan terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
it's so merepek but it's so good it's so kelakar gila like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch ah saiki it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I rasa belum habis
like I've started two three weeks ago I rasa belum habis
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time tak habis-habis tau I'm like bila ni
aku tak tahu ada berapa season berapa banyak episode I'm still with season two tau season freaking two
oh yang total aku tak tahu aku belum I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that lah cause I guess I can relate to it more macam shonen is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
even this one tak masuk akal pun at least I I can relate
I I actually um because I brought home najhah's punya um haikyu jacket and
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite berisi juga like she's not stick thin
plus it's like her favourite show so I tak nak hampakan lah
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like oh my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask kak zan and kak najhah you jangan macam gini eh
some how are some people are just really ridiculous tau merepek gila tau dia punya perangai and then after awhile I realized that for
ha tu lah
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like eh sixteen where you want to find online macam mana cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
jesse mccartney no lah that's a singer merepek jer sampai jer kutuk aku bukan
tu lah uh tak boleh haram
ah biasa okay lah bagus lah apa apa lah shah
ah tu lah oh my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like tunduk to the husband
you should just have said tiga so
kau datang dari drama mana ni
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched nur
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this um new ustaz baru graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
who has his own um tahfiz school and his own masjid
and then one day while he was giving the ceramah subuh thank god he he
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people um and it's really weird because
ha dia orang Q&A tak pernah dengar kan
ada Q&A session uh the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version masjid version
bila keluar masjid then dia nampak this kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis on a white piece of paper
he was macam ya like wow
so but like more in depth lah so like for him like want to provoking macam hati dia macam dup dup
uh kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni
everywhere like dia punya dekat jalan and they met and they dated
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she tergesa-gesa but the she just
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's tak masuk akal the level of patients and the
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was cinta si wedding planner
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then kat rumah and she's about to sleep and she's wearing tudung
or she's sleeping in her tudung
or like maybe not the not the you know the nenek-nenek kind
ha tu lah
coffee apa starbucks
cause kita dekat dengan bugis kan kita boleh pergi haji lane like haji lane okay for example yang macam kalau kau nak makan makanan melayu semua
macam zamzam ada ataupun err ah ramen stall dim sum place also that time I went ramen stall quite nice ah
sedap sia nak try ya it's apa tu okay lah
I feel like kita reserve reservation punya tempat jer ah through online aku buat
orh then kau last minute rush ah
yang tadi kau punya kawan semua ah okay
uh huh eh how come orh it's the presentation eh tadi but how come your works kena collected
mm ya correct correct correct ya you make the final uh apa tu big change ah
because like kau fikir banyak sangat then after that like at the end of the day you know macam this thing happen like you tak expect what
you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know pada kau because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like oh dia macam it's their first time seeing it ah so they will either like it or not like it ah so if it if they like it means it's good lah
apa tu what they say about your works semua like during the presentation
no fine arts ah aku lain kan mm uh huh
mm orh maybe macam I feel like the concept doesn't really
entah eh
kau punya asal like okay kau lecturer berapa banyak dalam presentation room
fever and dengue dia rabak eh chronic eh but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct oh okay so only one presentation ah bagus sia
aku dua presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself macam tiga lecturer yang kita ada
and then like uh week sixteen is another lecture that we tak kenal ya so it's like uh brand new face that see macam because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer kita kan everyday nampak kan so like they bring this another lecturer then from there terus but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like err that one I can say uh make or break ah
ya but the adjunct lecturers semua baik gila ya
pe processor ya entah lah that what name ya
cause last sem really it's rabak eh and I feel ya entah maybe because pasal like
entah eh I feel like last year was their year macam shu dengan like eden I feel like this year it's like me and effy punya ya their they are so rabak oi ah ya last term last term
mm honestly aku
mmhmm orh it's your own major right ya ya kita every sem tukar kelas ya but fuck
because like honestly I thought this sem kita akan tukar kelas lagi but then me and effy macam alamak kita geram gila ah
you know we still in the same class tapi macam okay how it goes right that
sama class so everyone in sama class ah so basically its like monday tuesday is kita punya satu module jer kita ada for this sem for next coming sem ah satu module jer but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
kirakan major ah like what we want
macam we have macam performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot ah performing arts then we have
apa tu packaging motion design semua then we can only choose three aku ambil
okay what macam aku ambil figure drawing is the same what but it's still under fine arts what
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of apa tu routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then uh from that three then kita belajar then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem aku tak dapat ambil dua yang figure drawing full kan
ya so aku just have to cause my I only have to take two for my module ya huh oh my god aku four jer eh mmhmm
oh ya ya but packaging ah the aku dengan effy took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what oh design and brand strategy because honestly uh kalau kita ada tiga ni benda kan then intern kita will be easier though ya because like for us macam apa eh
ya and honestly aku tak sabar untuk intern I don't know why
cause like I feel like kita boleh pilih but at the same time macam our lecturer will be the one that ya but uh honestly after that after this coming semester kan kita ada three months holiday right then me and effy thought of like kerja at any uh graphic comm punya firm and then from there kalau like we feel that in in apa tu that company is quite good then we just continue until intern lah
dah ada kerja what you mean okay uh huh
kerja for that really meh no lah I don't think so tu ni diploma
the process then kau will first day macam for example first day kau is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya lah so apa yang kau nak start dalam year two sem two ya lah the process is year two sem two lah ya lah okay so that's what I should've say girl
hmm entah eh I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can macam
then after that like uh tak the cons is like you have to compete with everybody ah
and a bit like macam
in your face tau macam company tu tak nak kau macam ouch sakit sia honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they dekat apa tu indeed aku nampak banyak macam art teacher abeh those apa eh
that C word I forget what is that for the ni lah budak-budak art
bukan taxi lah aduh
I mean like your course quite broad lah honestly and yesterday also aku cari macam kedai-kedai eh kedai eh company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to kerja as part time eh stop it
ya so stop hais eh kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang picking packer okay lah this whole week kau take a break then maybe kita start kerja next week ah
kalau bukan this week kau nak confirm dengan aku bila okay okay okay
hais no cause aku start kerja kan
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail punya position I can find other retail stores to work you know it's a stall but macam kirakan there's a lot of macam promoter at each section so you are doing that kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga overall then kau kena tengok-tengok and at the same time you have to like go for the customer ni semua lah
point you know oh my god I just censored my own ya and then like I never even get that position so aku it's a retail position or cashiering I don't know I mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store kau kena take care of ya so exactly that's why aku terus like
aku dah tak aku dah quit I told shah about it and then I was super depressed you know what I did they don't even know what I'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like oh you can just go to the customer then I'm like oh okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
I think six hours nine eleven to six eh I just whatsapp the manager ah say like the environment is not for me uh what uh this is honestly not what I expected it lah macam this is not the position I he haven't reply but I left the group already ya kalau tak esok aku kerja esok thursday aku actually dah full this this week
tu aku nak tanya kau nak kerja picking packer ke tak no no no the packer
because just now tak ini packer packer kat dia bilang kau pack apa
toy R us actually okay eh quite good eh aku nak ni green party apa kedai dia okay dok kau tahu kan the kedai jual apa no the green party
you don't know that store dia macam miniso eh
it's okay though that kedai
what if kau kena tengok shift dia juga shift dia dengan
shift dia dengan dia punya working hours
jauh oi okay true
I don't know kalau kau nak aku boleh
kalau kau nak aku okay I don't know ah I feel like
but semalam aku ada bilang kau kan yang apa tu
yang aku screenshot lah kerja tu
mana eh
ada safe distancing ambassador eh kat sentosa eight dollar per hour jer kot
kau just uh they they what they say is that
bodoh lah kau
kau kan
entah lah everything's okay though I can say belum ah baru submission oi
tak kita tak ada kita dah tak ada ah
okay I understand I don't know ah I feel like those abeh macam general studies and all right I I don't understand macam nanti like apa kita buat then like what we dapat is like the hell
mm entah eh
eh legit ah makan ramen stall aku nak try ni ah ball
tu apa bukan tu boat noodle ramen stall is the japanese punya ni sebelah dim sum punya ni kat haji lane
macam aku nak tunjuk aku tengah record
a'ah eh betul juga eh
but then I don't want to spend so much today eh aku dah tak ada duit I spent but tipo honestly is berapa eh berapa dollar ah
allowance for this month and then kalau aku tak kerja aku tak ada duit kalau dah habis
oh my god don't say aku punya printing jer one time printing fifty five dollar eh I have to print my uh board I have to print my
apa tu photo book
ya because our now is like macam
apa tu macam buku ah kirakan
I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my and ya they uh then end up orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah exactly so I'm like exactly then uh effy is quite mad ya
effy dia sot lah tak aku example it's like really unfair ah I don't know why but it's just the school lah I can say
you show macam orang punya kerja it's like a good thing lah but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
apa tu copy yours and do better and after that
and you are still kat bawah trying to survive padahal kau punya it's like orang yang copy
eh kau suka pergi hiking tak
tak aku macam nak pergi hiking
aku dah lama mana tak pergi hiking abeh one time aku kat abeh macam mana
entah lah
not every ah ya can say ya macam friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo ah so every time dia nak patah balik patah balik sunday ya
aku tak bilang siapa-siapa ya it's like I don't know ah at times we gaduh and then like but that one time we gaduh right quite rabak ya but uh the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it macam you know if we break it off then what's the point of us macam wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct mm the thing I like about him right dia punya mindset is really mature oi he's your age ya
then like I don't know ah dia macam dia cakap like kalau you dah tak suka I semua ke apa in our relationship anytime tau kalau aku just dah tak ada feelings but just bilang dia and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go lah kalau tak macam if he wants to make it work lah ya so it's like very matured thing ah at the same time kalau kita nak break it off
we have to really macam talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
ya really a lot until we I think he um apa eh I call kan dia tak angkat
at that point macam betul-betul like he like we had enough of each other lah
but then macam um during the period the first few weeks terus macam makin lama makin okay then now it's better ah
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right dengan my school schedule then like we met almost everyday sia then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
and like pejam celik pejam celik aku next month dah one year dengan dia dok
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then I told you that I like this guy ya tu masih suka eh aku masih uh kerja kat seh baru baru oh my gosh then now dah nak one year it's quite fast eh really really fast

seri pun wah that time I talk to seri kat cause I say I miss her then after that wah I quite proud eh have you seen her instagram

you know like it's pointless if we keep advising but they don't really ya honestly aku tak kisah kalau dia tak nak ikut ke tak because it's usually up to the person lah but at least consider of what I say lah or like try to say it in a way whereby kau kau akan kena you know or like just reflect prepare you ya ya so it's like you are not you are not actually hearing what I said ya
what again I thought they have been bestie again daripada dulu sampai sekarang

ya lah it's just the makeover you know entah lah
kau jangan merepek lah kau aku pun tak tahu kadang-kadang keluar kadang-kadang turun balik I'm not in a constant mood aku dah malas already

cause aku tak pakai makeup uh aku pakai makeup aku pakai makeup that time kan dia cakap
uh you tak mahu pakai makeup ah asal
uh tak ah tak ada apa-apa then like apa dia ni berbual then aku aku that time insecure gila ah cause aku tak pakai makeup aku dah penat gila then dia cakap
tak payah makeup makeup dah lawa then aku macam okay ah ya but actually I don't know cause aku dah biasa pakai makeup so it's like a routine lah so once you tak pakai makeup it's like shit ya so ya that's me ah but honestly
entah eh because seeing back me and year one right I actually
aku year two kan legit oi macam no effort
time aku pakai makeup pun pergi luar jer mm ya aku pun dah malas
then like entah eh
apa tu dressing up and all when you're school is how many hours jer
entah ah exactly that's that's the thing
ya ya because I feel like it's very macam entah eh you feel like shit mm makeup everything ya I agree I agree because like you don't you don't want to be the
macam the sad looking person amongst all the pretty girls ah penat ah kadang-kadang
aku dengan kawan aku yang perempuan perempuan pun semua pakai makeup lawa-lawa then aku macam alamak then nanti you stress on your own oh shit what am I supposed to wear oh my god what am I supposed to actually same
but usually at some point aku dah malas gila aku pakai aku punya baseball jersey dengan aku punya jeans dah abeh orang pakai kasut kan semua lawa-lawa aku pakai slipper oi
legit eh dah malas ah mm
then eh busy punya
ya sometimes no heck care lah ya that time pun birthday party kawan aku wah I find it wah really pointless it was last week uh after I send shah then uh dress code K me being a person where I wear black and white everyday cause I'm a very monochrome person right
my friend err the dress code is warm tones alamak ya lah but then all the tu apa yang skirt tu aku dah tak boleh muat oi tu year one aku kecil sia aku sekarang dah gemuk oi legit I walk away a lot when I was with shah cause we eat a lot ya then after that aku macam alamak
I wore white t-shirt eh white uh long sleeve dengan yang skirt tu apa tu yang shawl hitam ya so it was okay
then terus aku macam alamak nak pakai apa eh tengok aku punya closet tinggal satu baju white apa warm tones kan warna brown tapi it's not really brown it's brownish yellow abeh semua stripes stripes ada warna putih then aku macam alamak pakai jer lah and then I
err for me it's like err macam very
masai ah
not aunty lah but masai ah macam entah ah selekeh ah then after that aku jumpa kawan-kawan aku semua tak ikut dress code lepas tu dia orang cakap dia orang tak ada then aku macam abeh semua pakai baju top warna putih abeh seluar hitam then aku macam bro I could've just wore that seh abeh kawan aku yang perempuan lagi pakai hitam
aku dah macam girl at the birthday party right is only the family yang pakai warm tones then aku just macam I'm like what so ya orh it's actually merepek ah oh tu pun aku dah tak boleh muat eh skirt tu ya I want to I don't know where that skirt go already or ya kita pergi museum pe cause that time ada yang mm neon light that one kind ya sekarang dah boring ah neon light
you know I don't uh she told me that she don't like but I feel that she like him dah lama cause girl
ya and then dia cakap aku ada bilang kau kan yang dia orang pergi club together and all oh my god
then aku cakap kau kalau seri bilang kau kau act macam tak tahu jer eh aku cakap gitu
ya honestly my class sekarang is not really actually bonded every class aku pergi is not bonded
it's all clique by clique by clique which I find it macam a bit irritating ah
ya so aku sekarang stick dengan effy jer walaupun the other girls kan dia orang satu clique err like ada chinese girls dengan chinese girls and then kita ada lagi satu girls macam macam indonesian dengan singaporean macam campur but dia orang semua baik ah aku punya orang is
even though I have three err I'm always like with that one friend I will always be neutral to everybody ya so macam mana-mana aku pergi nanti dia orang macam eh nelly nelly so aku macam okay ah then like um that that one group of girls semua okay lah dia orang okay dengan aku so aku okay ah
melayu indonesia cina ya campur-campur ah
cause kadang-kadang aku tak ada benda nak buat buat pun aku pergi kat dia orang macam hey how's your work
ya group work pun kadang-kadang aku just campur dia orang
err nadhirah eh uh huh khine ya dia suka
tahu pasal huh how they know
no girl it's very hard for him to like somebody and the way the girls that he like is all mostly chinese or korean or japanese dia punya pasal lah eh macam girls like angel yes ya you know malays is super hard ah kalau nak kawan dengan dia kawan rapat macam kita boleh I feel like a lot of girls jealous bila kita rapat dengan him because kita jumpa khine kita selalu macam peluk abeh rapat-rapat pe but he's like for me it's like I don't know eh
ya and I put the line already eh you know and I find him more like girl friend instead of a boy friend macam hey khine mm okay
nanti kadang-kadang macam hey girl then aku macam aku terus khine then after that ah that time aku masih in my in my clique ah aku nampak dia kat err apa campus one lobby abeh lepas tu dia macam hey girl then wear tudung tau
then semua orang tengok aku tau then terus kita lari kita peluk each other dia macam macam you know those like love movies like something then we just we just have each other ah then everyone look at us you know macam semua tak expect ah like um macam dia kan handsome nak mampus so everyone confirm macam err confirm everyone macam oh I want to be the one that is hugging I don't know lah kadang-kadang I find it macam a bit merepek ah
hmm entah aku tak tahu nak berbual dengan siapa aku macam okay let's just berbual dengan budak-budak pakai tudung mana tahu dia orang baik ah aku macam gitu but then once I heard kau hello I'm anna I'm twenty one from girl be my friend
because everyone is very young eh at that point then I'm like huh ya that's why it's like entah ah but the the reason why I was close with shaz first because I was the only one that talk to her during that general ya class
cause that time aku cakap dengan shafiq err aku just nak cari classmate aku ah macam kawan daripada class aku kan at least ah aku boleh pergi kelas dengan dia aku tak seorang ya so that's my ya because she sit in front of me tak aku just try out jer then aku just hi uh like what class you from oh I from uh one that time kita punya class apa one G eh honestly tak ingat apa dia cakap one G

that statement melayu tak setia is it by your friend punya experiences or what
then your friends punya experience
perempuan perempuan lelaki your friend
mana tahu you ada kawan perempuan lepas tu dia break hari-hari pula every month
so your friend is the one yang yang wah player sia playboy
serious ah habis tu dia dia every month dia confirm akan tukar
tukar wow
aku ada aku sentiasa ada untuk kau oh plot twist oi
apa A&W
okay what if like what what what if like someone confess to you that that she got a crush on you ada
makan kat mana mcdonald
boleh lah tapi macam you guys are still schooling itu semua macam it's a bit too ex for you guys
mm safian dah graduate then now you are in
so got like at least macam basic pay lah I don't know how much then
err habis tu perempuan ni okay this girl like like interested in you tapi dia pun nak pergi high class how will you react
okay what if like macam perempuan ni macam okay lah she she nice tu semua macam dia dia cantik cute apa tu semua okay you like her tu semua
dia punya attitude just
how would you react ataupun dia macam dia dia dia kaki kikis dia macam mesti macam everytime
everytime dia dia cakap macam nak keluar kan mesti kena pergi high class punya tu serious ah
tak what what what if like tak dia punya personality semua bagus okay dia punya attitude but ah baik bukan sucks attitude dia bagus tu semua and all that then dia macam
is like a dream girl macam you know she got everything itu semua
tapi kan
macam she just want to go out with you macam high class restaurant tu semua lepas tu bila kau orang keluar kan tak boleh kena hujan tak boleh kena panas
tak boleh public transport kena grab
tak tak tak tak I want to check the timing so you will like to like to list down pula oh lagi sepuluh minit so you will like rather go out with someone who is like average looking apa tu semua
kalau control macam macam
oh macam dia cheat lah that kind of thing
okay but then again if if someone ada niat untuk cheat right
anything any possible mean and way they can do it ya so macam it doesn't mean on the look macam sometimes dia macam boleh macam
even sometimes macam okay lah I got I got hear and and see before with my own eyes macam muka dia macam biasa jer tau still can cheat
I don't know I don't know how lah but then like is is just possible anything is possible also ya so I guess at the end of the day it's just niat dengan hati
jap eh
mm ha apa apa apa okay okay okay sorry I cannot multitask lah okay apa ada perasaan
ah ah macam confess ah
okay for girls right sometimes we like to jual mahal like me legit legit so
tak lah I mean like macam ya it's just a phrase like macam
okay then then in order to know if like she is really not interested in you ataupun like like nak jual mahal right you just continue talking to her if she still like continue talking to you right
macam like a few months later then like tengok ah your your chemistry with this person lepas tu try to macam go out with dia tu semua
tapi jangan jangan cakap lagi yang you interested in her so macam if you guys macam rasa macam there's a chemistry between you guys there's like something going on with you guys right
ya lah I mean like I mean okay because you already told her that you are interested in her then she said she's not interested in you what betul tak so so you already accepted accepted that then that's macam for you for you now you think that she treat you as a friend jer so in order to proceed to the next level tanya dia what do you what she see
macam itu because some girls are like just just not interested lah gitu
tapi kalau dia macam fickle minded macam one moment the she she treat you as a err more than friend macam you know macam
more than friend ah macam gitu
cakap no lah we are just friend apa tu semua
yes tu pun fifty fifty ah
sometimes some sometimes girls also dia orang just take advantage of guys macam dia orang cannot cannot be lonely
apa seh berbual pasal tu tapi tengok map wah you search for her ah

fickle minded siak perempuan ni

tak apa lah mungkin tak ada jodoh ke
god promise you to give you err reward you something macam something better
ya when the time is right is your turn gitu eh
okay lagi two minute
ya nak
mm ya nak ada lagi nak
best ah berbual dengan safian satu jam ni
kita kita kalau buat podcast kan kita selalu senyap
you know zuhairi dengan
siapa tu nama dia hafidz
dia orang berbual for like ya dia punya podcast okay dah habis
okay bye dah
baik baik how are you
ya my husband want me to jaga anak-anak and don't want me to work wah so good right my husband
oh wah like that leceh lah
then masak for my husband and kids then ya I feel safer for that lah
aiya tanggungjawab mah tak apa lah boleh
eh batuk-batuk pula
five days is so long imagine you sakit then after that you kena five days
eh tapi
you pernah kena sakit ke
tak ada special queue ke untuk kita
ah tengok lah bila my husband on leave cause ke sebab sekarang kan december holiday kan
ya that's true so sebab tu lah then government baru kasih seratus dolar untuk kita jalan-jalan
oh go lah I see like ada staycation then um holiday then I saw my friend kat facebook lah dia tulis dia cakap dia
for kids one they they get this hundred dollars ke you see lah I haven't got the chance to redeem it
ya lor tapi complain cakap yang ini mahal lah
because staycation is known to everyone that memang mahal but I think
government dah kasih duit tu is good enough
hais susah lah I'm waiting for the COVID to go off so I can
malaysia sepatutnya kasih singaporean masuk I think january but I think sebab case dia orang tiba-tiba naik I don't think it will come that fast lah
the I think the quality got a bit better tapi the inside you can actually put the filter
then the dia punya outer layer yang kena mulut tu is actually very silky so I tak sure lah benda tu really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
ya tapi surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
oh yang apa tu makan dekat seoul garden ke apa tu eh
oh my that one to bring like what the whole family macam reunion dinner
ya lah but tapi orang-orang ni pun kena lah jaga apa um the
jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok lah asyik lupa jer apa nak cakap
um jaga
whatever the government say kena ikut but the problem is I think kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three pun masih belum ada apa-apa so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
ya talking about parents kan my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out lah sebab
tapi the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
mm lagi kat got orchard then now what dia orang punya christmas period I think tak ada lah mesti orang-orang ni mesti still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
you know banyak malaysian kerja kat sini kan
they don't have any place to sleep over at uh singapore sekarang
ya lah that's true tapi at least dia orang come up with some um apa tu nama dia solution for the malaysian lah I heard that they give um
oh eh you think ah the people who come to singapore yang malaysia yang
dia orang nak hantar barang you know like those barang-barang kita mostly datang dari malaysia pe
like the sayur like all those foods lah you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
mm eh you remember or not yang masa the first time yang COVID nineteen ni um keluar at news then they were asking for people to be yang swabbers
eh you have any friends working for that or not sebab dia orang tak train kan
wah but I think most of these people yang
jadi swabbers ni maybe dia orang kehilangan kerja kan
then apa dia wear those um protective gear
wah leceh juga eh but I really pity those yang
kena berhenti kerja then they have like what two three anak to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what um home
hmm I think also um government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know lah some of us ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time sebab
like losing their mask so sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids tapi of course it's a added cost lah imagine sekarang berapa fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal tau
macam mana tu very expensive to have a surgical mask
eh so you don't have plans ah for the december tak ambil leave ke maybe plan outing with your family ke
sebab iya lah special day kan mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan
but tu lah COVID lah restricted
betul lah for me pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang kan so for me my family kita nak pergi staycation
kesian budak-budak kan dia orang
okay selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu um then birthday cake then kalau saya time
bulan puasa tu saya sempat lah buat kuih raya untuk orang yang order tapi saya buat untuk small scale jer lah kan sebab government pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk family friends only
kalau masak usually I will just cook uh whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like mi bandung um nasi lemak you know those normal stuff sampai tak tahu nak masak apa
betul juga um before this I realised that after the
tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu deprive others lah untuk beli makan tambahan then you imagine if let's say gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya
ya tapi mana lah orang ni nak ikut undang-undang so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest lah
ah ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid
semua sekarang online
doing the delivery like grab apa lagi eh deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
so I think people with uh young kids sepatutnya maybe could just do something else lah
eh kita ni asyik cakap pasal government aje dah lah kita cakap pasal makanan pula lah mm I'm hungry already do you want to eat
uh eh I saw like they have uh kentang
with kentang then yourself is
but by having this kind of high tech technology eh you see for older generation yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
cause you imagine orang-orang tua lagi they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh you know do the normal stuff like even going down
keluar to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage lah not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us lah orang-orang muda macam kita
at this point you how do I say eh macam
mm betul
mm betul tu
tapi saya rasa kalau um mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar
then expose diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin inshallah dia orang boleh buat
mm betul tu
mm tak apa lah awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli handphone yang
mungkin boleh guna handphone yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada handphone ace samsung ace saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya lah
tapi saya rasa pun di rumah orang tua not much of um they don't have internet access so that's why nak kena beli line which is also an added cost
sebab mereka tak use internet ah data as much as us kan kalau kita facebook instagram baca news uh semua lah
tapi masalahnya saya tak rasa macam awak cakap tak ramai lah yang mempelajari barang-barang baru seperti ini
mm mungkin
ya tapi saya rasa mungkin lama lagi kot
dengan malaysia begitu indonesia dan ingat tak hong-kong baru-baru ni dia orang nak buka hong-kong balik tapi tak jadi sebab ada about other infection case
ya oh cakap pasal ni saya teringat tentang
saya rasa dia orang pun tak ada bazar lah
sedih kan
tapi saya rasa kalau bila dah fasa ketiga dia orang in naikkan number of people to lapan
saya tidak tahu macam mana sebab saya rasa penat juga duduk di singapore sahaja
mm keluar especially bangkok kan
tak apa lah saya rasa saya nak buat staycation nanti
betul juga tapi tu lah staycation in singapore very expensive but it's okay end of the year
tidak risau dan also um
tu macam safe safe apa tu saya tak nampak lah
oh dah macam police ya mereka
wah dia orang dah pusing sini berapa kali
mm apa tugasan mereka yang patut mereka buat kerana saya rasa
tak ada benda yang mereka harus report then
a bit of waste manpower pula
ah oh ya baru saya ingat yang masa period tu
ada berapa video yang keluar pasal auntie uncle kat luar
mm then ada yang tak nak pakai mask susah lah nak nasihatkan orang
okay lah cuma kesian kat orang berbaju merah ni apa nama dia lagi
tapi yang um rasanya ada baju mereka tu ada yang letak mungkin
saya okay jer ah tengok tu dia tengah bebual dengan pakcik tu
pakcik tu tak pakai mask lah
sekejap ya saya check dalam app
so macam bud okay
but then how they make money in the first place kau tahu tak
ya I think there are people who like macam every three weeks they will go for a haircut
wah if I wah cannot afford ah rabak seriously
the haircuts lah I just go to normal neighbourhood barber shops like bawah block punya
and the pakcik will cut your hair and it's really I think that's more comforting ah cause cause I see all these young people do ah and then the places
that they make the shop that they make ah is very intimidating you know you know like sometimes you takut you know you'll be like
eh what's this ah why they all this abang-abang like
then the pakcik will be like eh ah sekolah eh
then like oh sekolah ke kerja then like oh kerja ah oh ni
wah gila eh thirty days
ya but to me it's a very weird weird experience ah cause for us singaporeans cause we we always lepak what like every weekend we always see each other we are lucky to be in singapore where where things are like small then we can travel everywhere within one hour then we also have our own friends that we always hang out with
but then sekali kena the circuit breaker
cannot lepak lah cannot do this cannot do that lah but then we still lepak at zoom ah so is uh I don't know ah it's very it's very weird feeling I hope
semangat lah want to still want to lepak cause I know is is ah very very difficult for other people also ah those who no got no support from friends during this circuit breaker wah that one rabak that one sure rabak
then some more if you stay in a family then you don't like the family I mean your family everytime gaduh everytime quarrel wah that one more more worse sia that one

so that that was the part when I actually eh ah you ask you ask me cake because you didn't mention macaron lagi so it was just cake
but I I didn't know the the macaron was choose a'ah sebab tu saya tanya
but she didn't say what oh it's a mix eh macaron dia mix colour jer ah
is it oh you can choose different like I I I I don't eat macarons always so saya a bit lost
tapi flavour no no no awak macam banyak-banyak flavour does it incur cost ataupun sama jer harga
oh okay I thought macam
oh it's not like semua satu satu satu macam err what you call it alternate macam selang-seli ah tak eh okay okay
mana dapat contact
orh abeh dia punya review is good
so the cake tak sedap ah
abeh the thing is kita tak boleh try dulu ke abeh macam gini a bit
oh by right kita boleh datang and taste correct so kalau kalau kita order sikit dia tak they don't sell macam kek tu a small portion that we can buy and taste
inshaa allah lah takde apa-apa lah can lah
so that is cake that is done dah habis
huh I don't apa yang two hour frame err saya tak faham
two hour time frame I think in advanced for them to get there I think oh okay I think I saya rasa they need to get there dorang nak kena stack up nak kena susun they need two hours for it to get ready so that means dalam macam they need to be there by six or something like that by seven they need to do the susun ah that's why they need two hours just in case tak it's a buffer time
okay ah I I could be right betul saya rasa ada chance betul
but because usually cake tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu they need to susun letak and then they macam ah tu lah a'ah ah mmhmm
cause I saw the message your mum macam nanti letak something decoration or something like that apa tu dia nak apa
dia nak apa your mum nak suruh macam jangan plain gitu ah so ada ada decoration
biar lah by the way tadi nabil call call you first eh dia call you first is it
oh okay K K K K so I think I think dia macam terperanjat ah I think oh I haven't answer their question so dia call saya saya dia cakap actually I talked to hakimmah oh then I macam eh asal dia call saya tak sempat ya tak kari instant tu kira baru letak baru letak dia message saya tak sempat nak message dia dah dah reply awak pun dah keep asking questions terus saya macam eh okay wait
tak awak terus tak awak terus ah terus you mmhmm ah correct ah correct mmhmm so dia terus err awak terus reply balik tak sempat saya nak baru nak type kira uh okay I was about to type sekali awak terus dah uh I didn't I don't know the answer it's like oh okay I was I was about to tell you yang he mention uh okay this is what he said to me lah dia cakap
I don't know I tak sempat
then you told your mum to delete atau dia just dia paiseh tak I think what nabil is trying to accommodate dia dia cakap yang macam orang tak makan macam those who are working for the wedding they will try to put as crew uh huh that's what he said lah that's why kalau apa-apa
so anyway yang tadi dia cakap err dia kata kalau I think I think the ambassador tanya ke apa he say just tell them they are part of the crew jer he will also say lah they part of the crew that's what he told me mm so kira it's like macam we have to be on the same page ah dia cakap gitu jer
oh ah okay I thought she gonna ask question I I I was wondering apasal I didn't save your mum's number tadi saya tengah macam terfikir ni siapa I it's either I it's a the the the boss atau your mum so I was looking at it okay you added it then that number belongs to your mum I should save it
so cepat that was very fast I think she she posted lama eh maybe I was saya yang lambat lah
oh ya homework besok besok besok besok besok I besok saya ada site then sekejap jer pukul tiga ah then after that dah boleh insha allah pasal besok I
ya we can do like this also on friday ke
to dia punya problem friday friday should be okay I think
tu ah
pasal belum confirm pe pasal kalau awak dah pilih that means saya pilih jer I think you go with your mum first
mm once dah confirm
oh jadi nanti next time kalau tidak bila saya datang pun dia nak kena okay tak dia tapi dia ada intention to go any other places tak lepas tu
tak ah kita
tak payah lah kita keep to the minimum kalau saya ikut begum jer settle
ah let your mum choose lah takpe
tadi dia datang ah dia datang petang pe lambat terus a'ah dia daripada site so dia datang dia datang terus dia cakap eh uh hakimmah hakimmah minta aku favour tolong terus saya I just senyum jer ah tanya tolong apa jadi emcee eh a'ah seh aku the last time jadi emcee was poly time seh dia cakap gitu ah that's what he said
I just say like macam takde lah apa yang susah sangat engkau cuma cakap okay sekarang sudah mah that's why saya cakap senang jer kau announce macam sekarang sudah masuk waktu azan dah lepas tu kau cakap okay sekarang kita nak akad nikah ah boleh ramai-ramai duduk gitu jer bukan kau suruh suruh berbual-bual interact takde I told him no you don't have to do that you just need to talk bila benda dia nak jadi kau bilang just inform jadi orang macam uh takpe takpe takpe takpe aku nak berbual pasal hakimmah ngan kau I macam merepek you know lah him you know lah him he always likes to macam kacau-kacau takpe takpe aku ada aku
a'ah dia abeh dia kata aku make sure hafiz S pun kena get involved I don't know biar biar jangan lepas tu then he said jangan jangan dia menggigil sudah
tapi I think yang yang yang pasal sound system I don't know they allow us to touch or not sometimes ada orang tak pasal dia dia ya sometimes they they don't allow you to touch you know
usually they don't allow to touch ah tapi kalau kita tahu
I think provided kalau takde event before that that means we can come early tau macam pasal slot before us is kosong uh
so okay lah maybe macam cake semua boleh set up siang kalau kalau let's say uh grab time
syafiq dengan rahmat um kalau ada kereta boleh lah dorang tengokkan kalau tak siapa lagi seh tengok rahmat is a actually syafiq dengan rahmat boleh lah syafiq boleh ambil awak atau rahmat can just stay there
ya but the plan is sekarang kakak cakap amirul will take care dengan bapa semua jadi itu part so kita kita focus on our side jer
that's why I think I set up saya pakai kat situ juga so that means
tu lah okay
boleh lah as in kita I don't know how is the rule I don't know macam mana kan semua
ya lah correct that means baru saya datang from home kat situ pula ya ya ya a'ah
so that means I tak macam gini tau you can pakai baju kat situ tau eh actually dah boleh pakai baju makeup yang pakai kat sana
makeup oh kira dah kat sana juga eh like that
kalau kalau tidak I I don't know for my side ada pak andam ke tidak ah ataupun pakai macam mana pakaian so kalau tidak
it's that atau I get is isn't it groom
from what I know eh kadang tak ada pak andam uh usually they will show mungkin kalau kalau groom tu nanti they will show the groom atau someone who's gonna be close to me how to wear it kalau dia boleh catch up boleh pick up then tak payah so after that dia pakaikan kalau tidak then that means nak kena get kakak punya kawan tu ah yang siapa I don't know georgie ke sofian I think that that's the name something like that that guy boleh buat dia memang a'ah
eh uh kalau rizal ada
eh uh kalau rizal ada okay ah tak the thing is dia nak kena ada orang yang tahu kalau ada orang tahu senang kalau takde nanti eh macam mana nak pakai ah pasal dia nak kena ikat
tak tahu I think tak lah actually the best tapi the best is belajar dulu
tak the thing is you need to teach who kalau teach sendiri saya boleh buat sendiri it's simple as that tapi dia nak kena pin kan ikat kan
that's why just just need to learn jer everything on YouTube most sekarang correct
oh malay dance ajar ikat kain eh
okay anyway tadi kita tulis
tak actually dia simple jer dia ikatkan sekejap jer dia ikatkan tu jer tak payah pegang apa-apa dia ikat tu dah then I can go off already I don't know nak kena pakai makeup I don't need to wear makeup pe kan
ada orang macam eh touch up touch up okay wait sabar are you going to put inai
lelaki tak payah lah tak perlu kalau tak nak boleh
what do you think saya kalau boleh tak payah lah inai tapi ah ya I I I just don't want to nanti
ya lah kalau cakap tak mahu nanti your mum pakai lah inai bukan okay tu kekok
uh okay kita tengok apa jawapan dulu
actually lelaki tak perlu
mm tak pakai tak payah lah okay the we were talking about prep time for wedding then after that what else what other questions
apa food oh ya
lepas saya akad nikah doa tentu ada kalau amik gambar usually I don't know ah your abang ambil gambar macam mana pasal ada orang ambil gambar okay ambil gambar dengan card
is it uh tak tahu ah kalau ikut macam standard eh orang kahwinnya eh macam dorang yang biasa ambil gambar kahwin dengan tok kadi nanti ambil gambar dengan certificate tu ah yang kahwin lepas tu nanti kat be safe dorang macam ambil doa and then uh doa suami isteri what you want to do ah macam ada doa between the two of us ada ah there is a doa a'ah ada doa ada sunnah tak tak not depan orang ah saya pasal saya sarongkan cincin pe lepas tu ada doa that part pun ada gambar so kita gitu gedebak-gedebuk maybe eight thirty eight forty five itu jer about macam
asal kita tak kita tak takde takde apa-apa pun makan jer lepas tu
family tak okay kita kasi makan eh masa makan tu okay nanti turn by turn turn by turn kita maybe
boleh lah makan I think ya kita pasal sekejap nanti after that kita lima the thing is kita lima puluh orang jer kita tak pergi mana-mana we're not gonna move around should be okay
a'ah I think they will serve on the table already this nanti dorang dah habis terus dia duduk
okay maybe maybe kita kasi dorang makan I think pun tak makan lama pun setengah twenty minutes then after that orang kasi makan macam twenty minutes kita pun makan kita makan orang makan jadi kita semua makan ah jadi jadi ya lah that's why I say kita makan dorang makan dah makan terus ambil gambar ambil gambar baru kita potong kek last last part macam gitu
is it I don't know oh makeup semua eh oh a'ah lah okay probably macam go by table by table ah
got go ah mm we call out table by table ah as in macam mesti lima orang go ah a'ah ah ya correct correct correct

okay dah
ada ada kat you give the link pasal you just put you make a list on your spotify my my spotify ah then after that in sequence we'll be playing
okay from what I know ah eh macam venue gini kalau awak tak ada emcee dia err takde emcee usually what what usually kalau awak engage emcee there will be a the emcee it's either he can control ah ya lah this is what I know lah ataupun you will use your own relative to control the mic ah that's what they allow mm mm mm mm
okay actually kalau dia set setakat untuk berbual pe set kan untuk berbual just fade up fade down jer pe pelan-pelan jer tak payah kuat-kuat kita lima puluh orang lagu-lagu ah ya lah correct
play the song ah fade up lagu sikit mmhmm
a'ah boleh
tak tahu apa board
oo yang Yamaha kecil punya berapa
should be lah that one tak kan besar oh wait dia dia masukkan dekat sound board oh okay okay I saw already I saw the speaker on a yang okay speaker dia boleh tahan enough lah to cover then the board jer saya tak nampak okay lah takpe lah
lagu jer I think tak payah main kuat-kuat then the the list of song actually I have a few songs ah
standard lah qasidah-qasidah relax relax I think before that saya saya actually tengah tunggu nak maghrib tu saya saya nak tunggu maghrib tu saya nak suruh ustaz hakeem err kalau ustaz hakeem datang ah I just want him to recite a few qasidah tengah tunggu recite qasidah tapi takut dia paiseh dia sorang mm mm
a'ah sebelum nikah so sambil sambil tunggu tu qasidah sikit baca doa tapi boleh ah I think can do doa selamat while waiting pasal nanti bukan doa selamat ah baca zikir ustaz hakeem memang sorang pun dia power tapi kalau ustaz hakeem pegang mic tak kesah dulu dia okay tapi selalunya ustaz hakeem kalau pegang mic ah wahab dah start godeh board that's what I know kalau ustaz hakeem masuk jer dia godeh board
mm tak usually kalau kalau wahab dah godeh board correct correct usually wahab kalau godeh board dia will do as in general jer enough kalau uh ustaz hakeem dia adakan echo lah but it takes a while pe to get it kita tengok macam mana lah tapi
usually I think ustaz boleh baca qasidah sikit ke atau berzikir I think actually okay usually he likes to do that lah it would be nice jadi tak nervous sangat aku terima nikahnya aku terima nikah
firdaus hari-hari seh sekarang jumpa aku jumpa like he keep saying aku terima aku terima dia keep saying dia dia pasal dia nya dah nak dekat
tak dia tak stressful dia kata just sekarang ingat jer ah macam main-main main-main ah just main-main the with the thing jadi bila on the day dah macam kat lidah pe just hujung hujung aku terima nikah nama nama nama dengannya okay pasal that's how you practise you just keep saying it as in as in it's normal lama lama terus okay like that

I don't know if their they they they can switch to YouTube music ah hopefully lah we can we can always ask boleh can switch between switch between the two mmhmm I think they gonna let us use the laptop I think they gonna let use the laptop sebab tu dia kata can use the video montage
I think that one that one from my that one my side your one sirih dara kakak I think kakak ada contact ah I think can ask the guy
oh okay then keep to your mum contact dah
gubahannya tray
actually actually the gift the gift semua kita kasi kat dorang dorang settle kan kan that's what I know
kalau kita sewa dulang a'ah a'ah
a'ah dulang hantaran lah kan I want to to say to you
oh you want to buy that dulang

okay wait pasal kelmarin kakak cakap yang kawan dia tu georgie semua amirul dah contact pasal dia yang pinjamkan dia yang ada dulang tu so kalau kita ada barang tu semua kita kasi pada dia kan dia siapkan then on the day kita tinggal ambil jer semua dah siap
okay okay kalau kalau kalau betul your mum nak beli do your own ada time tak kalau kalau
tak pasal kelmarin kakak already told me yang dia tu pernah buat I saw yang dulang kakak punya ah dorang they
is it I don't know kita tak I don't know
kita belum discuss pe pasal dulang
ya takpe lah tu that one can discuss later lah for this one
jap eh
oh ya know not yang firdaus punya venue he said he told me eh aku venue yes dia buat tiga ratus
pasal ah tapi dia cakap fifty by fifty that's why I said saya cakap kita punya tak boleh dia kata pasal shah ibrahim was daring enough to
ya lah fifty at one time so that means somehow pasal I think most of the venue don't want to take the risk fifty fifty fifty pun still the same people pe keep coming kan so I think most venue don't want they just do fifty jer so I think shah ibrahim somehow
but but because that time tak silap saya dia cakap adik eh mak dia pergi maknya firdaus ni went for the wedding one of the cousin wedding it already happening lah shah ibrahim allow macam said ah uh the mum saw dia punya invite is I think about a few hundred so ada orang ambassador eh no I think orang or ambassador is down there to uh overlook kat depan ah he standing in front ah ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct I think that's I think that's how he managed to convince them ah as in okay you can see at how we provide lah I think that's the procedure macam gitu
dia datang mmhmm mmhmm tapi memang
itu I told him I saya tanya firdaus dah habis kau pak saudara-mara kau pun yang jaga tak [ah] I think he will
dia pakai mesin tu pe remember that thing
abeh kita nak kena kita nak kena submit name eh
for us to make ah because we know oh no pasal kita tahu pe who are our guests dah itu jer
fifty people okay lah considered as our guest list ah but for us also our part is to just record lah nama kalau apa-apa jadi pun just pump kasi nama jer correct who are coming we just record itu ah itu jer correct
no of course not siapa nak subscribe
that's why then asal tak pakai awak punya
I know I remember but just I was I was doing I was writing down something dah
tripod small tripod stand small tau very small kecil punya kecil betul-betul kecil for the cam ah kan ada dia ada yang
use the same wi-fi to sync I don't know need to try I I I need to google I need to do a bit of research I don't know need to check cause from what I saw yesterday was using but then probably boleh pakai on by wi-fi kalau by wi-fi that means boleh gerak orang just hold dekat jer anyway it's really small kecil gila so it's easy ah to hold it kalau tidak orang pakai chest pack ah
tak pasal you have to face it have to face that's why dia punya screen face us macam very awkward awkward lah you have to see yourself I don't want
that now but like abeh laptop dia the thing is the laptop is big you have to keep shifting around orang leceh seh nak pegang kalau benda tu kecil dia boleh pegang pakai tangan and then just turn left right turn left right jer which is more better rather than you shift the whole screen every time just to adjust angle
work from home and then besok I got one site pukul tiga
tak ah sekejap jer pergi site
saya saya pergi site survey that's it takde pergi office
ya lah about one hour nya tempat pasal ni bukan really pasal dia macam just resurvey kita dah ada barang tu just need to shift it somewhere a proper location like in another location ah mm mmhmm
ya ya should be sempat lah it cannot be that long
sama macam fajr juga I think it's just a stage where
tak pasal tangan mak kakak I think tangan terus pump jadi tahu I think you can never spare the kid
mm tapi bukan
I think bukan pukul sampai sakit pukul just to ah
ah even even even macam just just to macam sepak pakai tangan pun macam just like that just dia tahu dia eh kena jadi dia tahu eh sakit okay so stop a'ah lah mm bukan sampai lah dera banting takde lah not like that
anyway tadi yang the video I send to you was too long
oh that's why you said it was too long but but actually it's quite good lah it it gives macam ustaz tu used to I went I used to went for his classes last time
ustaz madarrus he used to be in singapore now he's I think at mmhmm mm so I went for his classes last time ada cerita juga lah cerita dia so anyway he's quite good honestly kalau tanya saya baik so the the sister ask you saw the question right the sister ask about men
not being good leaders that kind of thing ah and then he he agree to it lah and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be macam have a leadership have leadership ah responsibility like old people dorang kan ada responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay ah simply put I also understand ah dia cakap macam nowadays err parents okay macam dia cakap parents usually perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan very strict semua tak boleh ya dia macam partly part
exactly pasal dorang apply to girls that's why tu dia cakap and then
mm then yang itu that's the problem pasal I think believe dulu orang kampung macam macam mana pun nanti kalau orang-orang lama pun ah nanti macam mana pun they will still start teaching the boys to tak responsibility kau nak kena jaga adik kau macam gitu
macam wah bagus pe kau bagus macam the the the biasness eh biasness
tak tahu ah I think sekarang happening to us is the modern and then we are too exposed dengan
ya lah western it's come from western that's why dulu orang kampung dia cakap budak-budak lelaki they they they become matured faster pasal the dad I I think the further the behind part they explain a lot of things ah macam it the mother also play a role dia kata macam not to strike not strike fear tau macam to gain respect for macam the mother hold the status of the father macam make the status among the the children they fear the father fear the father macam respect tau yes pasal dia cakap macam
mm abeh yes dia kata macam dulu orang cakap bapa balik jer tak payah bapa cakap balik nampak bapa balik takde tunggu straightaway masuk rumah punya bapa tak payah tenung pun dia step tak nampak jer automatically come home you know pasal automatically the father have this respect already abeh macam the mum dia kata hold this status macam okay ni bapa kau punya cawan kau jangan pegang macam ini pinggan bapa kau punya kau jangan makan dari bapa kau punya pinggan macam the mother so dia macam keep dia gitu tau so dia kata the father is the leader of the family and the mother is the leader of the household and children macam gitu so but overall it's still the father ah so dia kata nowadays even the father lack that macam I don't know what happened lah but then dia kata the fathers just lack lack
abeh dia kata yes ah tu ah he was talking about that also that was that one thing also
then then he said then he also mentioned mentioned this thing ah men have ego and men always wanted to be needed faham kan wants to be needed
yes that's the thing perempuan asyik I want I'm independent dia kata tak boleh the the rule of a man is to be needed kalau kau take away that he's not needed dia a very yes that's one thing ataupun dia punya ego mati nanti dia terus macam abeh dia kata that's why a lot people fall into depression pasal guy not needed women are independent dia cakap gitu that that's the tapi it's a this is the theory ah
dia kata ya
dia kata tak the thing is macam dia dia kata ada there was this one person who came up to me ustaz I'm married I have children and then I I don't have a problem but the main problem is my husband dia cakap gitu so actually I can earn my own money but I don't need him but I don't know why I'm married lepas tu ustaz tak boleh cakap apa-apa I don't know why I'm married macam I think it's just pasal no the thing is she is a woman tak bukan tak sayang I think over time dia ada children dia busy kerja they live too long together you get tired of the guy get tired of the guy something like that
okay wait kalau you have a kids that means you separate from your kids ah just the two of
the bond ah the bond together ah macam have adventures ah
develop again ah oh ya rekindle ah kira ada semangat membara balik
tak okay eh I think it's easy to say the thing is it's easy to say tau but then kalau awak tengok eh the context of singapore in the context of singapore susah you see eh sekarang jer to survive some you you look at the household lelaki bini nak kena
activity lah a'ah ya correct tak payah spend money ya just to macam cycling I can yes yes mmhmm mm
tetapi kan mm tapi still and then macam this kind of thing is one of the thing tapi macam dalam every day tu macam kalau boleh macam dapat solat jemaah macam malam together that would be ya that that how the ya that that's how you ah mmhmm that's like how to
ya lah nowadays ya lah tapi mak cakap
ya boleh boleh tak salah a'ah boleh memang boleh macam saya solat jemaah kat masjid mm
mm can ah ya boleh kan dah cakap macam suami nak gi dia suka sembahyang jemaah kat masjid so just go solat masjid jemaah balik dia imamkan isteri lagi ah boleh no nothing wrong with that pasal isteri have to do her chores abeh dia nak solat jemaah pe kesian kan solat lah bagus think this kind of thing can can can keep ourselves
a'ah lah tapi
tapi macam macam firuz mm macam firuz he likes to solat macam firuz is see so far lah firuz and amira like to solat jemaah so I think they don't want to solat sendiri-sendiri so which is good also lah
kadang-kadang firuz bawa solat tapi firuz punya al-fatihah good seh saya kadang-kadang macam eh you haven't pray ah you pray on your own first lepas tu saya dengarkan lah I correct him then it's okay

ah yes yes you know Nina Sazali pernah uh buat kan she show all her piles of dead buyers you know
ya cause dia dia punya she showed ah
it's been like two months now I'm still having like less than twenty viewers and that day yang si cousin aku tu first time live jer daripada shop yang tu jer dah macam
ada banyak juga terjual ah abaya dia dia buat abaya is like thirty eight dollars you know the abaya
aku tak I didn't watch uh I didn't watch the punya live sampai habis cause aku pun malas kan
ah aku memang I'm very moody ah on that last week I was very moody ah I was not on the what is it called on the I don't know I'm I was feeling down I was feeling down last week I don't know maybe cause of that negative punya experience you know
and then and then we had Aminah Muslim punya experience and then cousin aku punya campur aduk with the abaya stuff
ya the last yang four hundred dollars three hundred seventy seven some sort like that
she ya still got balance the last balance was three hundred over lah nak dekat four hundred so that was from her mother-in-law at last ah macam she like I don't know ah I I feel like she's like gali lubang apa tutup lubang eh abeh gali lagi
maybe ah babe you know what the the the punya tu is registered under her husband name of course lah mother-in-law dia tolong seh
and bo pian cause this one is a big money seh but I think eh dia dah scam orang lain dulu tau but I don't know lah aku try to search in Facebook about her background whatever kan so far nobody viral her you know why
kita punya barang or not you get what I mean or not
this thing will be like very sampai satu kali dia tak boleh bayar satu orang ni kan then I think the person will viral her
I don't know for me right cause she refunded us she got a lot of evidence nanti dia cakap dia ada evidence lah gedebak gedebuk lah you know but maybe ah kalau ada satu orang cakap anyone has any dealing with Aminah Muslim before muslimah before maybe I think a lot of people will comment
ya husnuzon lah mm
I mean ya I try but I'm not gonna order from her anymore the thing is I'm angry with her I'm quite upset cause she mentioned that I am dia punya regular customer which is which I my first time seh
how can you share a my conversation with another person saying that I'm to to to show that you are konon honest gitu lah kan
oh cause ah aku baca dia cakap nak kena uh only uh berapa percent jer melayu
no no melayu nak kena kurang daripada English actually
yes that's right so that's why you've been talking melayu all the way kan ah so you have to you cannot dia macam nak kena ada sixty percent of uh I think it's lower
so apa ni uh so that's why lah aku rasa macam
ah aku quite upset with her cause she you know she just mentioned my name without apa ni
suka suka cakap aku ni macam dia cover up her her her apa
ya cause she also mentioned to the person yang dia punya husband is not working for a few months already
the the one who sustain the business is the one yang dia scam kita you get what I mean or not
at times at times dia bukan kat situ at times bapa her father-in-law dia mother-in-law dia melayu
and laki dia melayu
uh huh dewa
ah all the Malay punya ni ah
mm so maybe she but but the person who uh the the refunded yang one K tu dia pergi dia dah pergi kedai dia
she was there but the second time that she came down it was the bapa mertua
ah yes so that's why she doesn't want to make a scene dia keluar daripada kedai tu dia tunggu si Aminah Muslim ni dekat dah lah aku tak tahu nama dia betul Aminah Muslim ke tak padahal dia put Aminah Muslim aje agaknya
and then after that dia apa ni uh she buy time again ah buy time
she doesn't even have actually supposedly that time she have to pay seven hundred okay sekali terus dia cakap ah I only have
ya lah she scam another person lah babe she go and advertise she say who want to buy wholesale then people like us macam aku will go and message her and then she will say oh minimum this kind of amount thirteen dollars per piece you know that kind of thing
then uh in fact um this Aminah Muslim right uh the the other the other party who was also scammed by her ah dia also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
the the Thai suppliers told her that Aminah Muslim tak order langsung
so which sources and then Aminah Muslim Aminah Muslim ni macam cakap uh please show me the message macam dia ada cakap buat apa aku nak show kau message tu seh
dia kena buku dengan ruas eh yang orang suka kaki viral eh she will get it ah confirm
that's why that's why macam kita have to apa orang kata ambil sikit-sikit ah cuma aku nak tahu juga si Lia tu dapat daripada mana ni
mm that one is a love your style that one is love your style dia punya Facebook
oo okay I saw the the advertisement also she have a few uh few uh apa ni baju which is the same
twenty five lah dia tu
mm I hope this one is true lah at least we have a you know direct supplier yang trustable lah you know
I already told her just give us uh new design you tell us lah cause malaysia punya boleh dapat lebih cepat apa
mm I'm not sure tapi tengok daripada Thai Thai punya supply juga I think
eh have you seen that patchwork that retro patchwork yang the baru punya retro marble ah
uh yang si Sadiah tu pun bawa and I saw a few others yang bawa
this it's it's pleated but it's the same like marble design but the colours are more glaring yang dia ni pun ada tunjuk aku Jenny ni dia ada tunjuk aku juga the colours lah but I I I feel like we already have the marble right right
ni pun tengok tengok ni lah babe tengok rezeki orang ah
ya ada yang big pleats ada yang smaller pleats
ada yang macam the quality yes ada yang termasuk
ya for me aku rasa yang macam ada tunic tu tunic is also considered as pleats kan tapi dia tak macam pleats sangat kau faham tak macam dia ada spread
ya cause I think the ruffle dress is pendek
just put it at Nina Sazali it will be a hot kicks lah for us habis lah
ah like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever I don't have that dream to to make it into a shop macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke I don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead kau nak kena ada manpower
macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa you know just on and as and when
ya so that's why for me when I do this um online thingy it's actually for for aku to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
yes true cause my kids are still small I I'm I'm also working in the morning you see so I don't see maybe like flea market I'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off punya event
but I think if you buy the garment kau tahu you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
berapa dah lima puluh ke kau eh fifty eh okay oh ya you're forty now ah
eh age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even Saadiah ah she said lah next year kita buka kedai lah I was like seriously
dia nak boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big ah you know like inside my heart oh no way I'm not gonna dream that big you know
but then again I I think that she is like what you know semangat lima minit kind of person
oh kucing ah oh okay cat fighting ya
okay so like like I said lah so I mean I'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but I'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like berkinja-kinja you know at the live she used my words like wanita lindungan kaabah all these you know and then but with me huh pening lah pening lah pening lah over here pening over there pening
the other one is the lady's punya ah um dia punya apa ni ah anak mmhmm
ya tak ada hati ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class meh cause I don't have any I got a condo maybe you get what I mean like for me lah never mind lah I mean we can find our own supplies I mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know memang we never come out with a lot of money lah but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can lah mm
one one person one person one who really wanted so I I already told her that one is the Saadiah punya friend ah she wanted to buy she messaged me just now
nanti barang tak datang and then after that people will chase us I don't like all these you know I don't want to drama drama
ya my my mother side a lot eh my mother nya auntie dia punya buat downline banyak seh eh I think eh this thing is very good lah sarah I mean I'm the one who eat it right
I'm not saying to promote my my item lah but then again I feel that this is good Roslan makan pun he can find energy ya
ya he took ah sarah eh dia kerja malam kan dalam pukul dua belas dia makan kan it can help him to survive until five baru rasa ngantuk
whatever lah I mean if you then then like that is personally lah from my own experience yang I'm having right now I can talk personally to people outside lah without putting it in my Facebook right
dia macam tak kasi aku apa macam maintain ah maintain maintain my weight so far lah aku dah cause dia kasi kita process kan kita punya toksin kan
I am I am anti weight machine punya orang I wouldn't even like want want to go up
babe my my auntie kurus nya pun diabetic before that also she like that sia also diabetic it doesn't matter is your the way you eat
but then again ya lah eh just now I cooked asparagus sedap seh that day I get a free asparagus I got asparagus I don't know from um a donation drive from my block
not lah Workers Party punya agaknya
oh wow your husband don't want you to be an influencer I mean I mean you know what when you do this kind of charitable work eh or you know like you make to save the earth save the frog save the animals you know that kind of thing save food you know I mean at the end of the day you're actually giving to um orang yang memerlukan the feeling of that to do this social work is very very apa orang kata ya it's very rewarding in fact it is
ya it takes two hands ah ya I mean but if you have a husband who is quite macam understanding that okay you're doing this for a good cause I mean he will let you go to do this it's good lah you know but I know that some people have different different perspectives of
marriage or you know how they want to control their partner lah or you can become the wanita lindung kaabah lindungan kaabah number three lah never mind lah redha redha
she will be in primary darjah dia baru darjah no darjah empat lah ah darjah it's primary four ya
kan so I don't I don't know ah it's very stress ah fikir kan ni semua
it is it is a must for me to change the school to Tampines cause it's better for her macam dia boleh rest after school cepat balik betul tak the Tampines north is very near to my house
so kalau dia dah balik sekolah dia terus boleh balik you know it's very tiring you primary school primary four abang will be in secondary school so by the time I think he will be home by what four four also now they all have extra extra activities after school right
mm mm mm so I really hope this is really stressing me up also stressing abang up abang doesn't look stressed but I look stressed he was like saying chill lah mak I can do it
tepuk eh tepuk
alright here we are today what's up talking via this audio recording dan juga di zoom recording err macam
kejap ah kau tahu kau punya audio recording apa ni ada there's another additional sounds
so aku tengok lah ada orang orang ni like there're influencers in itself so what happen is when aku tengok dia punya comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
err apa president the vice president
um I mean people have their own perspective and opinion lah but I think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
aku tak sangka that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like oh my god I can't believe this your statement I'm gonna unfollow you
ah itu kau boleh nampak different lah because
from that day onwards I'm sure si trump punya followers pun macam K I'm gonna unfollow you I'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear lah they just love to comments that's why I said there's a lot of them I'm like so surprised
and we just looking to apa ni um barang-barang yang kau boleh beli via Carousell
nak beli eh ya that's crazy man like
plan B lah but sometime good eh kalau kita orang sekarang kena berwawasan sikit
ah macam dia lah dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia very determined eh tak malu ah so this kind of people actually it's good for err business lah actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
uh so I think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he siasat dia punya prime suspect
ya jangan tidur jangan tidur
sabar sama sama so semalam aku knockout then I just bangun balik perasan it's really really damn good movie
ya so kalau korang ingat back in the days err maybe in nineties
kalau korang tengok the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them lah so siapa-siapa try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
so yang dia mati tu eventually it's there's another plot twist lah all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat
apa lagi ya
the nun definitely mata kau buka besar-besar ah
aku lagi cerita yang buat kau thrilled terperanjat untuk kau macam watch all the way yes of course
apa lagi satu eh
there's err conjuring annabelle ada kena mengena kan
oh geram
tu wah rembat tu get so emotional rich
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya err wife remarried so he's not happy go and killed both of them
I think in is not something new ah because before that dia ada tunjukkan eh err lot of accidents or orang gaduh eh gaduh all this
so this man doesn't let her off easily ah kan surrounded with dekat orang gaduh kan so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something kadangkala macam tu tak make sense aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini like kata orang dah you are negative by itself so the banyak amarah yang belum unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing
so he escalated the matter by killing by killing did he ah he killed he killed some of this lady punya
kau pakai earpiece
okay tak nampak ah sekali tak eh
eh kau cerita lah
siapa they met a guy kat reunion
mm mm kan gared gared is the ni mm
I think tu bukan secretary itu attorney also
just pasal dia like junior
to the ni the main err ni lah
so kesian
not bad though that's not bad at all the efforts are um a bit sceptical about it nanti bila tunggu lama sikit
pasal ah kita dah benchmark eh kita dah tengok movie banyak sangat
second mesti ada subtitles because I tend to tak tak I kita tengok macam like where's the subtitle yo and how am I going to understand these they speaking english with slangs and very thick accent ya
five minutes of the says is important so say wrong buat semua terkeliru eh kuat sangat lah kutuk trailer
what else that we do err today oh kita ordered nasi ambeng eh
ah nasi ambeng dia adalah dari sebuah kedai ni
err ya not bad lah err like fifty bucks for two to three pax and then like the entire dulang
uh huh paru sambal goreng
kalau sayur tu kurang least favourite bukan pasal tak suka sayur apa tapi dia tak berapa lembut
ah masak sayur jadi lembut sikit eh
what else did we did today err we'd like to cover ourself with a lot of selimut selimut
selimut bukan semut K in case kau tak dengar so siapa yang tak dengar ni selimut S E L I M U T
ya hujan
hujan pun later started
camera is sleeping and my husband like bedek lah ni bedek dia ni tak kelip mata tak buat apa-apa dia diam jer
but then aku tengok macam makin aku naik makin dia punya tank makin apa dia makin pendek
ya aku ingatlah towards sana lead to somewhere else but no I'm going actually if I didn't end it I'm gonna get myself eaten by the crocodile oh my god crazy you got my adventurous in another way ya
primary four kot that time chill lagi anak-anak kecil ya
anak-anak headache
apa maksud engkau dengan tak berapa takut dengan crocodile
dan kau cakap kalau dia jump macam mana ah jadi aku berwaspada
err aku
I would rather follow the makcik-makcik rombongan you know they just saw take pictures
we saw the makcik eh in the botanical garden
some rabak ah rabak gila ah
monkey mengamuk monyet mengamuk teruk bro
aku belum nampak or tahu satu but aku tahu member guna sepak slap on the face
ya monkey monyet but tu dia same monkey business monyet
ada aku suka yang kecil lah maybe the baby one are cute and friendly and and playful
selamat monyet tu kurang bijak ke tahap that dia tak buka water bottle tu dia tengok takde air dia campak kau balik
ah tapi actually masa dekat bridge tu ni monyet ni dia ada agenda aku dah nampak daripada mata dia
like you better shut dia macam fine lah you better shut up when we're not going to say anything I'm going to jump on her bag I say okay alright go ahead
yes eventually they jump there's err grab a bottle from you lepas aku cakap I tahu kenapa but yang that err he very sneaky and he just noise trying to communicate to me the moment he hop on your bag but he look at me again
aku macam okay bro yo no monkey business
and happily they keep proper padahal air takde air kosong
atau kau just
kurang ajar punya monyet eh
ah nak kasi kasi betul-betul lah
aiyo so crazy oh so now kita nak kena bawa kayu eh to frighten them ah
ah singapore ni monkey kayu jalan weh tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik
oh ya man no kangaroo I got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to macam kasi makan
but I didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me mampus sia ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like uh we bought quite a bit ah tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan seh like we bought like two two or one eh I don't remember
get fed by us ah the the time ah and then ada kasi makanan dia apa so at the end kita kasi dengan
birds and ni kan the ducks
they them datang ah
that's definitely but my um in my thought is like kalau pasal kita balik like
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always nasib kalau kena tak kena but I think this is gonna go higher because they are
we all know COVID is not easy thing for those who kena
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government punya you know command
how how do I put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time macam
kau tahu benda ni dah badly affected and I think when we talk about ke apa kan
ya tapi aku rasa
I don't see that we are macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena push in so macam
atau it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online lah kan
ya there the other thing is your kerja jalan lah unless kau kena micromanaged by your own company ah so
ya man yo so kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit eh lima belas minit ah
and those are not definitely feel macam ah you know I mean
that's not easy you know especially for a pengantin ah
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and err ramai meriahkan wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap I felt that that's how it is lah
unless unless you no need to macam invite people dia macam immediate family kau nak totally buat kecil-kecil just make sure everything sah then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then I think is not the time yet lah kalau kau betul wedding kau grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't lah not the time yet
kalau korang just sebab ada mum is there then just go ahead lah
ya I think kalau cakap sah ni and dia pun ada the elderly lah
so pasal kalau keluar kan orang wear mask kan and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
because that's their main entertainment like kalau dulu kan kita keluar I think they always go out go where pasar geylang ah
ah little india or wherever a shopping mall ke or visiting the bazaar ke ah membawang kan
mengopi lah mengumpat lah whatever lah sekarang stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
okay cerita lama okay
aku nak tengok ni drama perempuan tiada dosa eh perempuan yang tidak berdosa right ya

I were itik
oh okay I had one I I have one tak apa nanti aku share
err then err there was one in a masjid ah eh was it masjid or apa eh
ya because kita how to say like want to you know like perform we don't care about the world bro kita just like want to perform like really perform and then done
which was a bit macam irritating ah kan okay at that point of time um
err from my father's point of view ah kan okay then no no no kira in my father's point of view it was irritating ah
like err I think kira macam macam back then right um probably he was a
maybe he was tired then we got him at the wrong time so so dia bingit ah kan
eh my memory ah kan okay so um remember not we used to go to err rumah mak long for another purpose

and then and then they will macam err terbawa-bawa abeh that's it
ah abeh then the next day they are your enemy ya
yes because okay err before okay before kita continue dengan kau punya music err current music err you err current music are you listening to
we used to grow up with macam err punk rock right punk rock then the ska then there's reggae and what what not right
era tu kira that time ah kan that era so but um
what got err kira-kira while how did you get into err this like current music that you are listening to
ya because I like to ask questions kan ah macam tak ah but because err like that time err like I really enjoyed macam
the fact that you were on drums because you knew what you were doing that's the most important part about being a drummer you just have to know what you're doing yang penting
kau terror
yang penting kau terror eh
dan sekarang kau main guitar
huh iya ke
yang penting kita terror bro
guitars ya macam okay because susah datang ah like it's usually okay when the macam drummers they will stick to macam drums all the way like throughout their lives drum drum drum drum drum then um
but you it's like a different case you before err after you like um kind of macam give up playing drums you actually went into right
oh gitu ya I actually tried you know macam
um or like techno or err what what what genre do you mention earlier on tadi
ah okay okay despite I want to understand macam further err okay disc jockey when you say you mix one song to another song kan so which means you have two turntables correct
so what you are trying to achieve is kira macam kau nak make
err like err a track from scratch betul tak
okay so okay in in in bands punya kind of a point of view band eh it's like you want to have your own band instead of play you're having a band with err kira main cover ah gitu
betul tak ah
which is a bit ya leceh ah kan macam might as well we play err kita punya own originals so that is what you want to achieve in
ni lounge eh
eh kira macam during that time bila bila kau do all that kan macam
best tak
oh that explains kira guitar tu is mostly um bila kau dah like into dirty blues and stuff like that lah
so kalau tak kesah ah kalau it's not practical
okay like maybe first would be I want the bank account that will like refresh itself tau tak dia tak err like I don't need to put duit inside lah biar dia biar pakai jer refresh to the original amount so kalau macam gitu err I don't need like a lot of money I just have enough money but enough is good jadi like tak sombong gitu ah
top up ah top up tapi bukan kita yang top up ah
uh tak tahu siapa yang top up ah tapi terima kasih jer
nak kahwin oh tapi that's your first wish tu mesti mesti ada boyfriend dulu ah
terus suami eh takde boyfriend tapi now you got boyfriend right
tapi korang ada pernah macam uh fight ke apa ke
so far belum ah mm okay tapi sekarang kan
sekarang kan macam COVID kan so cannot really meet each other that much apa
oh but how frequently tu
but like for me I remember bila I was dating kan uh we meet everyday sebab sama sekolah apa so kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama in the weekends so hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka so bila kahwin I also know that takkan jelak ah
tak serik ah tapi okay ah dah dah come on ah dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu should be fine lah kan
eh panggil dia apa makcik cik
apa-apa jer jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia
oh tapi dah it's like coincidence ke atau memang nak jumpa dia
bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau like atau tak kasi dia jumpa you
oh ya ya ya oh dia tak tahu
mak dia jer tahu ah
oh asal dia tak bilang
ya macam why he why he like want to like keep it secret seh
okay so do you guys like macam
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then kalau like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know ah middle chair honestly I don't know
problem with that so far takde lah
bagus lah K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
oh eh apa bara api tu scary juga tu nanti kalau like if one of you all like marah habis sia dua-dua volcano seh
so like your chinese one your you you're what ah tiger right ya tiger memang ah
macam a'ah bara api gitu tiger fierce
tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa so baru tiga bulan so you don't know lah like
cause for me and my husband kalau kita kita dah jumpa everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months kita macam dah tahu each other gitu ah so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
fight that okay I did something wrong then kita orang cakap ah kita mesti cakap ah like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys dia sekarang sekolah right so he berapa tahun lagi eh
oh he's just a normal lah bukan honours lah
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years gitu
mm four years so dia macam
okay dia start dia belajar apa
gitu-gitu ah
oh first year already tak surviving oh rabak hancur seh
exam exam ah okay so dia sekarang end of the first year
if he pergi counselling the course counselling he might have to restart lah
three four more years with something you don't like kan lagi exams means you have to study for it
tu ah and he's still so young he's like what twenty five kan so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter ah ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then lagi rabak then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
I think macam dia kena fikir betul-betul lah kalau dia kalau dia nak continue ke atau dia nak
like tukar ke because like one year is still okay tapi bila dah two years gitu kan then I think that's when it's err there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay lah kalau nak tukar right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like kalau in in so actually kalau some people right they will uh come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first sebab lagi senang but you waste one year lah but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
uh uh so like macam gitu pun boleh lah kalau if you want because a lot of people kat poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like err some course that they don't like like engineering gitu then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma yang dorang nak and then after dorang masuk then they get to go ah so it for them is like um ya you you sacrifice one year ah to do what you want then so you can think of it like that gitu
okay so dia dah tapi dia electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff asal dia tak pergi digipen
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then kalau tak boleh you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best lah
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for ada tau art design on media that one at least ah there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
ya so like macam my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that one that time [kan] she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want lah so eh I mean I feel like
um I'm okay tapi I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so macam I felt like I needed to work or at least do something ah like not school for once gitu
ya pretty much even though like kat uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff tapi then I went back so ya then I think
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right um what I heard from my classmates ah yang dah dorang bekerja kan then dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun ah at the most sepuluh tahun gitu then dorang come back to like get just get a degree dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis like an essay like how to write essay all that dorang dah lupa
ya so um that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it gitu
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words apa
berapa tahun eh berapa tahun
oh satu eh
so kalau you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
lepas kahwin betul-betul nak kahwin dulu eh
oh is there a reason why you want to like kahwin first
um in terms of stress kan lepas kahwin eh you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I kahwin and then lepas tu like I felt very
um stressed out sebab like nak our our mum she ah she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and ayah decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking gitu so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
tapi takde apa-apa ah because ah kalau orang tanya pun I will just say oh my husband he's okay with apa so in the end religiously uh culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think ah so
kau siapa seh
so my suami is super like easy going dia faham everything I'm very honest to him
kalau I'm going to this place ke apa I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him lah I'm going to overnight kat tempat ni with my friends we just wanna chill kalau nak ikut ikut ah like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so kalau dia nak keluar ke apa with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding lah so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
kahwin ya
ya betul lah
tu ah
then macam I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
malangnya I think you want like my kind of wedding
ulam seh kampung kat mana ni kampung apa malaysia
pulau ubin dorang nak tutup apa
semakau pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi
kalau nak pergi kat malaysia kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana
ah tak rapat ah tapi ada lah ada tu ada lah
filter kau block yourself you block yourself you know
kau block sendiri but then the rental will be insane
ah betul lah uh then mm pulau ubin is actually quite interesting for a wedding
like like are they chinese ke malay ke oh
takde motor takde kereta ah bagus kau
dia jemput jer semua orang tapi actually tak jemput semua orang indirectly lah
orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat west kat east east so dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang uh yang uh um uh kat tuas situ kat johor masuk masuk ah johor masuk tapi kalau kau orang uh tampines pasir ris tak payah datang sudah waste your time
so dorang kat sana kat mana dorang the majlis kat mana
is like you only go there kalau nak show off
kan like if you just want to show off cakap like you like you got a lot of money then okay lah sentosa lah but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore yang you can actually get
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money gitu
uh tapi ada timer ah dah reach dah reach harbourfront okay habis wedding habis
uh uh uh unless if unless if like you ah ambil the cruise ship yang pergi batam and back ah then okay got time tapi ada cruise yang sekarang they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back lah so kalau macam gitu susah sikit ah
and orang tak boleh datang like wherever they want they have to come bila bila cruise dia dah nak ship off gitu ah
a'ah ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil lah sampan kau bawa sampan kau kelakar seh nanti dorang dayung sampan
alamak susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah
I think at night lah we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then bila dah malam kan then we say oh uh all the makcik pergi tidur and stuff and then terus we got to the club and then terus
so you went with adik
buffet jer buffet lah buffet dia halal lah
oh chilli crab pun ada
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones yang macam the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go ah even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like um
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like eh is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so rabak so I didn't even K I didn't even like
uh uh but okay lah it was fun lah it was for once you get to feel like macam orang kaya gitu uh tapi like ya that's it lah but I don't know lah like
kalau korang nak um pergi staycation ke tak
I know the kalau if the d'kranji here is
clean certified clean certified then maybe kita boleh pergi sana
cause there is like very secluded kan so it's a different experience gitu like out of city life
uh tapi I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
uh you and me will have this share the room and then he and abang hafiz will share lah
uh so kita halalkan lah
oh so susah tu but no if they like
uh uh a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause kalau if it's two hafizes I mean both tak boleh seh
uh uh so I think macam okay lah like we we can do that but it depends ah like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away tu ah
mm january gitu okay
ya lah but I mean okay lah we can we can always go tapi the thing is like you said ah must plan lah ya
oh ya the one you told me yang dia
I mean dorang pun macam orang melayu lah you have to understand lah kita orang pun macam everything also macam relax apa
tak ikut sangat ah but
ya so I feel like macam
macam gitu it will be really susah for them to
and indonesia pun teruk teruk seh
like indonesia is teruk
kalau tengok dia punya cases
ah betul
indonesia is also like quite high death rate kan death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else gitu
so this is very scary ah like lagi dorang pun I don't think they care then they are so dense gitu the the country
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures kan err then err but for them dorang tak ada pun I mean kita bila we needed the extra space terus kita pergi tukar expo lah tukar all the places that we already have tapi tak pakai apa because COVID kan so we use that place to um immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
tapi kalau indonesia I think susah because kan singapore kan kita kan asyik kiasu kan kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau indonesia semua relax
dorang relax jer kita kan kiasu everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
mm uh dorang pun macam kalau mati mati lah dah sakit that's their thinking ah dah sakit apa sakit so kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi
so dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu ah dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh uh manage kan all these things ah so it's very hard for them ah like india also is very very very bad
ya ya ya yang teruknya kan a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour ah saying that it's
a'ah but like I feel like it's somewhat true because dorang really tak kesah for the for the old people
ah then like dorang macam they will only like take in like patients yang have a chance of survival
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like dulu punya america
ya during um last time when america was quite bad kan I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so macam kesian ah but in india it's like that every day now
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more tapi they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang uh yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan like
don't mess lah don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that tu kan
ya tapi orang-orang tua dorang kan uh tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal lah kan kita orang dah cakap pakai mask and jangan uh jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang kan kalau nak keluar keluar lah apa nak jadi
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so macam um there was this atuk not atuk ah pek in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like oh no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
like we will just like huh like what what are we supposed to do you know ah but like kita tak boleh buat apa-apa cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
orang tak suka pakai mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
ah pek together kadang-kadang more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk macam biasa lah macam tak ada COVID gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang just biarkan jer ah
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do lah dia dah dia dah like bored lah I think
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there dorang tak tengok pun tau kalau kalau kau scan ke kau tak scan ke dorang just masuk dia kasi masuk jer dorang tak kesah kan ya so it's like it's so like uh jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay lah singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not ah I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
um but because everyone has to wear mask so tak tak boleh buat apa-apa so it's that's why tak ada macam transmission not so much of transmission ah ya
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that kan so err it's it's like already in our we already know you know like um the social way to like macam social responsibility lah ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause dah berapa lama seh dah berapa bulan going to one year I feel
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here sebab kan kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain is like wow betul-betul rabak like but kat singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker punya time that time bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus seh ya
with soap like dulu kan siapa nak cuci tangan dengan soap I ask you like tak ada seh all the aunty ah wash hand only wash water can already lah dorang memang mesti tak pakai soap punya mana ada pakai soap seh
now now they don't now they're like ah ya kalau tak wash nanti eh you never wash you never like use the soap ah then lepas tu baru dorang
you you really pakai the soap ya
good things comes of it uh come out from it lah ya ya ya betul lah like I think it's um inevitable lah like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
so the toilets are generally cleaner ah so like okay ah it's not bad ah um mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown kan and know france kan dah second lockdown
ya rather than macam kat sweden where it's like free and easy and then wow the death rates are like crazy seh
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad kat japan lah so dorang kena mula balik ah everything lah have to go back the mask and all that err I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff lah ya I think everywhere is still quite bad eh but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden kan kesian seh
tapi for me I kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat seoul garden sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu ah tu ah macam kesian seh ah nasib baik dia pergi doctor
ah naisb baik dia pergi doctor then lepas tu you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya ah tu ah so
I mean I think kesian ah macam he got more hate than
what he should have gotten gitu ya
no dorang three tables uh
so there were still like macam bergroup tapi err it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around lah macam kadang-kadang dorang mix like you sit here I sit there ke apa mix food err so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the um the fear that they have lah
ya so kesian ah
and dia dia sakit kan dia pergi doctor then bila dah kena COVID and the check up oh at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed lah the rules and stuff kat sini seoul garden ah if me I think I wouldn't say so much seh I diam diam jer tak lah but like I feel like macam why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already kan ya so I feel like um he's actually good part ah for him to be really responsible also
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended err people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like apa seh
like what the hell does that even mean gitu uh uh so I I was like wow this prime minister really wants to like err reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
uh uh I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you makan then I'm like but it's so like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so err ya macam gitu like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it ah bagus ah dorang habis ah a'ah tu ah like macam it's
ya ya ya he's just like ah give up lah dah mengaku kalah
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to macam err cheer up the community gitu um it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time lah
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic permulaan
okay I don't know what happen I was at home tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan as usual cari air then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the kranji resort ni macam cantik let's all go stay for holiday gitu ah satu three day two night something like that
no she just ask like korang nak pergi farm stay tak I initially said no because it's at kranji and I always told her like nanti sana ada momok
I think so ya dia dekat dengan sungei buloh all the way sia I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday um I went to research more lah like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown abeh macam tak ada makanan and stuff like that ah
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue nya barang barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november kan the review was on sixteen november just two days before
huh sekarang hotel tengah macam staycation package gitu kan
baru keluar eh ah later I go check
I ask mama what about snow city because it's the nearest to our house and we have never been there before so might as well pergi sana mama kata tak pernah nampak snow that time she went to bugger she just saw like one to three ah sikit gitu jer
yes it was a son of a peach then lepas tu I share with mama then mama was like eh tu dekat dengan apa rumahnya mak punya rumah kan tu is it the new house is it
tu mama dah start dia punya
oh yang block one two eight eh
boleh lah dah terlanjur
wow was this like during the time of the makcik keropok yang datang rumah abeh orang semua macam
oh no makcik keropok was much later I think was in that time
makcik keropok has been going around for quite long ah I don't know when we moved to our house dekat clementi kan think I was in uni that time then there was this bibik indonesian who tengah jual keropok and then it was I think malam lah macam lapan lepas maghrib bibik tu ketuk pintu abeh tanya nak jual keropok
then mama tengah kat living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like adik adik then the bibik kasihan tau the bibik was like saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu
then I was like I alamak mak aku tak baik seh dia terus panic gabrah depan depan bibik tu but I ended up buying a few keropok lah cause kasihan
ee bacin
lepas renovation hopefully dah okay lah tapi nak kena hack balik ah takut pijat-pijat bau takpe bau will go away but it's the pijat that maybe can come back
kat dalam-dalam ah
like really people who really don't know how to take care of their things actually like time beli rumah time tengok-tengok rumah your parents didn't know they have twenty cats inside the room
mm agaknya eh
tengah renovation ke
alamak okay lah tak lah nanti kalau kita bebual nanti tak dengar sangat
I tried linkedin I tried um my careers future which is tak bagus tak guna punya
or like macam singtel you know government related jobs ya and then um the the the macam amount of jobs kat situ tak banyak sangat lah kat my career future so I tried also the other one which is job street lah job street has the most but job street is mostly recruit recruiters ah or even if they have job like macam they call me back dia punya job dekat east side dekat loyang because I do supply chain mah so a bit too far for me lah
tak ada the good thing is like macam I attended all these itu job fairs and all these job fairs err there will be someone who will call me back and ask me if um anything positive come out of the the the job fair macam ada interview ke tak then I will just let them know that ada ke tak which I will always say none I attended follow back with me follow up with me on any interviews or what then they said okay never mind will still continue to search for you
eh tak tahu I will try
okay lah sekarang job market macam gitu so I'm just waiting for twenty twenty one ah for things to be better
itu jer so sad
oh so now he's only the only one stuck there but his family dah balik sini lah
sana tak ada macam like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the changi punya restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
when the news came out she ask me adik do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama nak try makan first class tak pernah duduk alah tak boleh fly kan duduk kat dalam aeroplane dapat makan pun jadi lah gitu so I told mama for the price that you pay ah I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
I remember like I I did say that out um mama did say that she want me to macam take them go jalan-jalan lain kali daya bawa pula lah because like the last time she went japan macam korang bawa dia kan so she said to me lain kali daya bawa lah kita jalan-jalan so I told mama
cara I jalan-jalan later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
but penat seh masa tu kita pergi japan banyak jalan so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
sedap but the sedap is what the cook is malaysian cook ah or japanese cook
I never try nasi lemak on airplane before
things to note nak kena try nasi lemak kat silk air important question nak fly tu bila tu aiya I hope they can find a cure for this COVID seh
betul punya travel bubble eh from one island to another island
oh ya a'ah orang semua nak balik negeri
dah relax dah kan
oh dah thirty minutes already
a'ah still a lot of things juga
eh then they hack it out then outside is what kosong jer oh
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually macam reject reject punya kalau orang tak suka the areas ah the units ah
ah atas tong sampah gitu ah ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya fengshui tak bagus ke yang at least the good thing is tak ada momok ah kalau resale kan
yang tengah yang tengah have lah tengah have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also macam cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app tu kan so people who live in like edgefield plains kat kawasan sengkang they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya ah macam kau masuk terus dah siap
I want like macam cement floor macam gini kan macam cement floor
it look like macam cement gitu like concrete gitu
so I was thinking of something like this lah macam yang penting colour grey bawah tu look a bit like cement
korang ada skirting tak kita letak skirting juga lah
because I was thinking that kalau if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm nanti bawa pluto sekali lah so I also think about oh if you want to have a house nanti pluto need her own cat tree lah you need to catify the house semua kan
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation abeh rumah dia macam minimalist gitu and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like macam have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
ye lah si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau jer now the kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek so that's why I'm thinking like that ah tak payah lah beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu simple simple then IKEA kan macam batau furniture then after five years can throw already
they katuk very fast eh
a lot of macam renovation company mcam dorang katuk very fast
oi kejapnya dah rosak
hood jatuh
oh ah reno talk bagus ya ya
I was actually looking at counter tops semalam cause I had berangan nak okay nak macam kayu punya butcher countertop pastu kan cement floor gini kan and then dia punya ah tempat cabinet dia colour putih gitu so I was thinking oh very nice colour putih macam a bit rustic sikit butcher block then sekali when I read about the butcher block is literally just a chopping board so nak kena letak mineral oil semua nak kena maintain tu yang leceh
oh macam boleh buat back splash terus gitu eh
wow tak pernah dengar ni vulcan
nak kena wax tak atau sealing ke apa
entah she tak mention apa she just said that ah nanti kalau singgah sheng siong bilang eh
betul but I'm not going to go sheng siong I'm going to go daiso but I don't know I think jcube got one daiso
padahal dekat but still uh need to walk further
choa chu kang nya dah siap
COVID happened kau nak kena bagi chance dekat dorang
but it's near to mama and papa so when I'm malas to cook I can just walk over
ah mama actually said that she say kau jangan pergi dekat tu sengkang jauh-jauh ni kau dekat-dekat jer dari lah dekat clementi resale pun tak apa
buruk-buruk one
ah then dah buat ni semua aiya tak payah pindah
ya lah tak payah pindah stay there for what at most also you just need to renovate the room that taufik has been using to keep his things did you see the canvas I saw a lot of like shoes they use the small rooms they change it to like a home office with like a see through glass it's very nice
true lah singapore susah nak cari yang perfect perfect
a'ah seh kasihan your neighbour only got one plant and then korang letak banyak-banyak
pokok hang dia satu jer tanam lah pokok-pokok hang banyak sikit
actually good lah the jiran that's okay tu pun susah nak dapat
oh dorang alternate kan
try teaching ah macam mana nak teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
oh okay okay okay faham faham
that's why I really macam tabik ah those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan parent layankan principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar
yang kat luar tu semua habis ah pecah-pecah
eh bijak eh dia bijak
tu lah kalau anak saudara sendiri okay tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds kalau anak saudara at least the values are still similar you know kalau budak tu ada problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
dah hafal script ah gitu
for me tuition was different okay like macam I know that the syllabus are ajar macam gini kan but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different macam not say education level like macam tahap kefahaman dorang is different so macam maybe in class the teacher already dah start on algebra but the kids punya foundation is still very weak so although dorang dah sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still macam at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting lah for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching ah ada budak macam they really need ah physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think macam is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all kan
they will be like apa tu one kenapa one kenapa one plus one kenapa tak boleh one and that kind of thing
actually it's not that hard I realise okay lah because for me um I teach budget tuition and I teach orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam more or less macam ah relax jer kau datang class kan dia kasi epok-epok lah dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
tu dorang punya um general generally lah most of them dorang punya mindset is like that there are a few macam one or two who come and they say like oh I want my kids to get A padahal the kid is already a B student so for me macam when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid dah interested in learning automatic terus dorang A sendiri so jadi tak stress macam gitu
yang stress is when you haven't start the parent macam ah kepoh kepoh lah like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid ah macam gitu tu leceh sikit
ajar budak-budak madrasah ah madrasah kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school punya how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some makcik like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because madrasah under private school kan
okay what al al-irsyad ah eh but al-irsyad susah nak masuk eh
sekolah tahfiz ah
eh but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from madrasah like oh my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
okay mah tak salah pe but I notice this trend tau macam my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education wah they really start planning the education route early on baby masih dalam perut dah planning tau nak hantar childcare ni lepas umur ni pergi this school nanti pastu hantar ni
macam we all orang biasa relax ah pergi sekolah good enough already ah
as an adult I wanted to be a farmer I apply kat kok fah kena reject seh sedih
it's not tak kuat sangat ah but
ya but only to cari like shows
sub Reddits I've been I've been rewatching this show vikings you tengok ke
ah cause dulu I watched it like
I watched like the first three seasons like religiously habis
ya ya ya that's why he tembak like the canon ball semua kan habis the benda macam
apa lalu jadi macam pirate ah basically so like our
orang bugis right pirates
what the hell is piawai
what the hell is piawaian
what does kepiawaian mean in indonesian
huzaifi you you read a melayu
primary school melayu textbook you probably need it to be translated for you also
orh kepiawaian means expertise or skill
err mahathir like the malaysian punya prime minister kan
he referred to the bugis people as pirates and then after that like the malaysian royals marah dengan dia
it's like eh kau jangan main main aku aku darah what is pirate in melayu ah
oh kau jangan main main aku ada darah lanun
ya dulu lah I think
I dulu bila I time
mula right
I like pernah dengar orang kata orang bugis pirate then I like
kena letak at my at my thigh
pantai you macam orang pandai ada orang jaga
ada letak at my thigh sia I already had it planned like the placement semua habis
and then after that I fikir balik
cool pe tak cool ke
eh no sia I fikir for like
I fikir for like tiga tahun sia
and after that I finally masuk then I was like okay
already like I think tiga tahun in I saved up enough money then I was like ah I I cannot lah later I go later they throw me into like mono intake infantry or something cause I got tattoo so I wait first
then masuk then I like cannot do ah later must take
is that is that correct memang ah
you're so cool bro chey memang lah
K jadi tattoo apa yang
koi fish eh koi fish tak habis eh
nanti kat atas it's a dragon tapi usually dia orang tak ada duit nak habiskan the dragon so it's just a koi fish at the forearm
I kena like tiga orang who have the exact same tattoo and they stop at the exact same spot
tak ada colour ah
colour mahal sia
apa sia
eh korang boleh maki tak
number one sakit eh later you like you tattoo yourself after that you pengsan macam mana
then just like later pengsan then the line like drag across across your body
you know like when you're writing ya but you're like in class then later tertidur youppo
apa berkam apa sia
macam tattoo
it's like test test dulu ah
cause the gun is going in and out it's very fast so you tak rasa sangat
or like you rasa for a shorter amount of time cause it's masuk keluar masuk keluar
well with the hand one it's like the person cucuk one by one slowly I'm sure it's gonna hurt more
you tau ah I lagi sikit I bila I went to mexico kan
I lagi sikit
ya ah I already cari the kedai already I asked one of my friends there when I sampai like which one like which kedai this kedai bagus or not then he said oh ya ya this one dia ada kawan pergi something like that and then after that
baru nak book appointment already when I was there
habis my dad dia kata oh cause before that my dad got the kidney problems one then he didn't want to let me or my sisters donate our kidney
my dad dia ada kidney problems
ya so at that point of time dia tak bagi kita orang donate our kidney
I I I don't need to take care of my body what cause I got nothing to lose so I baru nak eh I baru nak err book appointment habis
the night bila I was about to book the appointment my dad messaged his kidney were like lebih teruk then after that he said like then I told him lah if you want the kidney I can give then he said okay can
habis bila balik I bilang kakak then I was like oh I I I almost got it then after that she marah ah mampus sia no ah
call me bodoh all then I was like correct ah bodoh but
her friend is like her age semua dah tua
ya they know lah like I balik pukul berapa
another time at the pukul empat pagi dia jumpa aku tengah muntah dalam toilet
cause she said dia kata pe ah
if your sister finds out she'll kill me so neither of us are gonna tell your sister cause I tengah muntah muntah dalam toilet dia muntah rabak
err unless kakak telah bayar then yeah
I don't know ah I I don't minum anymore not since I met amira
she call me kentang
wait then like she asked me ah macam dulu I buat apa then I told her like all those benda bodoh bodoh like like you know like people
like conventionally when people go clubbing and stuff right like they like fuck boys ah like later they cari perempuan or what
bila I pergi clubbing in with all my friends
all I did was just make a nuisance of myself like joget joget I panjat pokok
ya I panjat dua pokok satu lamp post
when I balik station
cause that that time was like a rohtak outing the entire rohtak you know because no then after that the next day shift I balik station
then I masuk the office jer then after that everybody was calling me eh peter parker peter parker then I was like huh apa sia
and then after that my friend told me like oh kau tak mabuk kau panjat pokok habis after that like the this lah she was the one yang like jaga me because she don't drink then they know like I'm a handful
so like she turned around like she couldn't find me then she turned around then she saw me climbing the pokok then she's like ah turun then I was like no go away I'm peter parker and after that I started climbing higher
ya then nasib baik sia but it's
so ya like I I satan satan tapi bodoh
not not like the not like the creepy satan but the bodoh satan
aku nak aku nak pergi nak pergi jumpa kawan kawan eh like then after that kita tengah joget joget so usually when I go
like clubbing and K I'll go with my friends and then after that we just joget joget together like just guys it's just like playing around by ourselves then after that at one point of time there was this group of girls
also happened to be there and then after that they like trying to like like my friends all like ikut dia orang ah
I sendiri
and after that this girl came up to me then after that she like started macam joget depan I
and after that I pusing belakang then I was like eh bodoh sia lah sempit sia and then I the girl then I they all were like what the fuck sia
kesian the girl tak buat salah sia kena
marah ya sia
hose testing tu apa like you just turn on the thing ah
oh dah buat salah sekarang buat baik pula
baik hati ah
merepek sia
what time you balik
ya okay lah that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like turun
tujuh setengah kan
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I malas so I tidur I tidur in like the they have like a mass hall but atas ah on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else tidur on the first floor and then I tidur on the second floor
habis naik atas like pukul satu pagi then I was like eh ma'am I I go sleep first ah then she like oh K K I see you upstairs
bangun pukul sembilan pagi sia
when I when I went back into the office sia lah semua day crew and then they all like eh you this shift what why you come late then I was like no encik I night shift sia
ya pukul sembilan bangun
then after that nak kena sign out kan the reservist nya attendance sheet
night shift nya semua paramedics dah balik then I was like eh encik macam mana sia then he's like ah never mind I sign for you I sign for you
takkan nak begitu sia lah
balik on the dot sia
orh me and my friends selalu keluar eat breakfast lah so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics balik station ah
one time we naik basikal
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already pergi entah mana nak makan lah or something then my friend kata eh sia lah aku tertinggal aku ni barang ah
then after that we cycled back and then we masuk the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper macam
habis dia orang keluar then after that the suay suay the is like oi bicycle siapa ni then I was like encik encik bukan saya punya bicycle
eight bicycles like parked beside the siapa tak bingit sia
twenty percent a quarter of them ah dapat shock
no most of the time if dapat shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
so the pulse dah balik ah
no no when was the last time the patient like dia orang sampai dia dah dah gone kan so like how long before that did they last see him
orh like depan mata ah
kadang eh the
when I went back reservist the medic told me sekarang they make it compulsory sia
kena like you you have to have the my responder app
then after that sekarang dia orang enforce like you have to download
then after that if you dapat the notification kena pergi ah I mean if you tak nampak then bo pian lah but
apa lagi case err the community responder was
habis the this the this captain the the dia dulu macam medical officer
habis my my kawan nampak dia tengah belakang was like belakang selalu macam lepak lepak ah
then after that dia nampak the captain dia terus eh sia lah
my the the responder is captain ah then after that he told us macam
macam take charge of the scenes semua then I was like eh sia lah uar uar sia aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh jer macam tu
one of my last few duties ah like my err the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate sia resuscitate the patient dapat we gave like I think three or four shocks
but the nyonya was quite tua already
the dia orang dah tolong this nyonya out of the toilet then she terus collapse so like right from the mata ah then they immediately call
eh usually cardiac arrest kalau pagi pagi kan it's usually a macam orang baru bangun baru bangun then they jumpa the body then it's like dah beberap jam ah so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest
tak boleh save ah
and kena buat betul betul lah that time apa lagi
err my last duty in like my last duty ever kena dapat call the this ah pek he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we sampai and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court ah
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor datang so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor buat you know like got a there's a pace one when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
then doctor buat macam macam jackhammer sia don't know what
macam begitu then after that macam eh pukimak ini apa sia ini rabbit pe and then after that my paramedic my paramedic tengah jalan
then lepas tu he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
sia lah dia buat apa sia then I was like betul in public K buat betul betul
the doctor the doctor buat sembarang then we after that we all like what the fuck sia the doctor you know
that's why like tak tahu malu ke like
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew kan you will gaduh over who gets to do
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you kena letak the lah the set up the set apa
buat the adrenaline kasi the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you buat salah you kelam kabut you don't give it to the paramedic on time kena maki
so like everybody will gaduh over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I penat
I know my encik was the one who came up with the vehicles sia there like that was his project
I think ya tak salah I heard they got the thing for macam orang morbidly obese
cause the normal the normal alpha sekarang is fucking kecil sia like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
mm the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also boleh
the new alpha is freaking sempit sia like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite sempit already
plus the dengan the stretcher kan
like you don't need to angkat the stretcher like you just picik the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves bodoh tak nak taruh in ambulance when we actually convey patients ke mana yang sedia
rabak sia
wait the the guy also a medic ah tu
actually ah the my last cardiac arrest case like bila balik reservist ni we also turn out with and then after that I nampak kan
so far dia orang asyik suruh the boy yang buat then after that yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian sia
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like tak
like lepas tangan so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment ah like we put in the apa tubing semua
and then after that so like free up free our hands lah so the crew yang buat
and then after that like I tak pernah nampak anyone wearing orange bunker gear buat so far is selalu the firefighter
tak ah
what you all turn out pakai bunker gear pe
tak stress ah
oh then nasib baik sia nasib baik ada the fire fight
sekarang it's that's damn short sia so dulu dulu during my time kan the attachment was like two dua tiga tahun begitu
so like basically the whole and then semua turun then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is ah like I'm sure there's like some
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people buat the medical staff lah the semua
but then sejak COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
apa fire site
I get lah if you want to be ons but tapi ko nak kacau reservists buat apa sia
baru juga ah
double meaning tu apa sia
so it's basically covering the punya
oh so if turn out then you ikut if turn out also you ikut ah
oh rabak
rabak pe
penat ah
mana siap lah at least you dapat
last time tak ada kan your tak ada you get to face
a'ah mampus I I loh
then macam kawan pekik
the officer just bawa lah then he just continue
ya tak probably ah
but I already do two cycles tak pernah dapat sia the card terlupa
then tak pernah they never give
the no lah it's not like we go through the full benda lah cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
and then they have the mannequin habis kena buat lah then they measure
I think it's just paper work ah so they like when you balik reservist then they said like oh we all got the cert already so we can turn out for cardiac arrest
was you ajar I
you taught me the hiemlich kat rumah atuk
I remember you that time you you masih botak I think you still in that time then you got to
and you keluar apa buka and and then after that you you told me right eh you know what I learnt or not then you started doing the hiemlich on me ajar pe
I had I had one this one time in got this one nyonya she said like oh I I'm choking
and then after that we sampai sia lah this nyonya fucking waste our time sia then she like mati mati she said like oh I can feel it in my throat I can feel it in my throat then we asked her what you eat she's like oh
that one is a different bodoh like if you are if you are actually choking you cannot talk but you should be able to sign if the person is right in front of you you confirm can like sign say you choking what
but like if you can berbual and tell the operator on the phone that you are choking then after that the the ambulance sampai
then you can buka the pin you can walk to the door buka pintu then you like oh I I choking just now I ate this nut I can feel it in my throat
I turned to my paramedic that time I that time I tengah ah so like my perangai already like like half fuck ah
then after I turned to my paramedic then after that he like I I told you macam cakap buang masa sia then after that my paramedic's like eh lain kan lain kan
then after that she takut then I was like then what the fuck you want sia
bingit sia
ya but I orang
my paramedic penakut so he convey
ya orh it's more of like he malas want to
ya she mati mati want to go
that one I bingit
like my friends all they say like oh sia lah they they malas want to turn out for like rabak punya call
but like I'd rather go for rabak call then the call is just waste my time
I mean macam ini kes bodoh bodoh sia then it's just like naik marah sia
got one time apa lagi this budak dia dia dia call ambulance dia kata like oh I I I tried to kill myself so we gotta rush down lah we thought like apa jadi
cepat cepat ah pergi
then we sampai already then we ask him what what what did you inject you tell us specifically so we like dia orang cari macam bleach bottle ke apa on the floor then he said oh I swallow this uh I swallow coins
the budak the budak call
or whatever then after that he complained complained complained then I was like no no no why you swallow the coins like you you want to kill yourself I understand why the coin then he like I don't know what to do then after that my paramedic marah me he's like eh abang kau tak boleh main main then I was like it's a legit question though what the fuck
ya after that my paramedic like he my my paramedic don't let me talk to the patient already he like kau duduk kat tepi kau main main
that one pecah nyawa nyawa on another level and that wasn't me there wasn't me that wasn't me I that one I tak berani the the kind of thing I don't play

err semalam uh I spend like almost for the whole day at err I was studying for my studying for my exam for my finance exam so most of the time err kat kat lah belajar jer sampai from pukul satu sampai pukul enam gitu
ya I just study makan uh belajar makan belajar makan belajar makan ya uh
err uh actually I bought food from bukit batok bukit batok I didn't buy anything from cause macam nak macam nak save duit eh nak save duit kan so err I bought from a like a bukit batok store a store from bukit batok yang jual yang kat bawah that kind
ya so the food there macam nasi lemak nasi ayam is like uh macam murah-murah kat sana it's like dua setengah like one satu satu satu setengah gitu so macam very murah then harga dia harga dia murah so err kalau tak sedap tak apa lah ya so that's what I had for my lunch yesterday
mm kat mana it's like bukit the bukit batok one
dekat kan
apa err is it nice
err maybe macam dah lama tak makan burger king
I went out for dinner with someone so kita err we went to try out this cafe at jurong east um the new cafe ah so yesterday dia punya uh it was its opening day um I forget what is the cafe called lah ya but it's near err area that that that jurong east area ya so uh when the food macam uh it's boleh tahan lah macam
um not the best not the best decent decent food ah so I tried err fish and chips err I tried fish and chips and err order also mushroom soup ah so the fish and chips macam apa tu uh boleh tahan lah macam lebih baik kalau it's apa tu lebih garing eh lebih garing ah and dia punya apa tu dia punya dia punya flavour eh
err is not my taste lah not my taste ya then their their mushroom soup is fine err macam terlalu salty for me ya
no the taste macam masin ah masin salty ah so I had err this tea called strawberry mango tea which is err interesting it taste it's just not bad lah it smells not bad the tea is like any other tea but the smell is good
err just to try out new stuff lor like he's a foodie so macam uh just go go around try new halal food see if it's nice in singapore there is not much halal options right so you just want to see see macam just take a look see see eat eat a bit here and there
we shared the food because err the err he he ate in the morning like before he came out so macam he's trying to I think he's trying to like do a bit of weight loss also lah cause he quite big size ya
twenty four hours so there's also a drive through kan ya so we we just it's a drive through ya so we just uh we went there for awhile just to macam have a bit of dessert lah macam so we we ordered like err two mocha iced mocha latte
ya I suka
ya so it was it was not bad lah macam it's uh is a bit uh ex apa tu a bit mahal and a bit uh sweet ya sweet tapi just sit down there macam just to berbual-bual jer lah berbual-bual talk about stuff
kat mana like how much
oh I think it's the mi Maggi one right mi Maggi noodles
tak nampak benda-benda halus eh
a'ah seh now now like uh sekarang tengah hujan right uh it's hujan semenjak pukul lima empat setengah gitu ah kan ya tapi macam dah it has it looks like the rain has subsided a bit so I think there might be a chance that we can play badminton at six
actually the weather now is like the best cause like macam it's mendung it's cooling
ya mendung err a bit sejuk and it's just nice weather ah
ya it will be hard to play badminton when it's too windy lah ya and if it's too slippery because right now the tennis court is a bit err it's like it looks very wet basah cause of the hujan
which is what you want teleport
so the is like a sci-fi movie where err the story is about this err boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so err it happened err sebab one day dia macam apa tu he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so dia punya classmates I mean when the group macam ada
gangster gangster sikit ah ya so like even though they are very young the err they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time uh macam dia tengah lari tengah lari from the orang kan abeh um one of them from the bad guy actually tembak
tembak the the guy so he hit the side of his head ah ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone err in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid lah but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
err to actually um see whatever you're typing err whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related lah and he has the ability to macam technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like err if you think about it right macam there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool lah very cool
ya cuma macam now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others uh for others for his own good and to help others lah I mean macam so he helped to track down the the culprits ah so the story was err macam apa tu uh this uh the neighbourhood is macam ada apa eh
macam ada is run by this err drug drug society drug a group ah like err ya so he helped to track this group down abeh macam help the police to do so he he use his technology macam to draw them in lah to expose on the drugs and dark secrets dorang ada to the neighbourhood and to the police
orh no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts macam like err ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like err put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool lah ya
ya ke oh is it that's nice oh he more like he targets the the gangsters society but dia macam he let them uh like he drains all of their bank accounts so that dorang tak ada resources
orh err usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience err any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that macam
there's always like err well known stereotypes err within the malay community err for example macam one very good example would be macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai in math gitu ya from young so and usually like err because like orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat void deck gitu so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people lor in a sense ya
which I think err palsu lah because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it what it's the same for everyone cuma dulu is okay what to lepak cause like last time with your friends just chill chill lah like if if you like to me if your if your kind of lepak is main err like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of lepak is really like is at the void deck lah chit chat yang main guitar ya so is the same kind of lepak lah I mean is just different kind of how you view lepak as
even though I do agree that err there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but err to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to err macam public uni ah I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases macam after poly right they they err they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then macam if you look at err maritime studies kan err from poly err I think I got one friend yang macam he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship one
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose lah I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya macam gitu jer lah
lama eh it's very long
macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam eh
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools tapi when you talk about those non like err like we have certain schools in singapore yang macam the fees very expensive kan so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not err for those families yang macam tak boleh afford lah because the fees are very expensive even like um macam if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ah education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families yang macam or those like err families yang macam rumah tangga ada masalah uh mak bapa tak boleh beri uh tak boleh kasi apa tu uh apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada uh apa tu anak-anak mereka so I think this is where it will be nice lah if the err those families uh those kids um can
you do lah but some people just need err err a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like uh macam some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit uh of like resources a bit then they will start to see orh this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school lah so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards uh macam striving to to get a scholarship
but you have to eat other people for meals dahsyat seh
foodpanda dah takde agaknya asal nak

ha cerita dia kalau nak tahu pasal bunuh-bunuh dia ada nicole kidman tapi bagus ah dia dia thriller cerita dia ah okay lah cerita sikit eh nicole kidman ni dia sebenarnya psychiatrist suami dia doctor untuk cancer uh untuk budak-budak so kirakan dia orang dua ni kaya ah lepas tu anak dia orang sekolah atas high satu hari tu ada budak baru masuk sekolah pakai scholarship budak tu bangsa sepanyol
jadi mak dia jadi kawan dengan nicole pasal
anak nicole pun sekolah situ kira macam antara dua darjat ah yang sepanyol tu miskin si nicole ni kaya pendekkan cerita
perempuan sepanyol tu kena bunuh teka siapa dia punya suspect
suami si nicole padahal nicole seorang jer kawan dengan dia
pasal si suami nicole tu ada affair dengan si sepanyol ni
tak habis tengok jadi kita tengok sendiri series tu uh pasal tu potong-potong so tak tahu lah apa jadi takde nak kena tengok online ah dia main kat jer so nak kena stream ah
uh patut tadi keluar habis hujan lebat gila
mm besok mungkin uh nak pergi uh beli beras tengok ah macam mana makan kat luar ah
uh belum tahu tengok cuaca
uh dia pergi memancing oh tapi tak jadi tak tahu ah tadi dia pergi tadi dia dah siap-siap tau lepas tu dia dia keluar lepas tu kejap lagi dia masuk balik lepas tu dia cakap uh gerimis lepas tu dia taruh balik the barang-barang pancing dia lepas tu kejap lagi dia duduk kat kerusi so tak jadi lah tu sebab tu dia kat situ
dia hantar kat kedai omar tadi uh uh petang tengah hari
a'ah sebelum hujan
cuci carburetor jer
oh full service dah cakap dah dah tanya dia dia cakap boleh buat sendiri huh
ah tak pasti mungkin kot pasal abang ayie dah pass two A kan so dia nak bawa motor tu kan
uh ya by the way kan tadi kita berbual pasal dua belas dua belas uh actually you can also buy grab vouchers or cinema voucher in shopee tau it's a good deal macam you just pay five dollars but the cinema voucher is worth nine dollars
ah see how lah if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers ke or I will buy the cinema vouchers
so dia punya is testing so so maksudnya dia uh
oh okay okay so kalau kalau nak apply macam uh position apa yang most slightly akan take your cert take uh takes graduates
rovers okay then kalau uh uh how macam mana boleh pakai cert tu untuk apply kalau boleh jadi apa
uh dekat uh poly macam ni ah the the normal the five poly's one of them so uh bayar ah ke oh diploma
oh bagus eh tapi tapi dia join dia join under uh full time staff or contract staff
contract tapi dia tolong untuk further studies oh that's good ya I think most likely dia dah dapat diploma dia akan take dia akan take
oh okay okay then uh ada apa-apa lagi tak kerja yang macam
mm bagus lah tu
kalau ah
okay lah tengok ah macam mana rezeki nanti try lah
apa tengok apa ada opening apa lagi
the the uh turkey right ya yang tujuh setengah tu jangan lupa so nak beli apa untuk alesya
for spark ke X one R
oh actually okay very simple okay untuk motor-motor uh spark atau motor X one R ni
takkan sentuh satu benda pun selagi tak bayar owner dia duit
so akan just naik jer
dua-dua uh under ayah punya nama bukan nama kita kereta jer so um
dia punya plan kan is uh dia punya plan uh kalau
uh dah ada motor yang bagus
ataupun kalau takde tapi nak naik yang ini so akan uh beli lah buy over so bayar ayah let's say X one R X one R worth berapa sekarang
okay so maybe bayar dia dua ribu beli beli dari dia okay okay ni just misalnya lah so kalau betul-betul nak buat something eh uh uh nak pakai X one R tu jadi spare and nak nak repair hantar kat rumah kan so kita nak kena bayar dia jadi kita nak keluarkan nama dia so akan bayar dia just like token ah I takkan bayar full sum okay motor not good condition so maybe dua ribu lepas tu uh baru hantar kedai baru akan taruh duit
so sekarang tak bagus jangan kacau apa-apa because motor tu takde nama takde full ownership so macam tu lah cerita dia so sekarang bila naik kan dia dia punya motor dah start bising tapi dia kata dah adjust
chain tapi tak tahu ah kena try lagi
sebab dia sebab dia bising apa ah
tengok ah macam mana so tu lah plan dia kenapa ada siapa-siapa minat bawa X one R atau nak betulkan berapa banyak motor nak ada ya tapi faham kan that means kalau sesiapa nak lumba
tahu tapi faham kan because selagi benda tu kita punya kita tak boleh ubah
nanti dia akan jadi part dua so nak buat apa-apa pun nak kena beli over itu motor atau at least letak duit jadi tutup story tu nanti lah dulu tengok kasih kita fikir because ada chance uh uh I prefer uh lagi suka nak beli motor uh apa nama dia
uh lupa lah nama dia uh no no bukan kapcai uh yang macam uh azri nak bikin tu apa nama dia ya tapi uh no two B two B tu kirakan uh dia kirakan bukan W two hundred kirakan nak beli yang siap dia dah bikinkan ah mm so kalau uh tu kan banyak pakai duit kan so kalau nak beli nak nak pakai duit untuk motr gitu then
takkan nak buat nak spend tu duit untuk motor motor kapcai gini
so uh sampai kita dah beli motor idaman uh jangan fikir langsung nak buat apa-apa dengan X one R ni
ya tu plan dia lah tapi
it's this um objective dia sama selagi motor tu ada tuan dia jangan pandai-pandai godeh kau siapa yang nak jawab
ya lah so tu jer lah cara dia uh kalau betul-betul nak kena beli jer ah jadi uh takde orang akan bising
itu jer lah
mm so uh bagus tak idea kita
boring tapi kalau kita dah ubah suai nanti kalau ada apa-apa masalah siapa yang nak tanggungjawab
mm fikir tapi okay lah nanti bayar dia dulu lah tengok lah
uh apa cerita dengan abang yang dekat hougang tu dia nak bawa uh dia nak dia dia masih nak bawa delivery tak
ke tu saja jer dia cakap apa dia cakap apa
ya then when you tell him that what did he say it was was he serious or he was just uh just berbual kosong
then um kenapa uh sekarang baru nak buat ni pasal dia selalu ada uh apa free time apa dia tapi dia kat rumah main game kenapa dia tak pergi buat this delivery job
so sekarang dia dah relax ah baru ada time
kurang lah
dia nak buat delivery ah
eh dah bilang dia nak kena bayar uh bag dia semua dia cakap apa
okay tapi tak cakap apa-apa pun senyap jer so maybe berbual kosong ah
tengok ah macam mana
eh oh okay nanti dia datang rumah tengok ah dia ada cakap pasal ni ke tak
so dia nak beli motor apa yang kat bawah tu
mm a'ah tak faham pasal uh bukan ke uh start topic ni cakap pasal dia nak kerja delivery so kalau dia nak kerja delivery kenapa nak pinjam duit untuk beli motor scrambler macam motor dia bawa dia patut pinjam duit untuk beli motor biasa motor kapcai hmm
tapi uh okay so kirakan takde link ah dengan delivery sekarang ni pasal dia nak ada link juga
nak dua ah delivery and also untuk dia
tapi dah dah bilang dia lah kalau nak bawa delivery pakai uh scrambler susah
so boleh nampak kan yang macam tak make sense kan oh uh tahu tak bila dia mati eh
tahun depan so that's why ya
then dia cakap apa kenapa kenapa dia terkejut
then dia cakap then dia cakap apa
ya jangan main-main bilang dia kalau dia buat benda ni dia akan kena boleh kena buang eh
tahu tapi tahu tak tu boleh jadi dia jangan jadi viral
ya lah so so kerja apa shift but ah by the way dah boleh kerja roo tau
dah boleh start kalau nak dia bayar bagus tau tadi sebelas dollar sepuluh
oh macam surcharge gitu ah oh
ya but I didn't uh tapi tak tahu tau yang dia naikkan dia punya docket pasal hujan ingatkan pasal distance pasal distance dia pun jauh juga
berbaloi uh apa um apa lagi eh ni deliveroo ya so dah boleh naik dah boleh uh log in dah
then ah grab pun dah boleh
tapi grab is lima dollar kalau satu trip deliveroo uh equals to tiga no uh dua trip grab
ya ya tapi tak tahu tahu uh the distance uh pasal that time roo punya is jauh
tapi jauh bukan jauh gila ah jauh macam jauh paya lebar
a lot of things ya a lot of things changed lah I mean um I mean my habits and err routines banyak dah tukar ya so especially sekarang kena work from home so that sort of things that you have to adapt to yourself ya
so so nak tanya sikit so you rasa this COVID right have err actually changed you to be a better person ke you rasa macam COVID is such a you know is making your life difficult
ya the good thing now you boleh spend time dengan parents you kan like you know more more time to get home you know daripada keluar because there's not much to do outside and and you cannot kita tak boleh travel so there's a lot of restrictions going on ya
so sekarang you have a new skill lah you the pro lah kan when it comes to like designing
boleh buat poster lah ni you know like marketing advertising okay not bad uh that's interesting okay
yes ya last time I feel like err it's such a waste I'm repaying every month untuk for netflix then sekarang macam it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya or probably do some activities like err cycling you know ya probably I mean err tentative now the weather has you know ah you tahu lah kan weather dia sekarang nak hujan
hujan sekejap you know panas so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just err tentative plan
oh really dekat dekat town is it bali lane okay
I should I should try ah I should pergi and you know mesti mesti weekends long queue kan and there's a lot of um
jadi dia tak macam ya they block the seats lah okay
okay true tak tahu eh sekarang ada movie apa yang best I mean dah lama juga tak check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online jadi um for us to go physically to the cinema macam
cause you punya orang suka advance planning is it ya and also you kerja shift kan and also pasal your um off days
I I I also prefer um cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when um someone make plans in advance so macam teratur sikit your you know your week for the week so ya
kalau orang buat advance planning err
kalau orang buat advance planning and then err you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially kalau kita plan big um occasions or err you know like err birthday parties or anything then lepas tu cancel it will be very hard you know
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it err you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very marah you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest kenapa you tak just you know admit things that you you don't like
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like err because like maybe it's not a good thing kalau you terlalu upfront atau terlalu honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you simpan or kalau let's say you marah and then you you keep things to yourself then
uh but you you still not happy about it so you you know macam it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that um you know there's no macam terasa hati that kind of thing
ya lama kenal and then still keep in touch with err it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
instagram or social media ya because err most most of them are married with kids so macam they're busy dengan activity dia orang while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah so now the best way is to communicate through social media
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though um you know tak boleh jumpa and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact tanya khabar you know that's a very good thing
uh ya macam mana you tahu
um playing on my err playlist these few months ever since err COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music um suka um I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times kalau suka the same music then I'll just have the same
tengah hujan but I know that you are the opposite right you suka loud music kan you don't like macam cooling cooling
for someone who's introvert then suka loud music ya
instrumental as in ada orang nyanyi ke is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
ah tu itu kalau untuk tidur best eh
so I dengar by the way err you recently just start up a small business
kan uh macam yang
oh okay uh apa tu what's that
so macam mana you dapat the idea of um starting up that um small business of yours
so err berapa lama you dah you know venture into this small business
ya betul true
so um now that um you dah venture this err for the trial semua for three months so err what are some of the obstacles that err you actually face throughout macam err susah that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you punya explanation tadi kan I think this is such a good um way you know to to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you ada team lain macam
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right dia orang pun kerja
mm if you're if you are talking about business um ya there's a few things err on my mind yang I lama lah actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project err to help you know to actually um
kind of like support um like err you know small err other businesses that can help me to err create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me err to create err the leather sandals as per what I request yang I suka
err tapi at the same time err that this project is like the money will be going to err those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project yang I tengah tengok
but then sebab sekarang tengah pandemic so I um um venture out and actually look at the quality and all to um the stuff
err I need to be kat sana physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold dulu lah so I tak boleh I cannot err
through err communication through err whatsapp pun it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you pun touch the material the quality ya so all these macam err I don't know like pandemic has um kind of like err stop err a lot of um my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know kita boleh travel and
and you know err the economy pun kat other countries err affected kan like err because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support um you know when as we travel um like like for example malaysia kita semua pergi err to buy things ya all this now sekarang kita tak boleh we cannot go over
mahal ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice macam sometimes you nak look at look out for your stuff tapi dah habis ya people tend to stock up a lot
all this like macam kind of like err a bit difficult for us to travel around and um to look out for things that macam susah nak dapat you know nowadays cause everything um macam senang aje is very easy err to to sold out so you have to
err you know order online you know get it from other country purchase kat you know from other countries and err get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know um be stronger as err you know as a country as a as together
so anyway err okay let me ask you something okay kalau sekiranya
kalau sekiranya err um flight dah buka lah the the the the plane is you can start to buy tickets to go anywhere so the first thing you nak pergi where would you want to go in your mind what's in the first thing on your mind
really you nak pergi morocco
macam dah lama lah it it's on your mind that you want to
oh you dah pergi you have been to norway so you went
kalau macam new zealand ke you know that kind of place orang selalu buat road trip kan you know like new zealand australia that kind of place orang selalu might sewa like err rent a caravan kan or
or do some road trip and um do some macam camping camping punya style lah kan compared to it's not a city vibes punya kind of
so it kalau macam gini you cannot err bring your parents lah kan do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
ya and also like macam accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
um places to macam err to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe err the elderly might not err err feel that err comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I tak rasa they might you know they will like it because it's um something new tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan they have their own preference kan kalau you notice
because I've experienced before macam err even though my mum is um she likes to travel juga lah kan she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like macam food lah she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like macam maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or macam sambal you know err her own comfort food lah dia still akan prefer that compared to macam to venture out and try all the different kinds of err
food from the country that we are heading to so dia tak akan really macam kalau makan pun sikit aje
just a bit so dia tak akan macam into it
so kalau for me myself when I travel I would love to
ya correct that's why like they always pair err apa on standby they will bring err like sambal on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we err we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your err family or parents the the experience is different because maybe uh there's a lot of things that macam
might occur you know like um how the pace of how you want to travel the places you nak pergi you kena consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you nak pergi tapi kalau dengan friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so macam it it it's something um you know sometimes when I nak travel pun I will consider like should I bring my mum along or um okay lah tempat ni maybe I err just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not um
see the volcano err dekat indo something kan nak naik err the gunung but my mum say that oh tak boleh it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like hey that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions err precautions and such tapi my mum will still think that tak boleh you know
ya true ya ya semua tanggung dengan parents
okay um I just love snow okay I suka winter even though
good experience for me to err to finally dapat rasa you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and yang ke mana-mana yang ada snow
so bila I dapat experience snow tu I was like a bit jakun lah then I was like a bit like wow snow and then err at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad sampai negative the temperature was really bad ya but um
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that um you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore panas pun panas but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in sejuk dia macam one kind ya
but um still I I suka snow because of I can main I can play with the snow and then err and then the the the season like the vibes um
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry err so dia macam the feeling dia to christmas lagi-lagi macam so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
cause like winter kan that's when the only time you boleh pakai thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers yang all the seluar kat singapore you tak boleh you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
look different ya but then um ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets semua I tak tahu
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is err pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these um jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I jual ke you know
or should I buang you know ya
I would really err want to I really nak one thing that I really nak pergi after this err one place sorry err would be japan ya
I've been trying to err but then I heard a lot of things like macam mahal juga lah their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe bila pergi japan you pernah pergi kan
korea dengan japan ada ada beza tak what do you think
I think we singaporeans kena belajar eh from them basic manners
I just want to try the train kalau to get to experience dekat japan you know like where the they have bullet train ya bullet train ya
ya I I heard a lot about err pasal japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food err I mean um that japan has a lot of good food tapi macam when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit tokyo though like um ya macam tokyo is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you dah pernah pergi err japan kan
last time kita tak appreciate err buat travelling kan kita selalu err feel that okay anytime boleh pergi you know next time lah next year but then sekarang when it's really like macam stop us from travel
the feeling is like macam oh all these while especially kalau pasal gambar macam like let's say kita dah frequent pergi that country
ah tak payah lah ambil gambar ah tak payah pergi you know then all these memories macam oh no it's wasted macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar that kind of thing
anything that you nak tanya I
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like err small spider or semut sometimes I can be like you know
I I tak nak pegang I don't want to I don't want to kill it tak tak nak you know even though kita pakai tissue to throw it to angkat kan ya I'll be like tak nak you know just scared
cicak you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid lah because orang cakap like dah mati apa for example especially when it's dead kan then dah mati apa so like just just angkat lah but I still like no I got that fear and
because maybe because um kalau you naik plane then kan ada clouds like covering so you tak nampak tau bawah sangat
and you are in a macam covered closed like you're inside the plane what so tak you tak exposed sangat you know to look down tapi kalau let's say it's a
macam you nak kena jump from a high a high building or something err you have to look down kan so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
actually err when I was in hong-kong kan I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track err I was in hong-kong so err I naik this err cable car tau you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's err so you boleh nampak bawah your kaki can look through kat bawah so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared naik cable car biasa boleh apa but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to macam jatuh the feeling
so I guess ya even you naik luge kan you kan dia macam open luge as in the apa yang the skyride tu yang dekat sentosa
ah ya correct that one itu pun macam open apa ya your legs dangling so macam
that one also I won't dare to macam ambil ambil video ambil gambar cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing macam is kind of critical ah I feel tapi orang cakap it's quite silly lah but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared tapi orang lain probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
oh so where where did the spider tu apa lari then pergi somewhere like left or you had to kill it you kena bunuh
actually is is that the spider yang you tahu kaki dia like tipis ke ke dia
tapi kan ada kaki yang spider yang tipis ada yang very
I'm so glad like macam kalau singapore tak you you know tak macam sangat lah you know masuk spider but then if you are in kalau macam summer um season that's when the spiders um start to appear in in your house
so they start to masuk because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
kalau let's say for example I suruh you err go and pick up a cockroach yang dah mati you boleh lah just use your bare hands angkat macam gitu
just like that angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh you know just
ee antenna okay I mean you boleh angkat macam gitu with your bare hands oh no
speaking of insects kan so err what do you think about orang-orang yang err actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like err is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you boleh ke makan cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know macam it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know lah what where they found those kind of insect
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can macam at least the texture of the the dia punya shell macam edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
pork is part of their you know macam culture they like to eat ya
but I know I can see that you are an android user you pakai samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about um samsung
front camera ke atau yang back the back camera
dia punya music dia kan
ya ada yang baru punya you know the the flip phone is it err samsung ya I I saw that it looks kind of cool you know you can just
flip your phone and then like very compact you boleh letak dalam bag you what do you think of that
the middle part tu lah the screen punya macam
quite a lot for iphone you know and then bila they they start to have like ah tak ada charger err you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice kalau you tengok dia punya
bahagian at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old err ya the cable wire ya so it's like um
ya ya correct correct so you nak beli the head tu you kena beli a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know err I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you err so kalau nanti free you just
tu lah eh bila eh kita last jumpa each other
oh that time kita
oh apa ni yang
oh ya ya ya ya okay okay okay but that's not counted as jumpa lah because it was on google meet
and I think just because of this recording baru lah kita nak jumpa
kalau tak aku rasa next year baru aku jumpa kau
macam for me leceh seh you know like
for me lah for me like kau nak
like kau nak kena work from home then kau kena go back office might as well just work from home kan because your job pun doesn't really require you to like
you know it's like very easy what you just err turn on your laptop and then duduk depan screen jer
but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually lah my daily my daily apa err daily timetable will be like lapan setengah eight thirty then
kalau at most pun I will end about what five six kau imagine kau duduk in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya because for me kan aku macam
aku pun I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
eh kau tahu tak actually kan sekarang the thing that we are doing now right aku feel macam deja vu tau aku feel like
aku pernah mimpi pasal this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
aku feel like deja vu sia ni
I will make it through lah as always dah nak dekat final year kan
but you know like I feel like I've been err apa ni stress eating tau
I mean when you are stressed you I I keep I keep like macam apa um
brody um brody pula err body project
then macam
macam he the guy is very
macam very inspirational ah very motivational nanti dia macam dia kelakar like every time like dia dah habis dia punya whole exercise kan nanti last last kan bila apa ni cool down kan nanti dia kasih macam those motivational speech nanti isteri dia will be like apa jer apa jer budak ni buat cause like dia punya speech is good lah because dia akan cakap things like
err okay the fact that you have err chosen this err this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that err you know that macam you know he's trying to say that err macam well done lah because like kau err kau decides to do this workout
in a way macam well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause dia orang ada macam the the workout varies tau dia macam ada forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
after forty minutes kau feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring macam kau feel like okay ya that's why aku take this this this whole
it was like six years ago but only recently macam dia orang famous I think
kau try ah one day ya
because recently okay aku tried macam the videos from six years ago and the videos lah recently
yang six years six years ago is like purely macam because I think dia orang just started out right so macam dia orang very err
very macam mana nak cakap eh macam very rigid very cardio cardio you know macam dia orang punya videos macam really okay thirty second nanti ada countdown gitu sekarang dah macam more chillax macam dia orang ada letak lagu
it's good lah macam kau joget and then lagu dia macam
so kau don't feel like you are actually exercising
ya especially now that you are working from home kau nak kena really seh have to make time
because aku just recently started doing the cardio kan then there's this whole whole week yang aku tak err felt well so I didn't do workout aku dia punya apa
dia punya exhaustion tu dia punya level of exhaustion boleh rasa seh because it's like
you know kau feel so tired then kau feel like macam lemah
you know so that's why aku rasa like you you have to like um
actually aku have this intention tau like every morning bangun
pergi jogging
ya but actually you macam we must tau because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like um
our health ni is really very important because recently I just bought a kau tahu yang the blood pressure punya monitor cause my mum few days ago dia sakit kan yang dia pergi doctor tu so she had like macam high blood pressure lah
it was really very high so macam mm the doctor suruh pergi suruh beli that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
beli ah then the past few days we've been checking our
then err my adik punya was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty gitu macam normal lah then my adik cakap eh tak kak tak tak err it is normal for me hundred and fifty lepas tu aku macam are you sure your are you sure it's normal abeh dia cakap kak I'm fat then aku
ya so aku macam oh is it cause
for me kan aku aku don't really bother about this kind of thing tau to be honest
ya so aku macam recently aku macam fikir eh actually really seh I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then kau tengok lah muka aku ni macam this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so macam
very sucky like you know like macam kau
because you can you can really see from your your face tau kalau kau really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why aku these few days aku feel like err really seh I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
ya true that's why lah aku cakap aku aku aku feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since err start online learning ni
cause aku feel like
to be honest macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa those facial punya benda ah serious aku moisturizer aku really very very very consistent sekarang aku dah macam
ah lantak kau ah aku really malas tau then aku sekarang
aku could feel so
menyesal ah aku really menyesal
hey you sure kau step jer you are saying this because you are my friend

it's always like that macam kau bila kau in the same environment with the person kan kau tak kau tak macam close tau nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa kan nanti kau just randomly
pergi trip dengan dia lah pergi holiday dengan dia lah
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague dulu macam like when I was working with her
kita tak berbual langsung tau because
aku like macam kirakan assistant dia executive lah different roles kan because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder gitu so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
kita tak kita tak rapat then after I left then like tiba randomly kita because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then dia
dia macam random tiba-tiba dia ajak aku like pergi the one the one that I went perth with
and then the funny thing is like aku pergi trip dengan not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like kita tiga like considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth kita just clicked instantly tau
and then aku macam amazed because
it's just so macam orang cakap macam senang ah masuk
aku just be real dengan kau ah
kau tahu kan recently dia sakit
oh okay so it's really very way back ah okay okay so macam macam gini
dia sakit kan
it was err before he balik
okay so he sakit tekak and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like macam
err because he's okay not only his throat tau then he always has like macam ulcer
so we tried like natural remedies lah macam kasih dia minum like those um honey lemon kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu bonjela gel stuff like that
so he went back he went back home then err macam biasa kena quarantine and stuff like that then macam aku cakap dengan dia err you go jumpa doctor kat sana jumpa clinic kat sana cause first of all it's cheaper and and and kau at least like macam
err at least get to the bottom of it lah because if not you don't know what's happening kan because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working lepas tu dia pergi clinic kat sini pun
it's not working as well and then one thing aku geram pasal dia kan is that dia nak benda kan nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat like instantaneously tau
abeh aku macam eh come on lah like kau nak baik needs time to recover kan but dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik
where got such thing right so okay tu tak apa then he like err
but he balik
okay he balik then um he
he balik
and apa eh
he balik he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor cakap
err he has to go for like further check up dekat err specialists but it will take time
so right now he's actually on err renal diet ah renal diet ni macam um less salt less sodium less potassium kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku post dekat instagram yang gambar-gambar masak it was actually for him
I don't know eh macam sometimes recently aku feel like um
macam mana nak cakap eh okay you know I'm a very
err okay even though aku introvert kan you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when aku with him aku feel like aku
but emotionally because aku feel like
few months kan it's it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like aku trying
macam okay kau tahu aku sakit tangan
aku don't feel the support from him also
aku tak tahu ah macam recently aku feel like
apa eh nak cakap eh
dia cakap dengan aku ah he said um okay you know of my condition and stuff like that kan like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time aku was in err in a dilemma because
you know how um because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl yang macam
bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada you get what I mean
mesti ada ups and downs kan I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me macam do you still want to be with me despite my condition aku felt
guilty aku felt bersalah because macam oh because of his condition now abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia
okay aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun depressed ah maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
yang tadi aku jumpa tu I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I macam if I could turn back time sometimes I wish macam there are some exes yang aku shouldn't have let go
macam I should you know my yang the ex from err poly tu yang dia nyanyi tu
you know like macam I I want those kind of relationship yang macam
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently aku added him on err instagram and then like a few days ago ah no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message dia tau
but aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan message jangan cari pasal
like aku nak text but aku macam telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where aku felt like
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan the third party was my recent ex
so that's why aku like when I think about this whole thing kan aku feel like macam
I shouldn't have layan the ex man I mean I shouldn't have layan that third party
because you know you know that that time err during one of my um poly friend punya wedding kan we met
aku lupa tau aku honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then aku introduce macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I apa tu
cause dulu aku dengan dia okay lah a bit cheesy lah we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and aku I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know macam coupons that was my birthday like gift lah to him macam coupons macam
okay um redeem this to get a free dinner ah macam redeem this to get a free massage ah macam gitu you know
there's this book that I wrote tau aku dengan dia tulis err tak kita macam okay kau tahu macam paper kan lepas tu kita macam gunting then kita macam staple lah tepi tu macam make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you err what do you want to change in this relationship then macam appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then um apa ni err
I oh he wrote down that person name so like recently kan aku look through kan then aku realise oh my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then aku was like oh my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay lah because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you kan
I mean my ex yang best friend tu
err he was looking at me and then from dia macam dia tengok kan abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam
I don't know because okay lah recently okay aku be honest with dengan kau eh
ya online through err because kita friends again what on instagram
I tried to like macam talk to him and stuff like that but
err a conversation into me lah macam with me so macam dia
macam kita berbual then after that nanti kadang-kadang dia just seen tak reply gitu so macam so aku macam okay lah but
because I was thinking about it lah cause you know two of my exes aku came back to them right two of my exes and then it didn't work out what kan
then I was thinking kalau if I were to get back with this ex kan
like I remember merepek gila ya allah I don't know it was like macam I think it was after his performance or something
okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where kita naik tau he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat tu
abeh dah sampai buona vista eh was it buona vista
so I just left keluar gitu I just left like that
and I just leave him dekat seorang seorang and
I recently yang we got back I mean not we got back like I added I mean added him on err instagram kan ya ya he followed me back so
err aku dia
aku told him lah okay actually it was very funny because aku
can I be honest I say ya sure sure lepas tu dia cakap
err you are a very sensitive person gini gini semua abeh dia cakap um it's better kau boleh tone down sikit kau punya err sensitivity but I was reading it and I was triggered
you know macam you don't tell me not to be sensitive but okay lah aku appreciate his err feedback
tak actually seriously dia dia baik tau because kan um but dia pun sayang aku
baik lah cuma aku jer shitty
that's why aku
that's why I said tadi ah I was telling myself I said you know if I could turn back time
actually kan aku rasa kalau aku tak break up dengan dia kan aku rasa kita dah ada anak seh dah kahwin because kita okay lah ya in that book right we actually wrote err when to get married and stuff like that we actually plan to get married when kita twenty seven tau twenty seven years old so kau imagine
or at least two kids seh ya so sekarang macam aku dengan dia both
plans pun tak work out
I mean I've been wanting to do that actually but I just telling I was just telling myself like jangan main gila jangan main gila
but I think aku dream about him because I've been looking at his instagram story
err that time I found out he just putus tunang actually he's a very private person tau because that time he tunang then he didn't post his tunang face
so it was like dia tunjuk okay ah okay err yang gambar ni aku tak tak nampak because back then aku tak follow him yet but it was my friend lah who showed me that picture so it was like just a picture of a bouquet of flowers and a ring so ya lah to show that you know dia dah tunang
but recently yang kita met back tu at a wedding
aku aku random ah aku tanya dia eh mana tunang kau
oh dia macam oh err takde ah
then that's when I know he dah putus tunang
but I don't know whether he's seeing anyone or not because takkan aku nak cakap dengan dia eh kau seeing anyone ke tak you know like
actually macam aku fikir balik kan it's amazing how I remember all my exes punya birthday
kan aku I don't know what's wrong but I remember his birthday so I was thinking like mm maybe ada ada ada ada tu eh
mm ada lah end of january
ya so we'll see lah we'll see maybe maybe I will just like ask him ke like hey wanna grab a coffee
okay nanti nearer to his birthday kau remind aku this ah
because aku takut I will ask him the question instead
ya hopefully hopefully because like macam next year kan dia dah turn thirty kan
ya so like bila dia turn thirty tu orang cakap wiser a bit lah it's like throw away your twenties and then start thirty with something new
eh nanti kan dah habis just tekan yang tick tu tau
lepas ni I can't wait to eat our sushi
how can you forget dia kat depan jer seh
okay lah jap lagi lagi berapa minit jer actually it's like what almost it's only it's like one minute left seh
cepat kan kan aku cakap this thing is like an easy job for us
macam gitu jer lah aku punya love life
ayah dulu first kerja ayah kerja apa
wah kalau gitu ayah kerja lama seh adik tak boleh imagine seh kalau macam kerja lama gitu
sampai about how many years eh ayah kerja dekat alfa laval
sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun hais macam tak pernah dengar seh ah
so bila ayah kerja dulu dekat uh alfa laval then you don't think macam maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
memang dah planning kan dah kan
so ada apa yang macam very interesting tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke like the machine dia style tu
tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa sledgehammer
yang the the like the big punya sledgehammer itu ah
wah kira kan bagus seh pakai allen key jer senang seh
nowadays macam actually banyak like really a lot of things dia orang nak tukar
jadi macam manufacturing kan even macam sekarang
like now my workplace macam construction ah pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam manufacturing
ya ya ya ya actually true ah so macam dia orang ah actually dia orang nak buat kan benda tu ah datang jer kan
terus terus in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish ah
ayah rasa the houses eh because now they actually want to do a house
ah yang pagar kayu tahu the whole you imagine eh macam the whole building
mm actually kalau macam they use wood kan dia orang cakap ah it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like uh the wood banyak tapi macam macam uh the besi is steel kan dia orang kena mine
ah so that's why like uh kalau kayu kan senang dia chop jer lepas tu dia dia process
kan cepat habis dia punya plank tu banyak
sekarang macam dekat dalam news kan dia kan ada banyak cerita macam climate change ayah dengar tak cerita ni
macam dia cakap oh dia ada ah perubahan alam
ah dia ada tukar macam oh ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula ah you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly eh tempat tu tak banyak snow
oh yang itu ada ah
so kalau macam ayah
ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak over the years eh yang in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the udara ke or anything like that
so ayah rasa macam tak apa ah kalau dia lagi banyak shopping centre then
this climate change tu kira kan boleh boleh adapt ah
tapi ah so far ah ayah tak tahu anybody yang got this COVID right
so ah pada ayah macam yang this ah COVID ni ah ayah think will last how long
tapi dia orang cakap mm dia orang cakap mula mula it comes from china kan because like dia punya china tu dekat situ kan
dia orang ada dia orang they like to eat a lot of like macam weird weird punya animal tahu
oh so macam ayah fikir actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
ayah baca tak yang there's this uh group of people kan yang dia orang army plane habis lepas tu dia orang
ah dia orang fikir oh never mind lah because it's a private plane habis dia orang turun kan lepas tu yang eropah punya
the europe punya people say eh ah don't come because you're from ah please go home
ah ayah baca tak
oh ya dekat dekat eh the inside of the dormitory kan it's really uh it
according to my workers ah dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada ah but unfortunately lah kirakan kalau you're from china eh yang the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix dengan yang chinese because dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya tapi sekarang is like tapi of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the uh sickness because if not then people will be very macam macam racist kan dengan dia orang ah pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak ah actually
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad kan macam aku I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
oh is it abang abang punya party
oh the the khatam quran party is it
oh I don't remember kena check temperature actually
oh dah boleh clear ah
tapi ayah rasa like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada benda lain in yang ayah ingat ah that is the worst thing than this COVID
so uh apa tu jadi if now eh bila ayah tengok macam movie movie macam zombie zombie kan
ah ayah continue tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang kan now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak what story is like super takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang ah
tapi that cannibalism is not even fake seh it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story kan dia orang macam cepat gila kan like the they the they run you know
orang hantu apa seh itu
oh so you're actually like actually the actual human yang human yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada
so macam hantu biasa macam ah you can just
walk away ah katakan
tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah retire kan so ayah rasa freedom tak macam
I I don't need to care about like all this you know hantu or all these you people
so ah apa tu jadi bila ayah dah retire so after dah you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work ah macam gitu
so ah apa itu bila dulu kan ayah
um mula mula start kerja then you said that the kan ayah ada kerja kat tempat glass kan
ah so dulu dekat singapore dia ada banyak factory eh pasal I don't think sekarang ada company glass dekat singapore
dia punya cerita semua sama eh kena retrenched ah
macam kirakan fated ah
so sekarang kirakan macam free and easy
ah then everyday bangun and then just macam
uh buat itu ah uh if there's planning today then just buat jer lah gitu
so ayah rasa macam hidup gini all the way till the end okay ke tidak
so kalau actually eh macam sekarang kan dia banyak gila technology kan
ah ayah rasa technology ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam technology ni macam
susah kan nak cakap
dulu ayah favourite subject apa eh like when in school lah
so bila ayah when you read kan those kind of stories kan do you feel macam actually bila dia jajah satu country tu dia bagus ke um good or bad
so bila dulu uh kan yayi is actually malaysian right
oh yayi
oh actually so pasal tu nyai will come to singapore
so tapi yang that time yang yang yang apa tu the the separation kan
dia dia announcement ke apa
so it was actually senang gila seh
oh so actually you got lucky ah kirakan
so actually macam ayah pun tak march sangat ah kirakan
actually dulu pun like when I first err fikir kan like what to do kan actually I also wanted to join uh the army
because like the army macam to me macam dia semua macam easy ah kan
ah then lepas tu you you you can rise up the rank and then kerja dia macam not so bad lah
tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam army pun macam apa tu stoning kan dia orang ikut the rules and then
ah macam pelik kan it's like what what what's it for ah but I mean I can maybe understand lah dia orang semua nak untuk buat
like you're disciplined tapi there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
macam somehow dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu suddenly everything macam not so bad
quite positive kan ah macam oh you can remember the good times ah
ah it it like life is like that kan macam dulu like apa tu err that time when the adik dalam police eh oh my god sia
like so hot and then lepas tu dia punya push up don't say ah
ah dia punya push up dah apa tu wah sekarang sekarang nak buat push up macam gitu pun tak boleh seh tapi dulu wah you know so good you know
ah and then lepas tu dia orang and then dia punya army officer semua cara dia sama kan
ah dia
muka kirakan semua macam yang itu ah yang kak inah tak minat
so macam dia orang semua nak kena they have this macam angkuh punya muka ah eh
ah tapi tak tahu ah maybe it's just not fated ah that I you know that I didn't join the army ah forget it sia tengok
a'ah tapi bagus juga seh kalau hari hari pakai uniform senang seh like you don't need to think you wake up
ah so macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam MINDEF kan so like although he's in construction eh
dia nothing to do with him you know eh whatever that happen outside eh dia macam oh okay
macam MINDEF kan is very big so kalau dia orang if there's anything eh dia orang nak kena buat
ah in within the MINDEF itself ya dia orang mesti nak ada manager yang kat dalam yang boleh buat construction
macam ya like no feeling to scared ke takut ke kena buang kerja nothing ya
tapi ayah dah err I mean like I you speak to them sekali sekala ah at least
apa sal ada banyak secret ke
so mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya then uh too bad lah because like you're in warehouse pe
actually ayah dulu ada license apa eh
ayah ada license forklift kan
ya lah macam wasted money ah pasal call crane
ah lah pasal macam sama ah macam construction kalau ada crane masuk kan it's like oh my god seh
like dia orang semua like you cannot even walk there and then ya
ah actually servicing kebanyakannya is really buang habuk
dia dia buang habuk jer lepas tu nanti is if if really something wrong kan
ah dia cakap ah change part jer ah semua
maybe pun tak gerak seh pasal there's not much things kan sekarang
ya so sekarang macam the situation dengan si COVID ni is a bit weird kan pasal banyak benda macam just stop
pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang kan macam like ke apa tu yang the funny thing is that yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik ah habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru seh
ah is aku I don't even use the baju half of the time in pyjamas macam I pergi kerja pun pyjamas ha
dulu kirakan macam so bila ayah dah masuk warehousing tu then lepas tu like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard lah kirakan
ayah tak pakai itu ke umbrella
so it's like macam after you get out kan macam lain gila kan macam
itu ah kerja actually macam technical officer is actually pretty ah dia dia actually quite senang
a'ah so itu ah so tengok ah maybe adik pun will just become a technical officer ah
pasal kau if like you kerja all the way construction
is like lagi senang nak check orang punya kerja kan daripada nak buat you punya kerja sendiri
ah itu lah dia tapi actually sekarang kan dia orang banyak yang ah banyak
dia orang suka just berdiri and then suruh orang lain buat they don't want to go down themselves
itu yang masalah dia ah itu yang banyak yang macam singapore punya manager ah yang susah
I mm so you're saying like dia tak tahu ah actually
actually that's true ah itu yang dia punya the difference kan I think we talk about this before yang macam if you work for a
ah if the kalau dia punya engineer turun kan daripada australia ke apa then kalau kau tak turun dengan dia kan
ah then dia macam tengok engkau hello I'm going down sia you not going down meh gitu a'ah
ah tapi kalau macam singapore punya wah clean ah berdiri jer kasi yang the poor bangla eh ah
a'ah tapi tu tapi sekarang bangla semua pun tak ada
pasal sekarang pun dah ah semalam I met my friend
dia cakap on construction site kan cuma ada enam belas orang
adik cakap construction kau kau buat apa seh pondok
sixteen people to finish one construction wah bila masa nak habis sepuluh tahun pun tak habis
aku rasa a'ah satu swimming pool habis dia cakap no no no no I need to to build a school
habis adik cakap habis adik cakap dia punya school ni
dah setengah jalan ke or baru start baru start seh
tak cukup ah ah habis dia orang cakap ah they keep saying eh macam oh ah they giving green light green light
tapi yang green light ini actually belum
uh still go to the construction site mostly all cannot ah itu dia punya problem ah
ah so ah itu yang I don't know when to finish ah dia punya project habis dia orang kita so macam sixteen eh
habis kau imagine eh macam nak carry benda tapi nak kena distance uh tak boleh kan very weird lah dia punya rules
ah tapi tak tahu ah ini bila nak habis kan mm so tengok ah macam mana
tapi apa tu ayah ayah tengok tak yang macam yang dekat america banyak orang tak nak pakai mask
tapi pelik kan I don't know why macam dia orang err apa tu really really go against err apa tu dia ah nak pakai mask ni padahal pakai mask tu macam tak ada apa apa per
ah I don't know ah when when is this going to end pun really not sure
ya so tengok ah apa tu harap harap everything is okay lah kan
so tak tahu ah tengok ah macam mana habis mummy tak cakap apa apa ke
yang pasal yang macam COVID ini ke apa
ayah ada berapa banyak seh
wah dah dah dah planning ah
chey pasal dulu kan apa tu kan susah kan nak dapat singaporean
ten years tak boleh masuk malaysia apasal eh
so is apa untuk tunjukkan like you're patriotic ah kirakan
oh so dia dia really macam nak uh apa tu
tapi kalau macam if you go back kalau then you must take some some
letter ke atau pun macam tak atau they just tak tak tak consider you as patriotic ah
oh so kirakan macam apa tu dia dia really control lah ya
mm habis nyai is nyai singaporean
so dia bila dia convert seh
oh on the independence day itself dia boleh convert tapi apasal ayah tak convert
macam there is something ah to show like you really want to be a singaporean lah
bila ayah first uh cakap that pledge eh tapi ayah ayah sekolah pun kat singapore so it's not that hard lah
ah yang itu actually adik pun kena buat lah benda tu oh zaman zaman silam kan a'ah
ah up to you but preferably uh mungkin tiga ah three
okay okay understand okay and the next question will be what was the most memorable meal yang you ever had where did you actually have it
makan apa-apa ah macam kau pernah pergi overseas apa semua kan
but but was it like you say makan dengan ramen was it like sashimi punya type or is it cook or
oo but then then um the you say mm makan whale kan
macam dia punya texture
so you wasn't you you're like tak pasti juga lah whether it's the it's the isi of the whale of the fats of the whale
uh next question if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life apa yang you will eat like what would it be
the four seasons or you prefer macam singapore punya weather
understand okay so uh when you are in tokyo or japan kan so err for the halal restaurants that you went cause I read somewhere lah in some blogs or articles right that even though for halal restaurants they do actually serve alcoholic beverages betul ke
tu lah that's why I I read at the apa halal travel blogs mm
mm okay tell me recently ada benda like
yes skills ah kira like macam
wah you know so much about this karate martial arts semua thingy
yes so like whatever you have paid for before kan kira macam pada kau when you think back apa yang
uh engkau rasa macam like apakah sesuatu yang kau harap benda tu sebenarnya boleh jadi percuma ah
okay then after that next question ee kita dah nak our time
kalau kita dah dah tak payah kerja ah
kira activities seharian macam apakah yang akan menjadi suatu penyeksaan jika dilakukan selama lapan jam berturut-turut I would say work but
activity ah macam like working out ke
ni interesting gila ni
ah self right like uh nasihat some nasihat what would it be
maybe time time kau poly ah
kira kau poly
last kakak kerja dekat intern twelve cupcakes
um kak kerja as baker um tolong macam
ah kakak dalam err cupcake department macam tolong
apa um ah scoop cupcake better err tolong decoration lepas tu tolong macam taruh
dekat oven ah bakar lah jaga oven semua uh apa kalau ada macam bahan-bahan yang kena refill then akak kena buat
of course penat lah tapi kakak ada macam learn untuk menjadi seorang yang berdikari
um dekat kerja kakak belajar untuk uh apa selalu ada keyakinan diri um
um saling bantu bantu membantu antara satu sama lain uh haruslah komunikasi sebagai pasukan kerana uh apabila kita err ingin melakukan kerja bekerjasama
kami haruslah berkomunikasi supaya kami tahu uh uh dan dan dan kerja kita akan jalan dengan lancar yup
um kadang-kadang ada jugalah ada ada yang kadang-kadang rasa macam mereka lebih tahu
lebih lebih apa macam mereka lebih tahu lah and then ingin menunjuk-nunjuk
ah tapi ah saya tidak apa ni uh kerana mereka rasa begitu kerana mereka takut um mereka rasa ditepi diketepikan semasa bekerja then ya um tetapi
mereka juga um um ada juga merupa bakat yang sangat bagus lah mereka dah sudah mahir dalam bidang itu ya
um selalunya ada ah contoh seperti kadang-kadang aku terlambat ah masuk kerja ah
ah saya pernah terjatuhkan uh apa ni
terjatuhkan cupcake batter di lantai
uh and then habis kotor di lantai ah and then saya haruslah mop
um yang apa yang saya telah berselerakkan eh apa ni um
saya pun juga pernah tidak mengikut arahan err kerana semasa kawan kerja saya err
ingin ke waktu rehat dia telah mengatakan saya untuk jangan membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven tetapi saya degil then saya tetap uh lakukannya
selepas berapa minit kemudian saya apa uh uh bila saya tengah buat kerja saya masing-masing saya
terlupa err yang saya sudah apa membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven saya tidak mendengar saya saya tidak mendengar timer dan ia hangus
err then saya saya amat terperanjat dan juga berasa serba salah kerana sudah membazir cupcake itu
uh uh kawan kerja saya ah
err terkejut juga then menegur saya uh supaya uh saya tidak melakukan kesilapan itu lagi
ah betul kakak telah uh mempelajari untuk mengikut arahan dan jangan bertindak uh sendirian jika tidak pasti kerana kadang-kadang kita apabila kita rasa kami kita
um mungkin kakak ingin err belajar dalam bidang mengajar uh early childhood kerana saya suka berbual dengan uh anak-anak kecil dan juga ingin mengongsi err ilmu yang saya telah pelajari
err pernah satu incident apabila saya di kedai sedang ingin sedang menunggu
sedang apa um mengambil air sambil menunggu saya ternampak seorang budak sedang memain dengan bottle like yang
ia ingin flip bottle itu then
mahu uh ingin bottle itu uh berdiri dan budak itu um err melihat saya dan ingin mengimpress saya dengan dia punya skills then saya saya hanya senyum dan melihat uh adik itu dan um
uh mengatakan syabas kepada dia like good job because dia dapat flip bottle itu dan dia dia berusaha berusaha sehingga dia dapat stand bottle itu
um ya um apa apabila uh
anak anak kecil err um senyum ketawa saya gembira
um memang betul uh susah nak jaga budak-budak kecil sebab kita pun dulu budak-budak kecil tapi kalau kita orang
dah minat dengan err example bidang early childhood um
uh kita haruslah apa um kalau kita ingin tahu macam mana nak jaga anak-anak kecil ini kita boleh belajar dalam bidang early childhood kita belajar untuk uh cara untuk handle um budak-budak kecil ini
dengan but apabila sudah banyak kali uh practice err training
err cara tahu cara technique untuk berbual dengan anak-anak kecil uh yang agak mudah mudah juga
ya um sama seperti ibu bapa juga sebab uh jika we jika kita mengatakan uh mereka
err ada anak then dia orang apa kena um mengatasi masalah itu juga err untuk menghandle anak mereka
um teknologi boleh menjadi err boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah err yang faedah dia
macam dalam pelajaran uh um cikgu boleh memberi assignment kepada murid-murid um err contohnya kalau ada E learning
um anak-anak muda um
murid um dari dari um muda mereka senang untuk catch up um their skills especially in technology
mereka senang untuk uh belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah
dan mereka juga boleh err learn new skills from the internet because um but
yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini err ialah social media um mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan
err perkara yang di luar yang trend yang yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri
err contohnya seperti uh ada seorang celebrity
mereka melakukan trend uh yang mungkin boleh membahayakan dan apabila anak-anak muda melihat itu mereka rasa mereka juga ingin melakukan
ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya um tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya
err dengan itu saya rasa social media err technology haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin
ah untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna technology dengan baik mereka uh uh techonology ialah perkara um it's a safe platform for them
um ya kakak ingat dulu bila kita kecil um kita dulu kita orang uh
usually entertain diri sendiri dengan menggunakan komputer dan ada ada game permainan di komputer dan kami err main sebanyak mungkin ia juga agak menarik
err tetapi uh kami sebab kami
err ada adik-beradik kan uh kami kena ambil giliran
dan kadangkala kami gaduh pasal err giliran siapa untuk memain game di komputer
kami juga um uh di kami melihat err cerita dalam err pada zaman dahulu lah tapi zaman sekarang uh kami tidak pakai lagi kami boleh tengok online saja
ia memudah untuk generasi muda sekarang um ya

okay so ni lisa ni like how I don't think the the
I I've I seen phone cases where you can um like print macam pictures on the phone case I'm thinking that you are saying like macam a picture sort of thinkers the frame pictures that's what
that's what sarah is saying right and then ah dekat
plaza sing there is um the kedai tingkat dua depan pizza hut where you can make
ya correct kalau macam can
a tote bag with our pictures then they go to like macam supermarket
macam aww I have my tribe with me while I go buy some bawang
photo book you you you are right cause I have friends who give me photo book I look it on memories aww then cry then after that taruk dalam kotak and then like
when you clean up your house baru buka oh ya I remember this rachel give it to me two years ago ah what
I think kita like err we can just do
okay I think got like dua minggu to
the way she's guarded now is like ah whatever ah sembarang ah on ah go jer like she she she ya
eh lighter mana like lighter mana
ya ya ya and then I just she she tried to be the again the the the kakak kakak like trying to make jokes I was just like
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole bali thing with the whole tini and the bali thing and all that cause I I macam
meeting tini was just like a coincidence thing cause she dia dia kerja dekat the hostel kat mana ni clarke quay then I was working kat lima pe
so I I know that tini has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like eh babe come ah lepak ah like
ah apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima like we can just like hang out eh no that time habis kerja siang two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like haji lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in bali when me and azmi left so when me and azmi was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us tak ada apa-apa lah no lah nothing dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like macam orh this jas guy is nice memang he he he is a very lepak guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with tini cause we asked tini face to face so all these while when tini like when we when me and her hung out ah like she like oh dekat bali this happened and then he give me all these
tini macam ah macam oh dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking dia dia lupa pe sial kita like in a group ya correct then um like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just diam I just cause she she
ah she was just basically macam member lah eh jas gini gini gini I don't know I have ah macam you know commitment issues tini like of course lah kan dia dengan dia punya commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know ah this happen and then she's like oh jas told me dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah hey cause dia lupa sia correct then I
when I hear all these things from tini I'm like bullshit bullshit sial lah dia ni puki betul budak
so at some point no we hung out kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga
sabar sabar sabar sabar so
at at some point tini said this sentence um jas cakap dengan aku um macam uh I never felt like this for a girl before dia cakap gitu that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then tini just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan sarah babe
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual lah dia cakap gitu then at at some point I told sarah sarah
cause what me and azmi told her was that actually jas and tini tak ada apa-apa but when we were there memang they really like
they they told me to they told to our face eh tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas
ya jas dengan tini and then when we left back when me and azmi left first then they stay in bali apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her lah
ah so dia masih dia dia fikir dia casanova this guy sana like that so um
she just went her minah lah she did became the minah
err dia salahkan jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so ah ya then then that night happened and
ya then I'm like kau nak pergi berbual dengan sarah buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan jas I say like that dia yang buat problem pe like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to tini which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with err sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and dekat rumah dia dekat yang percil tu ah we we lepak we hung out
ah I am what was the word she used um macam berbual belakang dia ah like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole um
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like aku rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask azmi you can ask nisa or whoever was there at your birthday lah that was your birthday right my intention was really eh sarah this this happened to sarah okay sekarang like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and azmi in confident and I go out macam to her aku
ah macam lan jiao wei pasal dia babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation ah what I macam ah what I ah take from it is that ah sarah and sarah is dia always takut err she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel lah this is just my personal
um macam um how to say eh macam um
no no no like macam dia jaga conduct
like like her way her her image is dia nak kena jaga conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one ah ah I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not nangis to azmi but macam I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told azmi that I I I I know this is my niat but sometimes kadang-kadang niat baik but um you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
from then onwards I I macam I ah back off sort a little bit to really
ya ya correct cause correct tini told me ya sorry tini tini told me that um macam I've I don't open up to guys one like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she senyap this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
um like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the laksa thing we were having I was pissed off lah I feel like macam you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you macam nak buat sial kat kau you know but
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still eh jom ah lepak even though for months you been eh come ah we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
kau cakap dengan aku pasal something I don't go to ni
ah no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my macam um my intentions to ah
we and it for us like sometimes oh we talk about tini macam gini
but gossip is kau tahu dia ni
um in our macam friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me macam
ah hati dia like she wants to jaga her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
eh bilang aku bilang aku you know
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to gaduh ya and any relationship will have that macam you know macam ah ah apa err what what's that word ah friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to gaduh in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where apa aku cakap too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
kan pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas ah nak cakap nak kena
like you lah kita nak main game tak nak main ah jangan banyak cakap
kalau azmi lagi whoa
no I think he's macam sial
why why kenapa like why are you so macam anti natural things

actually it's very funny I was cause last weekend we were talking about kalau kita dah tua like duduk mana like you know and we just lepak somewhere where you know there's the sea or something you know um I was I was it's just funny I was just thinking about this if really like money is
sort of macam not a problem sort of right like I would probably macam ah tanam basil tanam
thyme tanam apa err daun bawang lah apa lah you know shit like that and then I will learn it on youtube cause like hello everything is on youtube so it's everywhere exactly ya there's facebook groups you can just join and like eh apa pasal aku punya aku punya daun ni macam senget tepi or something like that you know like
and then I will just I would probably I I picture myself like okay if let's say kat indonesia ke malaysia right
mmhmm just go to like a local school like you know ah ah ajar english ke
riding things like that macam dah sapu rumah
sapu then like err eh jom ah so time to go teach english or you know
lepak ya ya ya I see myself
ya but also it's difficult to jaga ant
he will just macam the kind of macam romeo
jangan bang jangan jangan bang ow jangan bang
main jer
pangkeng pangkeng balik rumah uncle pangkeng
then macam save duit satu minggu sekolah
save lima dollar lima dollar weekend pangkeng ah
ya it's a term that ah like minah
or you naik rumah uncle ah
rumah uncle apa sia rumah uncle
ah rumah uncle balik rumah uncle rumah uncle
or like another matrep err slang ah aku kicap kau eh gua kicap sama lu
muka kau kasih kicap eh
terus macam kau I remembered the first
time someone used that word kampung
but err we we wrote letters to each other right cause dulu tak ada tak ada social media
you know asal kau berbual dengan dia ni ah
then I'm like ah kita tulis surat ah then after that she's like tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung
gua mahu turun sekarang then
apa sia kampung
then she like kau kampung pun tak tahu sial kau ah kampung dia cakap gitu
terus aku then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my kakak angkat what is kampung so apparently ah kampung is like ah
kau budak mana it's like where are you
ah which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that lah then I was like oh abeh kira kita ni kampung apa aku tanya kakak angkat aku
and then ah she like kita budak marsiling ah cause last time I stay with my with my auntie ah in in woodlands vista point area then budak kita budak marsiling ah
then in my head in this secondary one two tak nak ah marsiling tapi kita tinggal woodland jauh seh dengan marsiling
I jalan and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that kan dia macam you can see from their face macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down tangga saw me
and then dia macam stop in the middle of tangga then I'm like uh turun jer lah kan
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like macam old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing ah ya so like that
ya marsiling punya
marsiling gua kicap sama lu budak toa payoh
that one cina cina one ah I think
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me macam cause
their their eyes is like apa kau buat kat sini so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
this group of boys tak ada judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like macam
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like boleh duduk diam like what sepuluh minit lima belas minit
but after that if they want to go down they want to lepak so they bring this boy to the playground main catching babe
main catching dengan budak-budak kat playground main bola main apa then I'm like
they even suss out um not influencers but artist sort of from other schools macam not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers
and they do hip hop ke beatboxing they gather all these people come to hwa chong and they did a fundraiser all the money that we pay is like five dollars ten dollars goes to real life stories
alahai dah banyak privilege
lagi people sayanglah aku ni yang kat depan ni sial
mm lepas tu aku gi normal sebab aku boleh sports dalam rumah
it's like you would have like I don't know macam kau ada kan
tak ada script and you have obvious obviously you have a script in front of you you know you would have practice it at home
tak ada ke macam someone like err no one plays sports in the house go normal and
ya tak ada ke like just a
ah of of people's voice actually marwah punya ex ex secretary also so like the moment I heard that I told azmi like alright
yes my vote is not a secret undi awak adalah rahsia
time semua orang tak ada kerja lain
ya so he was on my list like eh local uh local account lah like eh this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the dia punya videos was all quite macam angsty ah like
oh you see this vulgar tat tut tat semua basically like macam all the people like being annoying lah time dia tengah nak deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of dia pergi tampines mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and pasal tu time kan so we cannot go out kan and I was like oh my god I've never seen tampines mall look like that
ya serious macam like like some horror story is here
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like malam-malam buta like nine plus I was like eh this guy doing live live what sia
because at that point in time I just thought macam he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like oh wow wow he cause it
yes abang grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that um based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind yang like cause of like his friends dulu kat secondary school semua kan and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like apa ni bro
he actually he has the beng vibes but the most kekek thing is like the way he talks is very macam narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
kelakar lah like
ya it's quite bahan actually
exactly so I think actually by right dia punya target audience is
all following you it's so scary you know oh my god like there was this kid dia macam
I was like I say asal this budak like freaking thirsty you know
macam dia kata come live with me apa apa apa then aku was like
eww then aku press dia punya profile then I was like oh my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya oh it was so scary so and then um so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk kan is macam corporate gila
tu lah pasal dekat dia tanya um in which area do you reside I was like reside eh
first off aku dah block dia I was like saying uh don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because uh and then semalam pun like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like ah eh awkward
technically ah I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation yang pakai kan but it's still very disturbing lah but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like tak layan and then he doesn't assume anything oh ya then he was like how do I address you ah aku was like how do I address you macam then
the next for me macam the automatic response is miss farizan takkan lah kan apa seh macam merepek sia
zan ah actually aku was like alamak aku terlupa nak tukar my um name pasal it's still zan A yang ikut my um and aku was like
alamak too late to change to air lah takpe takpe lah zan lah zan jadi lah
yes oh my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you zan right and I was just like yes senpai noticed me ah terima kasih terima kasih
a'ah I was like opocot aku jadi marauder I there's actually like no real function to it ah cuma macam bragging rights jer
a'ah so I macam ah my dreams
ya I was I was like planning kalau macam ini hari kan kalau aku jumpa dia I will be like grab ge</mandarin
probably dia macam siapa then aku was like confirm tu kena instant block
oh ni dia eh yikes
tampines that's why so dekat
ya actually dekat and I kind of roughly know macam tempat dia lepak
no lah not his but his route yes because like like kat kat tak banyak tempat yang that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs yang dekat the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king dekat the
so I don't know like actually his account macam supposed to be like educational ke apa at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like aku yikes
ya and then there's the mat minah tiktok
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then aku macam what's this eh like
I macam pull apa eh macam pull follow ke apa ke macam but it's like those thirst trap punya videos
ah a'ah kan I tak faham
okay but macam maksud dia tu apa
I I was just thinking of the mat minah call
just macam
macam how did you discover that app do you remember
ya ya because macam at the start that was what it looked like kan it was macam in between musically and vine
macam there's the reputation kan
technically those people must be underage juga
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just macam by proximity like you know the few local
you're talking about macam algorithm dia
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post terus like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I macam okay all right
like then the subsequent macam views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one macam the benda-benda bodoh I don't tag it I just macam
ya so that's the thing right I was like wow I didn't know that tiktok ada live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
ya so it's um it's really interesting it's like you know how um live eh no not live eh live and live ada like the likes kan but it's just macam free kan you press
jadi boleh spam ke apa entah so apa ni like tiktok ada like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
I don't think it's that much lah because like I said macam dia punya follower base is more like budak-budak kecil so macam he will he will say say like oh thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like oh thanks for the rainbow puke and I pun macam he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk sekarang pun like dah lagi mahal bro
so like everyone is always saying stuff like oh come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel lah kan and aku was like what is this thing he's talking about
you see that's why you should donate to me dia cakap kelakar gila dia macam his humour ya
and then like I think I finished my virtual punya class and macam they just started opening that time face to babad like
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I uh I recognize the dance moves kan then I was like hey insyirah like is this afrobeat standard like ya macam how you know and all that then aku aku was telling her lah that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying oh it's that this studio da da da da so uh it took me like damn long like aku just took the information and just like buat bodoh ah until happened
and then phase two then aku was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
a super fast one and aku was like aku nak mati eh
after a long break it's just like rombak rombak and I was like ha
like and then like each five ada like segment ah then you cannot mix
then that one uh because you maintain two meters tak payah pakai mask
ya my lindy punya yang solo pun begitu uh our capacity is about twelve
so sama lah two meters and all that tak payah pakai mask tapi tu recently um because of uh partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then tu kena pakai mask ah pasal like contact
but itu pun they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance sikit jer partner ada ya
dah lama I tak joget penat gila sia I was like ugh
stamina dah turun muscle semua dah macam dah layu
that's the one yang I I started with ya so a lot of my songs are yemi alade songs ya
it's like wah I love him macam the dia punya beat dia punya percussion dia is like is like
it's not as tacky as like macam ada like dia punya ah rentak ah dia like kebak kebak means like cool
and macam I feel like dia orang punya bahasa is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like um the class introduced me to all new like new songs lah as in new and macam different artists ah artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists ke apa besides beyonce
ya oh my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so macam at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
like that's the only thing kita boleh buat like hello excuse me hello police
ya so and macam the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind yang like having fun is more important
macam you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but macam he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
ya but he very cool lah macam even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no no no actually K K jap there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then zul is one of the teachers
then hakim also teaches like um dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall macam a bit macam sexy ah I macam oof
ya then okay it's quite kekek like last two days kan I went for the same studio I tried uh homerun choreo
that one like aku nak mati sia
the person kan like mellow she's a good dancer but dia punya ajar dia macam like from the get go is like super detailed
macam my brain cannot
macam badan angle tangan angle
ah kepala angle I macam ugh
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I macam
yes and loncat-loncat
then macam I felt so demoralized ah like it's so susah and like
so for me the thing is that like kalau stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
I think cause I'm not like a fan kan I just do it cause macam it looked interesting
and then the ones next to her friends semua they were like eh today I become chicken ah I was like that's not wrong macam a lot of them their position I'm just like kenapa ayam kenapa ayam
ya macam cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
sorry ah pekak
mmhmm apa-apa pun pekak
eh lupa ah K jap
no lah okay so ceritanya is apa tau this phone the near RAM only three gig
dia punya internal kalau bukan sixteen thirty two eh
and then eh I try to log in from outram sampai past series belum log in you
disconnect lag crash semua the whole cycle
whoa macam no ya so then I could I could I really cannot you like besides gaming macam
apa eh like it's just super laggy ah macam everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal err internal memory dia dah habis kan
so like literally I was running on entah something macam hundred of free space ke apa entah
exactly so that's why macam dia punya performance pun dah macam tahi ah
huh but anyway dah dua dah dua tahun ah
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for macam work taruh like um prepaid ke apa kat dalam tu
because actually phone ni tak rosak ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
mm it's okay then now I found a new use for it lah because I was thinking eh macam mana kalau I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I akan dengar I just dengar suara dia jer
ya dah suara dia sedap
suara dia macam macam dia punya voice quality is very good
like macam okay K K uh I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M punya guide
macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak ah hmm
but this guy ah macam kau just dengar just like ya macam cool like night setting you know
ya but ini hari I think ini hari dia main muzik so
sekarang you you'll hear him like sing and stuff
macam daripada mana eh tiba-tiba kan
but like why dia need to pakai okay sorry no no no apa dia punya power actually
dia macam apa gravity ke
I was like huh macam-macamnya power dia
kalau kau kalau kau watch three a day
kalau twenty three sikit jer
eh kalau you tengok six a day tau six a day by right empat hari dah habis twenty four
kau rewatch eh
rasa macam escapism which I'm like oh macam I don't like to be too close to reality
it was the most merepek ah okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that bandai has released recently that's not the most merepek
but it's the most macam fantasy lah like super idealistic you know macam the guy must must always get the girl and then ada rival ada love triangle
that's rude ya macam
habis orang mati one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
ya macam oh and then um they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere macam
because at that time kan that uh macam the way you pilot is still macam pakai macam like you driving gitu ah you akan pakai um got the apa macam clutch semua and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart macam the later on the animes kan they they used macam uh like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much lah you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it uh I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves ke apa entah like okay sure like that's fine
like macam if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like macam gitu lah they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like oh macam drop drop from the sky gitu like merepek
ya because it's mm it's a bit dia punya plot
there's then gundam got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the gundam sampai like
and then they continue macam star wars gitu ah so it's like wah the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya but that one was okay but it was macam eh a bit too that one a bit too fantasy ah
ya betul
ya it's always senang kalau nak cakap
because you're not in that situation apa
ya I see that a lot on twitter also macam they will like err retweet those those um am I am I am I an asshole punya post
and then dia orang just like throw the whole man away lah apa you know macam like ya like macam
I guess you can write that way but macam think about how that person is like going through right
ya macam kau they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something aku rasa
then macam huh okay itu jer like ya that's what I was thinking oh actually kalau I wanted to catch up session quite easy
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore punya what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
ya but that's the thing lah macam
but macam it's very like we we call it like what anime typical lah canon typical violence
so macam entah leh
but our censorship selalu macam tu
kau rembat jer
kekek jer sia
ya like ho kita cool
kan kita dah besar
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like and stuff right they will put like macam sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers kat bawah macam
it sound so weird but macam
like in the science textbook they always show you macam
alah benda tu macam benda biasa jer bagi dia
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about macam like
and is it okay but I think it's really like macam commendable lah that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but macam
wait kejap dia interested ke dia macam intrigued
it's just like macam thinking about it
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar
masa tu like my god is sixteen
so it's like so meluat
when I jumpa that my malaysian friend I was like duh
as in I didn't say it macam explicitly but I was like dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa
macam the perangai and cara dia cakap and cara dia like um carry himself is so reminiscent of that I just I was just nice I was like you sound like um I was just trying to be nice
give the full burn satu
mm a'ah yang mana
oh pasal apa eh
oh wow mesti of course and his father is like
oh wow mesti of course
totally wrong ke it's okay it's okay
kat masjid dia orang ah
dia orang ada Q&A session ke apa
wow habis no one was able macam curious cat version
macam he's trying lah
did they show the questions yang she wrote
it's not like macam lame questions kan like those questioning the fundamentals eh
ya lah pasal hari-hari orang just setakat tanya um
ah is smoking haram
macam dah stop it sia like
okay for her everywhere and jalan
okay so orang ni tanya soalan and then they
so dia dia received the question so ustaz tu received the question lepas tu dia dia just simpan dia tak address on the spot
it's true lah I guess it's macam it's getting better these days like definitely but macam
ya ya like kat rumah ya
sekejap eh dia actress dia pakai tudung
macam macam like if it does not add to the plot right kenapa nak bagi sangat orang tu
so kacau macam kau nak tidur lepas tu dengan pin pin dia semua
oh macam uh yang instant ah
I see like unless dia orang nak cakap orang-orang malaysia semua like sleep with tudung like that lah
step like I was going to say step alim but is that rude
bodoh kan
orh macam
macam tak ada ke tak ada ke model lain eh kata shampoo eh
atau macam at least just maybe like say macam the fragrance is nice or something and then like
what mask itu kerja ah
then bila kau nak buat kau nya business sia
then bila kau nak buat you buy the materials and then you never cut
a little similar tak apa lah asalkan it's
okay kita pakai dia orang punya prompt
diam lah betul betul lah

ya all about me lah then jampi what
like I don't bother about or like because I don't know what's the background story of their families lah then why should I waste like my jampi on them
if somebody wants to jampi another marriage or something then just tell lah why do you need to use jampi sia
so that means the hantu is okay with male what
ah okay ah why don't we split the hantu
the family using all of these but to me this is all merepek and like syirik
ya but I I really don't believe until like it it's like closer to me now alamak mama balik pula

why do you think nenek and atuk keep saying that uh mesti bapa kau pakai benda untuk mak kau and everything which I find like macam merepek sia apa sia kau percaya benda merepek ni semua but
and then the wife like macam tunduk dekat dia
and then this pelindung is fighting with etol's thing so that's why I still can think rationally like no I don't want this marriage but that thing also is like playing around and say no you want this marriage
I think kita pergi sudah lah

really really like like gila babi sia
entah eh macam banyak gila like like everywhere
rabak rabak dok mahal gila sekarang like dulu eh dulu time kita potong rambut eh
aku rasa seven eight dollars ah or even lesser ah five dollars ah maybe sekarang basic haircut jer dah at least dua puluh like twenty dollars like walao eh jialat heavy
basic lor for me I look at it like very basic orh like entah simple ah potong jer ah biasa jer ah
ya ah I mean if like the normal normal people lah like you know like the neighbourhood people all confirm scared one lah sia like last like you know you go to pakcik-pakcik place last time like very welcome you know pakcik-pakcik like more
lepak then they talk about mat rock mat rock all music all
I cut at home I got shaver right then I alamak how to cut ah ah one time ah one time ah one time ah botak ah botak ah botak simple ah I mean tak keluar pun duduk rumah lepak rumah jer lek-lek ah
um most of the time entah eh lepak makan err
exercise chey step badan badan step abang body ah step ah it's don't know like really exercise ah bo pian leh like
I tell you stay at home you confirm fall sick one ah rabak gila sia
every night I think we we we did like macam apa
covered thirty days thirty days sial wah gila babi sia thirty days
gila thirty days
so you see them from a virtual screen macam everyone dalam kotak-kotak sendiri so pelik ah but
ya ya pity them ah that one rabak ah or people who are you know alone lonely ah nobody to talk to ah wah
stop lah not say stop lah like there's still a lot of restriction ah I know there's a at least we still can now can at least go out meet people or you just be out alone you know just lepak lepak or what but of course keep a safe distance lah
ah then at least people you know it's good to be outside ah like you stuck at home wah mati sia mati mati mati confirm mati one but but but good lah we can go out
ya I heard ah rabak eh rabak sia like that one hour or maybe they have a few few hours only to go out then very strict wah rabak rabak but rabak one is in india ah wah the police rembat sia the police wah that one that one really rabak ah the police rembat the people who go out but then you know it's not supposed to be that way lah but then what to do they have to be very strict right but hopefully it's not going on now lah
entah semua busy semua macam
busy ah biasa lah family people
wan G also work busy he also dia baru cakap sikit hari rabak sia kerja macam recently start rabak ah after public holiday macam err apa kerja daripada pagi dia start pukul sepuluh habis pukul satu pagi that kind
ah kat rumah orh
work from home orh ah rabak gila like rabak gila
but tak tahu ah but dia dapat keluar weekends ah but I think weekends also he go out also spend time with wife orh like what else he can do right
tak tak isyad pun ada cakap juga the part wan G wan G turun sekejap ah but entah I think they got family event ah ke apa entah tak tahu ah but tak kesah ah at least they go out ah
lama gila dok
aku rasa the last kita jam before circuit breaker atau
kita tak jam terus lepas balik yang vietnam punya show lama lama gila lama gila babi
like semua semua put on hold lah okay lah but at least other bands macam ada jam ah like space ya quite active lah like no cause we also we we also
like take some time off just to do the mixing lah but I think cause that time we prioritise on that first lah cause dah lama gila seh like hold back kita punya recording
entah tengok ah tapi dah habis ah dah habis mix dah habis finally habis ah like dah swee ah tinggal hantar mastering then lepas tu
tak tahu we still finding for for people lor um
tak ah err overseas ah
tak tahu dorang boleh dapat sound dia ke tak
kalau haji hussin boleh
err oh tu dia punya mixing mastering suite eh
tak nanti nanti aku berbual dengan dorang ah try to talk to them we also finding ah we will be sitting down
I don't know ah that's the plan ah I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like kita release macam all one shot kan nanti macam people get bored easily ah like ah so kita punya style gitu ah I mean is four songs only apa it's not it's not like a whole album lah if whole album then
what what's the whole concept ah you know what I mean the whole concept of the is macam is all err is is interconnected ah is like err is like err macam a story ah from song number one to song number four
ah yes concept album so semua macam interconnected ah there's a story to it ah
so kita plan macam release song by song right then every song ada different artwork
budget ah see what kind of concept lah then also must pay for mastering err then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see ah we'll see how it goes ah pelan-pelan ah pelan-pelan kayuh ah
tapi dia still macam part of it pe part of us dia tak keluar like know tak keluar in a bad terms dia keluar in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning pe ya so then tak kesah ah then we will we'll see how ah kita nanti duduk berbual we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
entah tengah rabak juga ah
pasal dia was working dekat mana eh
dia was working dekat
then lepas tu err circuit breaker dia kena laid off just like that
baru masuk orh baru masuk like I think one month plus two months ah
then kena laid off so dia struggle ah but I think he's doing graphic design and also food delivery ah but okay eh the food delivery actually actually cannot help cannot help ah
so not bad ah I mean simple don't want to make it over very overly mix if not like rabak sia like like overly produced
duh rabak rabak rabak rabak rabak that one rabak but okay lah we see lah
tu lah
tapi aku rasa kalau touring kan confirm tak so soon punya confirm lama lagi seh
aku tahu aku tahu aku tahu pasal siti nak kahwin
tu ah abeh macam mana kacau mesti kacau punya abeh macam mana orang nak kahwin
tapi kau dah set seh
aku rasa dia masih cakap the the only girl in the family
tapi depends ah individual pe tapi tak tahu ah tak tahu tak tahu apa pasal lah eh but maybe sekarang memang period dia nak tak tahu aku tak tahu maybe dorang buat grand ke tapi
ya but entah lah eh
I think he doesn't show ah he doesn't show that he needs to struggle lah but but before that dia he was okay what when he he haven't got he was going to get married I I
oh ya lah beli rumah cause rumah expensive but then got pe
ya aku tak tahu tapi
but then again both kerja full-time pe full-time should be able to sustain apa macam kalau you say you like freelancer okay ah of course ah that one jialat but but full-time confirm every month you will get
tapi pun depends ah if how big of a house you want to buy ah I mean if you technically if you one time you want to buy one big house of course it's quite expensive lah but if you start small anyway houses you can sell what you know some people will start small buy three room first ah
if not ah if us ah walao confirm confirm huru-hara one macam apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni
nanti aku depressed dengan duit orang dengan aku sendiri stress seh eh macam mana ni
tapi tu rabak juga sia kalau dia cabut
tapi estee power ah estee pandai manage ah
but entah lah
tapi okay lah band band aku missy shoot pun
missy shoot pun nak record lah so tapi kita take it easy pasal sekarang I mean hakim is busy with work rabak gila aku macam dah beberapa minggu sia tak jumpa dia ajak lepak tak jumpa ajak lepak tak jumpa
dia jam dekat sini tapi dia actually tak reply message
bila dorang book
dia tengah busy
dia so dorang tak ada dia dorang message dia tengah busy dia tak dia tak dia tak dia tak reply pasal tengah busy kan so dia belum cakap dia okay ke tak then suddenly they book
they book already ah dorang dah book huh serious ah dorang dah book semalam aku tak reply sia
then dia turun ah tu pasal aku rasa dia lambat cause dia kena settle family benda punya pe I mean he work also busy already then he needs to spend time with family so bo pian ah
ya tapi okay lah but missy shoot pasal kita selalu jam also on weekdays jadi dia pun tengah busy tapi kita tengok lah but definitely the plan is to record at least by
hujung tahun ni ah
tak tahu ah
I think sial is very influential macam banyak influence err orang-orang probably also cause of
dia female fronted
abeh and then nyanyi malay lagu melayu
then very very strong musical apa
bagus juga rare juga nampak band macam gitu like playing macam
betul aku realise that juga
I mean aku ikut korang yang time europe tour aku realise actually aku get to see many things
but then again I think the twenty four hours pun macam can feel the vibe lah pasal you are still macam dekat another country orh then you see like even though macam say for example eh for example kau main germany ah but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different ah
so at least you get to see that culture know macam berlin really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very ni and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very kampung like in kampung ah but then
macam save cost ah kau tak payah spend duit on macam err apa lodging dorang will kasi kau crash tempat dorang I mean that's the give and take ah you know
I mean I think dia maybe that his style ah if he don't like that culture or not say culture ah he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go lah
ah same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks ah two weeks pun dah cukup
cause kalau tak rabak sia kau
cause aku realise siti is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social apa instagram
she can travel alone dia boleh travel alone pergi macam
ah tu pasal ah
gila cause aku realise cause bila that time kita dekat london tu then dia willing to go jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai explore seh like like she knows her way ah like to to just explore ah dia tak takut she got she's fearless ah but I think
that something yang holding her back ah
ya but tak tahu ah
aku pun nak tour lah dengan macam urgent matter I mean missy shoot lain sikit lah pasal kalau nak tour
probably lagi susah lah pasal lal pun macam iman's league right and then it's very
it'll be hard lah I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was iman's league ah then he came back so but I think he he still very on lah he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask eh does this ni kena tak
then macam tak ah ni tak kena ah ni very very iman's league ah okay tak apa then dia akan tukar to change to kita punya vibe
selalunya is dol or most of the time is dol lah
he he he did give some ideas err when we take in some ideas some ideas macam tak kena lah pasal it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into macam very rubik's vibes
you know ah dia macam
err but he will try to control he he don't want to macam dia tak nak tukar the sounds
ah bad religion I mean influence ah cause we influence with bad religion abeh macam influence with rise against dol punya influence is heavily rise against
heavy lal is very melodic guy lal suka melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with macam he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he dia banyak macam on that vibe but aku is more very bad religion penny wise ah
ah propagandhi err that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but bagusnya everything is jumble up you see so semua dah jumble up semua dah macam
biasa ah
but entah eh
dia macam very err straight kan
tapi dorang tak tahu ah zul dah tak cakap dengan ni ah dengan bob ah eh practise ah single pedal aku feel playing single pedal
yang buat dia very unique ah dia macam unique gila ah but then ah to each its own ah style ah ya but see ah see ah I don't know ah we still got a
betul dorang dah boring ah
bad religion still stick to that sound but then ada modern element I feel ah that's how I feel
he got a vibe ah a different vibe I still like bad religion ah cause dorang
cause they very abang abang
I don't know ah he some pop punkers like feeling feeling tapi macam
entah very kental ah I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing ah
tapi tengah set ah
then will send us then cakap okay err ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit
err then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then bila time jumpa baru like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then dah lah see how pasal kita record with no clicks then very simple err
miking macam drums only four mikes err so that's why some sound macam really tak boleh dapat and stuff lah but we this is like a trial ah for me lah it's a trial ah but then nanti tengok ah like in future future recording kita do it like better ah
cause hakim macam dah offer eh next recording aku aku will make sure like all the all the miking will be better lah
ya lah that's why dia dia discovered tu pasal that time actually dia offered to macam eh macam kau nak rerecord balik kau punya drum but then
ah but then aku cakap eh tak ada click orh we don't play with click so it's gonna be susah sia like okay lah we try ah I did record like what um we tried half a song ah but it's difficult cause there's no click
tak feel ah like tak feel ah so then I think then I told him next time ah like the next time we we we try to record
cause he discover but good thing that but good ah he's very hardworking dia discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input lah but then again it's not a bad recording ah this time
correct but then have to be patient ah but then but then again for example this spacedays punya
spacedays punya vibe is because we we needed to
big one the big one tall one ah bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish balik err for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
dia rajin gila ah ya but good lah know he he he he invests on that lah he invests on that then to have like
then apa tu force vomit pun tengah record
ah then recently dia cakap last week eh last week dia cakap dia record dikir barat
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this ranggi ranggi guys ah ranggi is the motorcycle macam
ah so ranggi is actually macam um
ranggi is err some of them ada budak-budak dikir barat ah
so I think dorang
abeh hakim is a buat sounds pe
so dia macam pergi dekat dia lah but then banyak lah then it's like side bazaar bush man dia punya side project
adib I think adib playing bass err then got err um restam bushman main guitar then err rizal rizal dulu main sound of province rizal main sound of province dulu
rizal kecil
he covered ah session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer lah then dia main for this band aku tak tahu siapa lagi a few more guys ah like play for his band
so dorang macam rerecord balik ah ya
um but then financially maybe tak sangat lah
tu lah
tu pasal lah tak aku cakap dengan zad juga zad dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh then tiba-tiba macam korang main semua cakap zad kau nak pakai pakai ah kau nak pakai pakai ah eh tak boleh ah kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah ah pakai jer it's a wear and tear thing
aku tahu dia mahal but then I'm giving you that that green light apa that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay ah understand sometimes people don't want to terhutang budi kau tahu
tak maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe dulu dia pernah macam have this friend who like okay just use ah then after that after using already then like eh wah now I want to you never give me back macam you know
jialat ah jialat got friend ah but then tak tahu ah but I'm okay ah kalau zad nak pinjam
dah ah
tapi end of the day also all the stuff macam like it's a wear and tear punya benda pe so
tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah eh you also broken what it'll also break what like know like so it's okay lah I mean the thing is
ya that's why kesian sia I know he's been macam dia berbual dengan aku ah like cannot wait sia I cannot wait to play drums sia
ah I cannot wait to lepak I cannot wait to record you know I told him lah if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us lah we can help you set up the mic setting ah
like I know he don't want to terhutang budi that's confirm and maybe his style is different dia takut macam dia
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold eh macam don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt what hurt the feeling hurt what so I don't think he's like that
but kita dah cakap ah I mean I already told him also eh kalau kau need to record you need help you just call us lah ah we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you ah cause you is is is you are the one doing the work
we here just to help lepak
sekarang mesti dia rabak gila seh dekat rumah tapi tengok ah
no but the thing is this type of thing right the walk right you cannot pikiran you know just go regret lepas tu ah regret after that ah but there's no regret ah I mean for me personally when I went err the walk was was rabak ah the starting was fun cause everything but
no but she also was struggling ah cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like eh guys guys sekejap sekejap sekejap stop stop stop aku tak boleh aku tak boleh ah so we actually sat down and azil macam okay no problem no problem duduk
then it was like matahari dekat mata the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then kita macam eh kita rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we lek sekejap lek sekejap
rabak ah for me ah personally but I told them sorry ah I say paiseh paiseh ah like we have to have a lot of stops
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle ah ah so we did manage to finish ah so the moment we touch that thing right kita cakap kita sampai right
macam macam azil we made it ah we just high five sia
eh take photo take photo take photo lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan I lie down already sia I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks azil take out socks take out shoes aisyah also sit down then all termenung already like good twenty minutes
eh hafiz fetching ah jalan to the punggol settlement there is like another one click ah
one point five click ah betul
rabak ah
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already ah like oh dah penat ah dah penat ah dah penat ah mata dah rabak I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also malas you know like want to minum air just drink water ah drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually hamimah zafran all they wake already they wanted to go makan
ya lah breakfast but cause aisyah ah hafiz fetching aisyah mah so they wanted to go makan then they ask you and nazril kau dengan nazril plan ah nak pergi makan mana then kita jumpa somewhere tu aku cakap eh tak boleh ah
kita nak balik tidur balik tidur ah nak balik tidur
so hafiz fetch us fetch actually wanted to fetch fetch aisyah then we wanted to grab home then hafiz cakap eh tak apa ah aku hantar korang ah
dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari toilet aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah slow gila then aku duduk aku duduk macam eh sia ah to go into the car also macam eh sia ah rabak sia ni
ah apa oh ya ya cause coastal
twenty one eh like like almost twenty clicks ah actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way err hud told me is about twenty five clicks ye
tak but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
that sengkang we thought you is after that bridge thought the sengkang is already punggol sekali eh bukan it's another sengkang
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector dia macam sampai dekat red bridge tau but this one is before red bridge kau dah belok kiri
mm tengok yang last sekali
mm nasi ayam
sustenance wise memang boleh lah tapi kalau fikir sangat pasal
the taste I think can be very boring cepat muak as well
hmm I don't really like mee kuning
boleh lah
peliknya ah do
and I tak faham dia cakap pasal apa
steamboat macam dekat
ada wire
itu lah kalau lama-lama nanti sesak hidung mm
mm ya good first time lah tak pernah try mala
tetapi kan
pun boleh kata macam muak juga lah
tak boleh lama-lama sangat lah makan
tetapi ini sedap lah
rasa sikit-sikit kan
ya so kalau private they
dah bagi timing lah nak datang hari apa and at what time
oh macam acid reflux ah
I kena malam itu just berapa like a few nights ago ugh
lepas itu nak kena bangun pagi untuk kelas like pukul lapan or
mm nak
tetapi kan takkan setakat nak beli satu sahaja tempat
so macam child best situation ah
err I think season four baru nak masuk
dia buat makeup dia macam itu ke
but I feel macam
I mean memang ah it's a show but it's too overplayed
macam terlalu drama lah
I know dan is jadi gossip girl tetapi macam tak make sense eh story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
story kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku
mm sebab boleh nampak mm
dia macam he in one scene dia pun terjekut he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so dia texting diri dia sendiri lah kan
tetapi kan kalau
kalau theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl boleh masuk akal
ya or macam
ya and the fact that dia dapat marry serena pun macam err
serena and then he talk trash about her dekat gossip girl
mm raccoon lah bapa dia pun sama jer
tetapi wait dia punya part
part rambut itu
no lah dia punya hairstyle dia kadang-kadang macam tak match
eh dia dalam cerita star trek
oh bukan eh
uh siapa baru give birth tak eh
oh bukan bukan dah lama dah
apa seh
I mean I'm saving up all the cerita for after exams
mm tengah belajar
so nak kena make sure lah
kena make sure betul-betul nak yes
macam interesting jer
psychology is something you can take on tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa
time duit and betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja
uh well selalunya orang cakap two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
but tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil
ada duit ada time tapi kalau tak ada dedication macam buang masa
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you ada lah these three
perangai melayu yes
ya lah fikir pasal duit lah sekarang memang okay
but kalau nak ambil one more
and kalau
personal betul
why kenapa
tetapi kan ambil lesen
nak fikir pasal sekolah so kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena divide
exciting itu memang lah but sekarang I pun tak ada kereta
ya tetapi kalau tak ada macam
kalau tak ada use for kereta
macam waste of time itu sahaja
ya lah I sudah biasa sangat naik public transport
yes yang pasal the drawing mm yes
it's like an accomplishment dalam hidup
not seven wonders ke
I think so wah kaabah sendiri pun tak tahu
okay so america then europe tak ada tempat lain dah ke
apa try studying
tapi itu lah
change starts with you so kalau nak start saving
mm you know boleh is very forgiving

orang melayu cakap um jangan apa
most of the job dia orang cakap aiya it's like contract it's not really ah

atau system analyst ah
kena twenty four seven support
it's like like to me not much difference right kalau work from home then
I think python macam python for me is okay lah because it's a
actually high level is the the code that macam can be readable kan so kalau macam if a human being baca the code
ah there's this code thing called fortran right betul tak
then what ni apa this there's this language namanya C hash eh apa C hash eh is it
but it's um the pace is what like dia ikut which um which language
I don't really like to like build you know macam build all the app
ingat tak um during the year twenty
my job mostly like ah then investigate ah gitu
ah error error dia akan email kan so times ten kan times ten
like macam need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
like enriching to do this kind of work but yang tak suka is the I really benci is support twenty four seven on the phone ah
the like not say down time ah macam
nenek boleh pergi balik ah nenek
um I think tak boleh ah but eh but dia right yang syakilah iman is maybe ah I think
eh I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think berlambak ah mail dia

then dah you all dah makan belum
semua tengah tidur kan
tak dia punya ingredients kan beli kat pasar atau uh
you mean the ikan is the the one that is boneless eh
um mesti
ya the sauce right then pour on top kan just just tuang
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make ah macam mix and match
apa apa ya like
tomato semua ah tomato um pineapple
ah capsicum sedap I like I like the capsicum
the yang makan masa ah kan
for for us actually if let's say our our family kan macam nak ada maid kan
kalau siapa dah kahwin kan atau like we have our own house kan maybe separate ah let's say I
no I mean like one maid ah because like the maid tak payah just stay at one house do all the work what because sometimes mak ada nenek ada kan so maybe can
the maid is okay then we we must bayar for the transport
and maybe give them time off ah kan kalau
tak complain atau tak
feel macam pressure kan we we like they call it give and take ah
don't over over work the maid lah kalau maid is okay then okay what you know
this one maybe we can plan ten ah next time because bapak kan dah tua<malay kan nanti mak
like at least like the maid boleh masakkan actually the best kan the maid masak
right because if the maid masak right then we just need to buy the stuff ah then sekarang
tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh just order online kan
but any online pasar or not macam pasar food eh buy meat or chicken ada eh
but I mean like the betul punya pasar online maybe maybe
no because fairprice jual beef tak eh because beef is very hard to find right
um macam mana the person tahu
oh no oh but means the device kan then the the user mesti jalan to
our our house all small what america everything is so big kan I mean america everything you see dia punya rumah besar-besar or I think european some also the house big kan
but the device is uh quite mahal kan I think thousands right
so seven days tak payah pergi kerja ah just somewhere else ah
itu hari cakap open the ikea but oh but now open lah
so nobody can meet their friends to eat what so they just have to eat cepat-cepat makan then then just balik class ah
but that that time weird you know ah dekat mana eh
apa nama kedai dia yang mister you you know orchid house dekat serangoon gardens tu
orchid house the the indian food macam mamak ah
mamak food
al-azhar gitu those kind macam woodgrove gitu ah
phase the first week of phase two kan atau I think I jumpa my friend during the phase two second week ah kan
phase two is about nineteen june kan so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend makan dekat tu ah orchid house
pelik ke so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird ah kan
mesti customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else kan because
because of the apa seating arrangement
and some people they apa like they in a group kan say eight people ah four four kan
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then bersembang lah dengan kawan-kawan kan
um I heard the store owner kan atau business owner dia orang call the
but sometimes we think oh it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you tengok news
eh but do do you think it's possible kan kalau dia orang make a system kan means by far away then they auto checkout
ah if the person off then tak boleh ah kan
ya the the app apa what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
it's good kan macam but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
actually that one bagus tau pasal you like eh hey google then the you can play spotify
K because my my friend he dia pakai google home eh google phone tau so I use apple ah but the that time I stay punggol also share with him kan
so he use the the what google assistance eh yang cakap the voice ah
dia cakap even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
ah macam macam mana nak tahu ah
no I mean macam mana nak nak tahu that whether they are listening to you or not
no I think if let's say oh but I think google kan macam mana eh if you like ask question kan like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say um oh sorry we cannot
something basic ah like uh what time is it maybe dia tahu ah kalau tanya something like um
my friend eh my friend singaporean kan but then he dia study full time dekat pergi luar ah
then dia punya apartment kan
then dia pun ada alexa I think now alexa better ah because
I think that one bukan maybe that one is it thailand something ah I cannot remember
ah the ah the dekat mana eh ah this place ah that time I went interview tanjong pagar go it's called what guoco tower ah
so when you tap kan dia dia tahu which which place to go to ah like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down what
macam main bawah blok sia tu bro
eh anyway sekarang david moyes kat mana siol
oh dia sekarang manage west ham oh west ham eh ah how did west ham do in their oh they lost against new castle
and you know we we've got these we've got these dia macam kau macam you just look at this guy
and you're like okay dah settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
so that's why mourinho selalunya dia nya team err their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
klopp and mourinho ni macam dorang macam opposite sides of the spectrum ah in a way ah
apa swan eh swan swan and harry kane
sun sun ke swan
okay ya lah I mean it's like it's like championship manager ah right oh no no best is the best is like FIFA what am I saying okay okay sorry sorry aku dah lupa defence ni apa
how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone aku
okay lah takpe lah anyway ah I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing ah cause you know I've just uh
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so pada aku macam
I I like what Netflix does these days eh dorang ada macam ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
sial lah bro that one macam for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
kau zuleika zulkifli actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
tell all documentary ah an anelka and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything macam basically
aku rasa nama dia macam gitu ah I mean he's muslim name is supposedly bilal but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
like one was the the france punya
and macam pada anelka it was not fair ah like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
okay so so so basically macam I've watched cobra kai I've watched err I mean I don't tend to watch the series ah I would watch like documentaries or macam movies ah so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting ah
err social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now uh it's about how macam Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants kan dorang basically
dorang tahu like what attracts you what what you're interested in uh
so dorang buat macam uh and if not an avatar they like what do you call it lah
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like macam they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why macam Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
sia ah why do they think this way sia asal dorang fikir macam gitu like dia
kau how can people just support sia macam tak masuk akal but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya lah usually it's either very insidious thingy ah
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like macam lost his faith a bit lah cause one of the themes of the movie
after he has a son of his own he starts to macam go back to
like worshipping god ah no macam macam it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like macam ya lah orang beragama pun macam
kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu that sort of thing so macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang for like five years lepas tu dia macam eh astgahfirullah aku kena qadak balik solat aku
ya so so so that's a tragedy macam something happens and then after that he he has this macam love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like macam ah
you know that twilight fella lah huh ya the glittery vampire so dia yang sekarang
okay shouldn't stereotype err pastor dorang
okay lah so it's an lah it's not the Android box yang Android box yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada kan tu benda kan
no he was in house of cards and and err house of cards the final season just macam tergantung macam gitu apa
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang cause of all the
religious upbringing to say like eh ni benda salah sia what am I doing you know that sort of thing so macam I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no lah no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like macam it won't have been like once every few months ah which is the situation you find it you find now ah
dia panggil kau sir but asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau seh
check it out I I was wrong okay lah I mean I think I can tell this to the camera eh to the camera pula to the recorder okay I was from serangoon right
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like ini aizat adam ni semua like eh ya eh eh you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school dulu
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude lah but but macam
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many uh malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese lah macam you won't find a malay chap in the in that class ah
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times nanti aku google aku check kan lepas tu aku aku aku forward dekat kau lah
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that uh inhibits our society ah but basically ya lah back to what we were saying macam aku rasa that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference apa betul tak like
ya macam one thing about us mungkin err compared to kita punya parents eh macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita tend to macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita you know like our parents aku rasa dorangnya generations is like kau kenal ni satu perempuan
within a few months tunang another few months kahwin you know that sort of thing
what was that so so so you see eh macam what ondre said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different ah you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case ah macam like oh it was a norm ah like oh your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants ah you know so macam like
orang pakistan kat sini will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now ah so maybe kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa then talk talk talk eh I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing ah macam it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to ah but of course I mean
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that macam err syed ahmad was interested in your mother
um okay so what was that okay so basically macam ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing ah so macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir sia eh anak aku
I think girls these days they are like lagi beza dari kita macam in the sense that they are really pressured to
susceptible to this ah macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa in a way lah but aku rasa untuk wanita ni
dorang lebih senang dipengaruh ah pada aku ah ah like compared to guys ah macam I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife macam
ah kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah you know that sort of thinking you know
where they provide a place for you to do the walimah kan
a still somewhat rare for the whole majlis from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like masjid mawaddah
no but bartley is like macam bartley is is is so called not really
I'm trying to say is that macam nowadays you have instances where people do say like eh should we have our majlis in a mosque cause then like orang nak sembahyang and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like macam it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding what you know in a way lah but of course
pada aku pun aku rasa macam if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a walimah a small walimah outside the mosque ah
okay ah not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam that was
something that that was on her mind like macam eh why are we doing it in the mosque abeh macam like oh I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but pada aku macam like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
eh why you buying a three room flat sia it's so macam aku rasa macam I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure ah I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning ah
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way macam at the end of the day you just have to be
ya huh ya ya aku dah end of this month eh end of this month eh end of this year dah enam tahun
aku fikir aku nak upgrade to macam five room ke ah
sengkang juga
bro bro tampines mahal bro tampines mahal gila no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so tak ah tu abbas nya parents aku sengkang apa
basically basically okay basically basically sengkang right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale lah so for those people who don't know sengkang you know is divided into this so called macam four districts gitu lah so err anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this sungai lah
it's called the sungai punggol I think ah so like if you look out my window here you can see the sungai ah
so that sungai punggol err is the boundary between sengkang which is held by the workers' party and ang mo kio which is held by pinky work
you should talk to my cousin abbas ah who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me eh kalau kau suka breaking bad kau kena watch this better call saul lah
so aku macam aku ada tengok ah like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while aku macam how many seasons are there oh my god breaking bad only has five seasons
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where abang dia yang very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
okay I I think roughly around at that point aku dah macam
kan there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle dia macam terus didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya lah but he kept on macam like downplaying si jimmy nya achievement ah dia macam cakap you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing kan
and the witcher ke apa witcher witcher pun aku tak tengok sangat
eh prison break si dia tu dah mati kan the actual dah mati kan the guy who plays michael scofield lah
okay let me google this michael scofield mati
so is season five good or not dorang ada tulis prison break season six lagi tak ah
the movie was not on the ni ni kan the movie was on siapa eh only the final break
shucks ah ikram stop getting me hooked back on all this crap lah malas sial nak pergi tengok ni semua
oh my god stop sia kau
aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh once I see macam satu benda ni ada four five seasons kan
aku terus lemah ah aku macam no lah I cannot watch this sia
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass punya app
mine is after iPhone eight lah basically boleh ah so so so it's one of those things that I don't know ah Apple fan boys are talking about these days ah
double double tap then the code keluar
the scanner the scanner the scanner keluar not the code the camera thingy ya
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code ah macam ni kau tengok ayatul kursi
no no no that's that's if you can lah kat bawah tu kan
then it goes ayatul kursi
there kat bawah kat bawah sini
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this dia macam go
so uh inshallah with ah I also reciting ayatul kursi we will get our twenty dollars and err we can spend it on a steak later at jalan kayu
shall we talk about our favourite makan places since it's almost lunch
tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana ah
tapi I've never heard of it being described as a good place lah
babe aku pun aku pun I know I know err anchorvale
dorang ada the vending machine cafe ah if that's what you are referring to
the yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung
yes so yassin kampung they have this off shoot called lepak one corner
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot lepak one corner it it doesn't feel like the lepak place ah it feels like you just go in kau beli makan dekat no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
okay ya good joke but ah so then macam apa tau dia macam tempat makan dia eh dia macam okay kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam queue up dekat the stall ah so it's like a hawker stall ah it's like a hawker centre
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like abeh kau kena pergi sana order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that makanan dia okay lah not bad lah but pada aku macam so so juga but it doesn't have the lepak feeling lah
because like pada aku lepak feeling macam kau kau duduk then like eh bhai teh tarik lagi satu ah eh if you want to go place you should go to mahamoodiya
yes the one next to the Shell eh dorang dah up market sia
then aku realise
mahal sia it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the apa last week of the year what
kan then aku tak tahu macam mana like we need to have more options I guess
but unless we go for the apa ah smaller rooms ah
that one untuk yang the suite room so aku rasa macam besar sangat I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
aku rasa boleh ah but I think it's about dalam empat ratus gitu
aku rasa ah
ya I think aku rasa for now empat orang but
the price confirm makin mahal
botanic gardens theme ah the boy bunga theme
oh ya dia belum decide right
prime is hard to find you know there's only like berapa jer dalam singapore ni tau nak cari
kipas oh it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know sebelah-sebelah leh like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
ya bodoh so big sia
ya so what is just the four of us ah xing jing oh no with the others right because we doing dinner dengan yang lain-lain kan malam so
kau plan lah then kau bilang kita then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
ya they bodoh
this is christmas so tak payah lohei
I think dinenr can go all out lah I guess not all out as in macam terus
apa sakan ah but more like a
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve lah I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the makanan will dia ada server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
he kena bullied
what what do you mean location kena change you mean the buffet town run away or what
for the dinner dia orang boleh eh
um terrence I haven't check with him yet tapi aku rasa maybe dia tak boleh because that week he's going back to school already
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least macam tujuh puluh percent untuk
dia orang go to phase three lah so
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members lah yang tinggal dalam serumah right
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas punya dinner kan
so aku tak tahu ah macam mana like
bo pian lah kan macam tak boleh apa
I mean technically it's not even a macam public holiday on that day right
I think he never go there before so you should be safe dia tak ada benchmark untuk tempat tu
then the next morning he will aku rasa go to the work straight
so the tuesday morning aku rasa he has to go back to work lor
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday punya time slot I mean err rates ya
masih ah kau taiwan
ya it was that one I go on march it was macam sejuk ah tapi macam just like aircon kind yes
the he say macam apa like
he's not going they are not going to macam vaccinate everybody kat singapore
tak tahu save duit agaknya
apa purpose kan I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat they can just spread to each other lah
oh cactus cactus yang kecil-kecil gitu eh then
dua cactus
no the normal cactus yang besar dia ada thorns then macam bulat-bulat gitu and dia punya shape
straight then bulat-bulat eh right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
kau siak ah hey mahal pokok tu
kau tanam pokok durian jer lah
the experts say lah the lockdown causes more macam apa problems than benefits ya
macam dulu dia tak pakai grab but sekali now oh I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it lah rather than kau tahu macam kalau tak ada COVID like everybody is still
macam oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay lah aku rasa
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money untuk
aku rasa okay lah
bagus lah kan macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef kat rumah kan semua buat dalgona coffee macam kau
you will just stuck at home with your family lah you got no choice but just to interact dengan dia orang like
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like kalau kau baca that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
then aku rasa like I think they dia orang tak concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
I mean during the even like dia punya apa
so they don't really care about that part aku tak tahu but
it just go without the track what sia bodoh
iya lah confirm ada lah
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then macam suddenly kau dalam hutan tu kau introduce monyet kau introduce pangolin kau introduce lemur pelanduk I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya ni bukan library tau kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil tau
so they have to kill or macam that one lah like what chicken flu like that eh bird flu chicken flu
sekali coronavirus from plants leh
kau masih tau
I only need to buy one plant untuk taruh dalam office aku
but actually mati a very terrible death to do
ya sia kau teruk sia
then we got scraping benda tu
aiya the typical kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu
dia macam coconut tree but it's not
what is it called eh yang
it's not coconut tree yang pokok-pokok yang
fern gitu is it look like a fern
tak lah serious
ya usually events that kind of pokok lah you know like those
standard pokok I don't know
it's the typical pokok at events you know
yes that's one thing pokok pisang
the youngest means macam early twenties twenty two ah wow I feel old now
you got listen to misteri jam dua belas or not
huh tak ah aku tak berani I mean aku takut kena kacau sekali tu aku dah takut ya eh I think I told you right that time then ya I was studying at home I think I was twelve ah I was studying at home right then the the
eh you let's listen together no no I add sound effects what the hell I mean you know my place my areas sana banyak keras kan shit lah
dulu eh kau tinggal situ
wait your house is dekat fuchun fuchun primary baru ke fuchun primary lama is it near marsiling primary
ya ya ya ya I know mm you know what is keras right one look you know that is keras
I I only went to the old fuchun for apa tu for uh orientation I was like my first year in my primary school because but my first my first uh my first year in primary school was at the new one it's just that when I orientation it was at the old one
I don't know but I remember I think I think your parents apply for primary school then they give you like macam mana I think you bid when I think it's bidding right is it by bidding or something no I think for uh apa tu pun sama kan uh the kindergarten I think because my sister she did the same thing I think she bid for placement
so it's not enough place they'll put you another place ya they said fuchun was uh one of the best primary schools there a lot produces a lot of uh apa they say a lot of high scorpions and which is true ah
old uh old fuchun was haunted new fuchun was okay lah I mean it was not as keras
like apa evergreen they didn't have like brownies it was red cross or then there was then I was like mm okay lah red cross sounds like similar sekali I join aku join
I mean it wasn't hard I mean I join I enjoyed it it was just different because brownies was like uh buy my cookies you know like uh uh was an elf or like a pixie you know then you will learn how to cook learn how to sew but brownie was like was really like you know footdrills ya they really make sure you do so like you're you know you like ya because you had to do evacuation and things like that first aid my specialty was red cross knowledge history basically like the history we learn we had to learn about apa tu the founder lah things like that apa tu
I only had apa eh
kesian got try got try
masak we we learnt how to not really it's like nutrition is a bit like like like nutrition ah like our current nutrition class it's just that was more they they need more hands on cooking
had to cook ya I had to put during fasting month batal sia legit terbatal puasa aku I was like unconsciously I was like hmm rasa masin tak shit ya I was like ya oh my god oh no then I was like am I supposed to spit it out my friends was like ah batal jer lah then I was like alahai shit lah tak sengaja then ya you can okay lah I mean I felt guilty for like I was like okay lah batal batal lah it's fine I ganti anyways
err like basically musical theory then they taught us to play recorder pianica entah
I was in charge of the gong but it's like apa tu
but I was late once and they had to switch me over or something then I change it's like ya the drum is like I forgot what's the name of the instrument but it's like one side is smaller one side is bigger then ya I wanted to use the kompang kompang you know or the or the small one no not rebana it's the it's the long one then it's like it's the you know you know apa tu
err pontianak harum sundal malam you know the long one the metal with the round thing at the top ya then ya I wanted to play that that's a part of gamelan gamelan is the name of the whole thing what orchestra bukan xylophone panjang-panjang wait ya it's something like xylophone lah ah bulat-bulat
ya lah I had to uh I had to masuk gamelan play guitar piano had to learn piano apa tu ha they made us dance they made us fusion dance then uh contempt I was like oh my god do I look like I can dance hmm
I'm more of a musician ha me is not uh apa tu dancer you know saya bukan penari ya I was like okay ah apa tu then for sports we had to learn floorball in primary school floorball
then apa tu
played a lot lah we played a lot I was good at sports but when you know you had to run around like run around the field you know to warm up I'm like orh tak nak tak nak tak nak then it's like
qiam jer
ya it was rumah orang kan
buat bodoh jer
primary five then secondary school sec two you know always they had the night walks right it was at the you know those really old camps did you watch okay you watched incredible tales right you saw yang you know about the the the the
kena like kena jalan lah macam dia orang tarukkan glow stick kan lepas tu
dia orang apa tu dia orang bagi kau jalan dengan the first person kena pegang dia punya torchlight then yang belakang tu you know then macam kena taruk tangan atas bahu
caterpillar gitu ha I was usually either the first or the last one because I wasn't scared you know I'm not scared lah so but the weirdest thing you at what for some reason once kan what happened was aku tengah like everything was okay like it it started out fine
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite lah so basically after the uh night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then tepuk ah something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
but the what weird like apa tu
benda yang pelik yang terjadi kan actually selepas tu
like so basically kan like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle kan so yang dia punya faci dia kan the eh no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut lah because I was injured right so they uh they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we sampai dia punya campsite kan
I don't know they they they were getting ready to eat apa tu supper eh ya then they showered already then one of my friends like err apa tu where where did you go lah right why you said I thought you take shortcut oh why you take so long ah I'm uh then aku macam
aku tak tahu sia
I don't know I don't know it didn't feel very long it felt like it was short but the problem is when we reach everyone was either showered or the last few are showering you know that kan so you can you think do you like people shower you you get the girls and all lama juga lah kan ha lama juga so I was oh my god until now I can't figure out what happened but ya
it's near a madrasah also right
why would you put your kubur there tanah ah
kampung sia what I'm weird is one thing that is that in the hustle and bustle of the city
macam kampung pula kan
no I think they know because I went to search up on you know where to visit you know we we always do those visits right and I was searching where to visit ah then I saw this one place they said kubur melayu tengah-tengahnya apa tu kat bugis juga I think
like beside that's why when the moment you said oh kat bugis right then I was like is it near the near the madrasah and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous lah I mean who would think
kan I mean the only time I experienced that was that time kampung lah
aku nak pergi surau because I used to I used to stay over at my pakcik's house right and
my pakcik and makcik orang malaysia right orang malaysia kau tau lah rumah dia orang kat kampung-kampung kan so one one of the kampung is kalau nak daripada surau dah habis solat nak kena jalan balik tu kena lalu kubur
okay lah okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you pergi surau you won't go alone what especially because I budak singapore kan mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana especially because malaysia you know ah there's a lot of those cases right so
banyak ah bukan culik jer habis
so it's like I mean seram is seram but yang paling seram is one of my uncle's house dekat ni jalan tan kee it's kat eh but I think they move ah already it was damn dilapidated
it's like the area was macam it was how to say ah they want to
pecahkan they want to pecahkan and nak buat rumah baru but it's like dia orang tak nak move because they were miskin kan so it's like apa tu
like as a kid I was like entah I don't know but it smelt really bad so as a kid you know biasa lah you know very particular right so tak nak tak nak masuk tunggu dalam van but we me and my cousin got stuck in the van the lock rosak ya they had to send it to a kedai to get it fixed but anyways lah so basically it's like you know it's the really old kampung type like you want shower right must go out ya it's under the pokok then my mum was like when I was showering with my mum my mum was like jangan tengok atas
pokok kekabu weh
no it's open air it's zinc oak lah it's just a zinc panels sebelah kiri kanan habis you know it's the dia punya tempat air dia orang simpan air kat tempayan you know those
ya it's like you know those kimchi kimchi jars yes they put water in it dah rupa baldi tau habis dah lah air sejuk
aku nangis sumpah aku tak berani aku tak berani pergi toilet sorang-sorang tau aku kalau pergi toilet masa kat kampung ibu ibu pergi ibu pergi lah sorang ibu no I'm not going to go alone toilet dah lah kat luar tengah-tengah malam masa tu nak shower sorang-sorang you know you imagine my family from singapore all the way to all the way to malaysia kan then you take bath all the way then melekit kalau tak tak nak solat lagi
ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone oh my god dah lah masa tu tengah ada case apa tu you know they masa that one is early two thousand still got case of apa tu orang minyak ke apa kan something like that
pengamal pengamal they they they practise like magic no they amal it like
you you know how some you know how some people buang dia orang punya pad darah dia orang kan dia orang nak lawa kan dia orang nanti ambil dia orang baca-baca dia orang ambil dia orang punya darah uzur tu dia orang taruk kat muka dia orang baca-baca that's how lah dia orang amal lah macam orang ya because like you know how they simpan jin simpannya hantu raya simpannya simpannya cik kak kan apa
balik kampung no
no I don't know I don't know eh I think I don't know eh is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between langsuir and pontianak
oh yang nenek tu eh
bomoh eh
is it the makcik bomoh that one that episode
ya the one that the guy potong kuku malam-malam then the guy the other guy bukanya payung dalam rumah kan ya ya why what's your question
apa apa no penanggal penanggal lain do you realise it's the same thing because nananggal is the philippines term for penanggal penanggal is melayu
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy kan philippines indonesia melayu orang orang singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that aiya anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore lah
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's pontianak you were saying
oh one of the one of the oh it wasn't in the it wasn't in the oh ya ya ya ya ya the penanggal yang takde so basically the apa tu the organs that one right ya it's not a joke my dad used to oh ya you know I I did the interview right so basically uh for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know zaman dulu is yang apa tu tali dia hanging kan kat atas it wasn't underground like now kan ya so basically singapore ha kat kat malaysia tak lah kat singapore lah so basically like apa tu they had to change dia punya lines kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia uh telephone lama dia orang kan rosak then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was ah it's technician ah electric punya technician so basically what happened was that you know if you tukar senja-senja you'll see sometimes the penanggal head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say eh penanggal is not really macam it's not like hantu raya it's not like pontianak it's not dead oh it's practice they say eh they pengamal they like orang minyak kan amal black magic so it's like apa tu
ha they practise ah but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know err orang minyak is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something aku tak ingat right no no no he made a made a perjanjian dengan syaitan then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery sia plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not bomoh lah but you work with syaitan right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
entah lah suka hati kau lah nak
oh dia nak makan anak dia I think
oh awet muda
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get uh malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their tingkap
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow ah they say that err they put because they are this one jin or ghost kan hantu kan that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same jin that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the rahim they they eat the janin right they that's why they say what zaman dulu maghrib jer tutup tingkap then they then they will hang like paku-paku atau punya apa tu
garam kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason garam is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad pagar rumah or not but ya
ya they say what is it ah what what daun apa also not ketumbar but they say LOL ketumbar untuk makan there's one daun they use to like apa tu
I don't know what's the name of the daun but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like apa tu uh
anasir-anasir sihir or something like that
they said they use it for kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke they use the daun or something I don't remember this one daun they even sell sabun or like sabun because who want to buy daun and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as tanah liat you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the jins are quite chicken sia I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who sambut the baby
I mean like I said lah the the the jin we were talking about this it eats uh it steals babies and things like that that's why they say what actually the the reason behind oh need to go back inside the house uh uh sebelum maghrib right
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then sekali got extra nurse the one that sambut your baby oh no oh my god hell no because my mum says that it's very keras lah that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things what everywhere got things what even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like oh they talking about me
ugh two bad you don't you don't go to camp sia but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya tidur mati ah ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind lah I wear specs lah but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau that's why
baca ke tak baca it won't stop me from getting disturbed
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the syarahan-syarahan they say actually jin can apa tu manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
I think rather than hasutan right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake what ya so basically it's not exactly hasutan but it's more of because hasutan are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see err like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say what apa eh iman kuat or semangat kuat or something right then they said that apa tu
oh so since like this person semangat kuat akan disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister lemah semangat kan so dia kena kacau instead of my father
because my kakak penakut I think no wonder anak dia pun ikut lah pergi toilet pun bushu can you open the light for me mother never open the door please lah how old already you put switch on the light lah your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I kena tap before
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet lah whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me ha I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like oh my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just khayal like if it's like uh you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this one is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
ustaz say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
oh my god have you seen the the penampakan like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
I honestly feel that K lah the one that I I I I'm a sceptic lah like you if you post on macam kan dia orang buka dia orang macam tunjuk kan
dia orang nak views kot
I feel like I I believe more those yang macam amateur amateur ones that macam a that one scares me for real like I saw one kan and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's ada show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still kampung kot
maybe dia orang tak no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my nenek ada saka kan
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have saka
I I like it's hard to find people with susuk in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers kan it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody bomoh ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find bomoh bomoh pun uh wah golden golden apa tu
uh apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda LOL what
so leceh
for susuk or like if you jaga like if you ada saka ke apa kan kena jaga lama seh ha kain kuning lah pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor so apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh
I don't know I don't know I don't have susuk I don't have saka buluh kot buluh
eh tak lah payung
I don't know I think buluh has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said daun or air garam maybe like buluh has some
dia docker ke apa metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's galah galah galah galah metal kat dalam rumah apa kalau metal kat dalam rumah apa you need to walk under the galah
but why would you walk under the galah when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the galah if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
I guess but then again if you do susuk probably you won't you will be more aware lah I mean zaman sekarang I wouldn't know lah tengah main handphone alamak jalan bawah galah bodoh apa the heck but ya
kau ingat kau ingat burger ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out terkeluar right you because ah you become uglier
that's what they say if your your susuk keluar you become buruk
cerita hantu eh
macam botox ah it's just that botox is err it stays inside your skin
I guess so can you imagine your bomoh dies then you're you're you are no lah eh but then
nazak right I think that's I think that's common ah
so you suffer more when you die ah macam saka ah
you cannot die tenteram
they say when they leave you to put inside your kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you kafan you they they can feel them showering you things like that
it's like pakai baju biasa ah eh please lah you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers kafan won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like alah asal dia orang tak taruk banyak cloth bodoh sejuk siol bajet ke satu layer jer tu lah pasal tapi eh dia orang kafan sampai tu apa
kain kafan all the way apa guess you have stockings
kain batik just to cover your atas jer but your kafan is all white ah
it's just to cover the face so people don't macam stare at you or something it's just macam you okay if like you eat nasi lemak will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the sayur all what
mayat jijik ah no but there are cases if you know right when allah tak nak terima your death kan then you apa ada the maggots or like ular atau apa tu nanah
it will push you back out or like your kubur will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
dia duduk balik is it
they just I I the one that I know is jangan when they say terima tak or whatever ambil beban ke apa don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
biar allah ambil beban
or may allah take your syaitan
during nazak a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the bumbung you know zinc kampung right so they use zinc punya bumbung kan so for like when the person tengah nazak kan dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar
kau ingat kau kau ingat convertible ke apa they had to climb and open it lah kau ni bodoh but ya lah they have to open the zinc bumbung then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves ah because I think I I don't know if you saw yang jangan pandang belakang they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy terima nenek dia punya benda tu I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum cakap the thing
he's recording sia the thing apa tu
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a saka
I don't have a saka I'm a sucker but I don't have a saka you get me but ya it's like um
don't have worldly desires tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat uh apa tu
basic willing to help people gitu ah sincere lah so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my pakcik makcik and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum wow she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work
ya because zaman tu right zaman tu perempuan kena cuci rumah and masak
okay abang so how our renovation plans
hari raya wah you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate hari raya yet
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate hari raya
why are we talking about hari raya
so nanti I pergi um
nanti I pergi Popular I beli cardboard
I beli kertas yang keras tu then uh I
cari gambar nanti I print
nanti I cetak nanti I print lepas tu nanti boleh tampal lah dekat cardboard itu
tak lah itu itu kena tunggu nanti nanti bila jumpa dengan dia punya
apa designer itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita just um
kita just baca-baca jer tak tahu betul ke tak ke kan
buat lawak ah
kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang company err company itu nak apa nak
tunjuk kita nak bagi kita kan jadi
jadi kita just
kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi jer lah letak kat dalam mood board itu
hari itu I dah tunjuk you gambar dekat WhatsApp dah tengok belum
ha ya lah habis group mana
corak oh okay ah if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
betul juga uh uh eh paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua uh apa itu
uh almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu
orang yang uh cucikan sofa
sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu actually dari daripada minyak masak
lepas itu uh yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat uh platform itu
yang yang dulu actually nak buat musollah lepas itu tak jadi
sebenarnya bukan nak hack nak nak buang uh yang lama punya platform sebab
sebab platform itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput
tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput lah itu dah nak err dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang
lepas itu bawah platform itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak
uh huh buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak vinyl dulu kan lepas itu nanti dah ada
letak vinyl dan kalau ada budget then baru boleh tambah platform
okay tak apa itu nanti
that one I that one that idea came from tak I nampak hari itu my friend dia tengah buat renovation sekarang
lepas itu dia upload dekat uh story
lepas itu dia pakai glass itu ah um dia pun ada that same same sama punya segi balcony lepas itu dia
ah dia dia yang dia yang I nampak daripada story dia lah yang dia pakai glass itu kalau tidak I pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak replace that that tingkap dengan
dengan apa so idea dia datang itu lah I ternampak story my friend
dia ada tag hari itu tapi I tak ingat ada dia ada tag uh
dia dia popular juga apa eh nama dia eh tak ingat ah
ya habis sekarang I scolding ah everytime they upload video
ah nanti I pergi intai dia punya video tengok apa progress cari idea
abang you boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada you tolong scolding kan ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah I
I kan tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya uh tingkap cantik
dia satu yang dia pakai yang uh sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya uh yang macam ketat
uh ketat punya macam mana nak cakap eh yang ada yang ada handle eh
ah tapi cantik dia macam simple saja tapi cantik
tapi masalahnya sekarang sliding pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun
tak lah tingkap okay actually dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari supplier sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah lah
ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah already yang kan sudah
dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat tau dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja I bila kat dapur baru bunyi
sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar you tak bunuh dia sebab itu I cakap kena panggil
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot lah I cannot tahan already is
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like merajuk
you tahu macam merajuk perempuan ah okay lah okay lah apa
saya tipu lah saya tipu lah okay lah bye bye
emotional ah uncle itu
tak boleh lupa eh kelakar
okay whatever you call it ah ya that one also some already uh like uh apa itu
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already merepek right
maybe lah he want to save that way or what alamak then I regret seh sekarang menyesal seh tak pakai tiles yang kita pilih
dah bersusah payah kita pergi hafari lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi ya kan saja
itu lah dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak uh tak licin tak jatuh
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever pun so
habis uh nak kena plan nak kena
plan itu lagi budget lagi nak kena plan budget nanti you bilang I nanti I buatkan breakdown
kan so kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa kan toilet pun kita baru buat cuma maybe kalau tiles itu memang
tak bagus itu tukar saja lah sebab dia punya slope pun ingat tak kita kan suruh dia buat slope jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi
pun masih bertakung tau I cuci toilet pun I tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya slope dia
uh uh tapi yang macam accessories macam tempat mandi uh apa itu picit-picit nak cebok ah tu semua
uh boleh pakai balik ah so at least itu dah save cost sebab itu pun under dalam quotation juga
ah itu dah save cost lah lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah
kalau let's say ada budget untuk buat yang rumah punya pun actually perabot tak payah cuma kita just ambil gambar ah kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada
tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun considered
uh apa itu macam modern apa modern minimalist pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu kan senang sikit lah
mm modern juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak mm
lagi apa eh kita dah tukar eh
so far yang kat dalam toilet itu ya lah kan lampu uh ya so hopefully
mm tak ada lah sekarang plan dia is ini tak standard plan is one uh kitchen two toilet
sebab itu kalau you nak buat kitchen saja ini susah memang dia comes together so might as well buat saja
sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit you tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga K habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit then end up kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya kan
so kita betul-betul buat sekaligus lah lagi pun toilet
lagi pun uh bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah kan habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu ah
eh sekali terus habuk semua lah
ah betul
lagi bilik bilik aqi pun
mm bilik aqi pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang vinyl vinyl sahaja
dah berapa uh that time eight hundred kan lapan ratus vinyl sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini
kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu toilet itu semua nak kena
mm kalau kita buat balik lah
itu kan pintu toilet itu kan dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena nak kena
hack nak kena plaster balik
semua akan affected
tapi ini click function kan vinyl itu remember
tak boleh lah ini ini kena potong kena apa kena measure sembarang saja
entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi ha
tak boleh dah haus you tengok dia punya
dia punya tengok ini dah hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada gap lah dia dah ada jarang-jarang in between dia punya ini kayu
then how how because vinyl pun boleh kembang ikut uh panas atau sejuk tau bilik
ah dalam bertahun ah ini ini pun macam tak tukar ha ini dah kembang lah ini nampak line dia ada gap
lepas itu tak boleh ada gap itu hit itu lah dia dah ini merekah lah itu
uh uh eh ini tak bagus ini I think murah punya ini bukan yang vinyl tau ini yang
dia orang pandai kan eh
ada record
kau nak tahu something at least

that's all and then the next the next message he sent me was I think like two days ago and he said like hey I know this is weird but can I ask you for a favour then aku macam seram sejuk tau aku macam what favour sia this fellow want to ask
ya like now apa they don't even play music there
only now because now all the social distancing people like go there and like check like if you want to lepak at the beach also
so like when he tell me he want to like ask me for this favour like a part of me was like a a little bit like macam
vindicative so I was like sure even if you get the place kat dalam otak aku ah aku fikir you want to get the place tutup mm it not gonna be fun ya
makan cake

got no sand nearby so I see already I'm like okay nevermind lah but okay then my ex like no no it's okay got life jacket got life jacket if not you can hold on to me I'm like okay fine sial lah the minute I jumped into the water I straight away like just started screaming like no no no no no I want to go back I want to go back on the boat sampai the freaking thai boat man pun ketawakan aku sial then my ex like no it's okay it's okay I'm like no if you don't put me back on the boat I will cry here now that was my threat I will cry that's it
like a kid like he hold out the hand habis badan aku kat atas tangan dia and even then I was freaking out I was like no cannot then he was like babe why are you scared my hands are right here how are we going to travel ha and then go swimming and all these nice places I'm like um I'll I'll swim in the shallow waters

I also cannot like panas sial only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay lah he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun kan but I cannot like the bed very comfortable lah then I just go back to sleep
so sometimes I wake up then I turun bawah already cause he's doing work right then I see breakfast dah ada
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed mandi take out his clothes and stuff and all that lah so
then he was okay he he still can layan okay ten thirty aku tak bangun kadang-kadang I will wake up early I'll wake up at eight but then ah because I wake up too early right then I tell myself okay lah my alarm ten thirty uh no my alarm at nine thirty so I can still sleep I still got one hour of sleep right that one hour of sleep become two hours sleep lah bloody hell then when I wake up it will be always like after ten thirty then I see my message he already

I wake up to him waking me up because he buy back lunch he walked back from his office and he got lunch for the both of us then he makan lunch already he go back to office

cause afternoon we're going to town to go robinsons or tangs I think and then I was thinking okay by the time kita habis we will probably be eating dinner
and then we will go to town so I won't have time to go and bring him there then I was thinking kalau dia orang buka pagi then I can go and buy first
and then harap-harap ah dia boleh muat
because I don't think he got I don't think he got I don't think he got baju that will match that colour dia ada baju yang boleh match ni
he will eat lah he will eat he he he likes food in general babe dia tak picky when it comes to makan dia tak picky like even when you spicy like deepavali aku bawa bawa balik apa lauk-pauk

that was you you are being told to sleep there kita takkan suruh kau tidur situ the three of us sleep on the bed but if let's say the bed is a king besar right then we
we tidur macam
macam mana uh kita tidur melintang
means kita tak kita tak tak ikut cara
boleh eh aku pernah buat aku nenek aku dan kakak aku pergi holiday kita
kau jangan aku tak suruh kau tidur dekat bench aiyo
a'ah betul tak payah fikir banyak-banyak eh
actually aku tak tahu kau cakap apa tadi aku cakap jer
tapi tapi tu kau kena bawa as in the hassle is we have to be
okay I I think you can get at nanti aku tag but I don't know when I'm going
maybe Daiso punya is for
oh because I know that it the trend is macam you know like like baru-baru ni ah orang baru nak cycling
ni pasal ah
okay lah ini semua pasal COVID lah orang semua
cari cari apa kegiatan eh
kegiatan eh
ah riadah seh
eh uh apa tu ah next year ah we do something
actually I'm supposed to go out just now to collect something then I tell the person can I come tomorrow instead cause like I saw the it's scorching hot then I was like ah apa aku boleh buat productive hari ni okay kemas bilik
tak sweater lah this is this is not sweater this is
no it's tak tebal it is tak tebal
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe entah bah
wait wait wait so kirakan like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like err
ya we top we we top the rank ah isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases tu lah pasti
but by that time um we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like kita pergi Bangkok for like satu minggu holiday
even though like you know there were threats of um like you know this unknown virus being spread around lah tapi
we went to Japan habis habis lepas tu was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal
dia pakai dia the kind macam dia pakai mask
habis like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a uh metal tube with like hundreds of um other people like he will refuse to wear dia punya mask and I'm like
aku tak faham so anyway
sorry so ya begitu lah but ya then after that it's like err
uh they took unpaid leave and then after that err I I I tanya dia orang lah like eh so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on err what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then dorang cakap macam eh kau lucky sia kau um um you left at a very good time and then I'm like
but ya macam begitu ah and err like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
you do you remember that um the viral video that fiasco the whole Ateeqah Mazlan punya benda that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like macam padanlah muka dia
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up siapa is it or something is it I can't remember
ya habis tu apa macam like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them dia macam nak dia berniat nak
dia I think I think her niat is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place um apa eh
uh like the current regulations that are in place mm related to home based business begitu
tak satisfy is like an understatement because dorang I mean like you know like melayu punya backlash is like next level dorang macam like oh err
err dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup
kan as in what do they say uh they said something about like err nak tutupkan err nak kacau periuk ah
periuk nasi orang something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi so funny
okay I did not think that it was our good friend Hadi pasal si
of course lah I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID eh sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan kan
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum macam frus
dia orang masih kerja like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than uh more than ever and like
it's still a kerja ah kerja tu kerja lah but like you know
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some macam
the apa tu barang barang for the err how do you say the the items for the supermarket kan
how how long is that show two hours is like dua jam I don't think you can like squeeze everything together lah
highly taxing job for example kan macam like in a family a a low income family of like for example dia punya anak dia err anak dia special needs kid
habis lepas tu the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older habis dorang tak ada they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
people who are like who are eligible for like macam help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular um like income ceiling for example and then after that like macam err
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like macam you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so macam I guess
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like err because err apa
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very leceh pasal like you know because
there were at least macam twenty people in the class then after that like err we
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so macam kita very move very FOMO
and this was the very funny part so kita orang punya exams we  kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one eh apa eh
we were revising and basically we were revising based on err what the exam usually entails lah macam like
like like ada ada open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
err so that time nak like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working ah
uh there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book tapi kita orang macam like
eh get real lah kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan you know go on Whatsapp lepas tu kita text eh kau tahu tak what's this what's the answer for this but in
so it's like um basically we were err there are there are like three different kinds of exam so macam like open task
so macam like we get on we we all got go online lepas tu we all sit down together
buka tu link duduk for two hours ku duduk situ
kau buat tu err exam just like a normal exam tapi err ni in the comfort of your own home  begitu
well nothing because okay for that macam the time exam kan the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like ada forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
ha you memang betik
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people habis lepas tu like now err bila I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now pasal like err how to say this like um I'm much older than I was obviously
dia pandai tahu dia pandai she graduated from mass comm eh no she graduated from advertising
Ngee Ann similar course tapi dia punya dia punya
distracted tak tak boleh tahan so I had a project before just like macam like maybe two weeks ago ya so dia sibuk dengan dia punya boyfriend punya birthday
habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam you know it's a group work
so nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk and then discuss lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa in a powerpoint
presentation nak kena prepare pasal kita orang ada presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that kita kena buat like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
I said to her okay you know what aku buat aku buat yang lit review punya part lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like macam kita orang punya um information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report itu pun dia tak boleh buat
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so dia boleh
dia boleh lah pergi mana mana like dia punya boyfriend dia punya twenty third birthday dia pergi prepare all the apa tu
gifts for him bagai can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
because is like even though when I was working tak ada chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
itu part time just
we are online uh we doing online lessons right now kan so like half the time kita
um kita log-on like at 9 o'clock
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and leceh gila then I was like err
tak nak ah malas ah but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks um
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that duduk dekat atas meja lah and do my work
this semester so I macam like to be able to connect with them in a level err I mean like online everything is very cool
as in this particular Food Panda thing dia punya promo jer daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja as in like err
entah lah
ha apa
kita boleh pergi pe Sentosa island or like pulau ubin ke pulau hantu ke like our friend went to pulau hantu what recently
itu itu next level I was
kejap now is like almost two o'clock ya I what's what's classes what are classes
eh thirty plus dollars compared to my twenty five thousand dollars is nothing okay diam sudah diam
no tak payah lah just stop jer
I don't know ugh I I don't have access to the the Whatsapp right now kejap eh

okay jadi kurta ni dia macam
it's very hard to find kurta dekat mana like to find where kurta is
ya so we went I don't know why but we decided tekka tekka confirm ada kurta
so but there was there's a lot of like err you know like indian wedding costume which is like lawa gila but ya oh ya that's true so so we found like a cheap one cause like I I macam I felt that it was err the first one that we tried was macam dia macam forty dollars
and lepas tu ya and then lepas tu kita went and find some more there are ada satu twenty dollars
ya ya so so kita ya so kita beli that one err without the pants you know just the baju
and then pakai baju and then okay kita nak makan sebab dia nak belanja dia nak belanja makan

ya okay let's start with the questions okay so kalau you ada three wishes um what would you want or ya apa you nak
oh is it so so you mean be visible then boleh macam pergi lelaki punya toilet
oh ya ya ya ya okay so your first wish is actually to have a superpower like jadi invisible
ah okay okay so your first wish is to have a superpower then err your second wish actually nak banyak duit lah kaya
oh ah okay okay can can one superpower and lagi satu is nak what you just wanna be like rich begitu or you you you you want to
ten ten K only you have one freaking wish and err ya apa yang kamu tanya is setakat ten K jer ten thousand
like eh I I bet like other people oh I have a wish okay lah aku nak um one one million but but kalau one million macam sikit sangat ah um maybe I want um
I nak err satu satu juta satu juta is it uh one billion I don't know
where no you must answer the last that the third wish you you nak kena answer the the ya
nombor tiga belum jawab ah
ah oh ya you you cuma minta um jadi err invisible tak ada orang boleh nampak then you setakat minta err
you wanna you you wanna have like err sepuluh ribu jer
the ya jadi nombor tiga
only without err only without sucking blood lah jadi err so tak hisap darah ah tak apa kira macam err friendly vampire lah kan
your wish your hajat hajat is untuk dua is superpower
then lagi satu is okay lah a a genuine err general wish ah
ah hajat yang tepat lah kan
goblin apa pula goblin what's
what right um apa ya uh um
I think um tengok cerita-cerita macam psychological thriller err those err political err zaman dulu-dulu punya like you know the olden days
then err also macam bunuh-bunuh orang punya like those murder kind of scenes

you nak tahu kan my three wishes also

and pass down to the generation also lah macam maybe ha
um maybe dalam
apa ya
what is uh million in malay ribu err juta err
juta then ribu is billion
ribu thousand juta is million then billion
billion you don't know juta ah okay so dalam
beberapa juta sia
okay lah then like that kalau nak safe
safe to say err dalam seratus seratus juta
seratus juta also equivalent to one billion right

penat penat seh asyik kau kerja
bila kau start kerja baru ini fourteen december berapa minggu jer
excited the place is near your house kenapa tak mana kerja aku cause di sini sia ada macam some kind of progression
kau dah buat berapa lama di tempat ini wow that's fast ah
so moving back into like your um cakap siapa tadi
bila dia orang boleh masuk singapore
apa tu barang fashion ke barang household rumah ke barang fashion jenama fashion orang keluar masuk kedai kenapa apa seh
orang beli bag warna-warna buat apa
so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so bodoh of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
that was so bodoh of me
later you help me out tolong aku I seriously feel so bodoh realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
really really except for those who are working shifts and dekat the
finally after so long of working shifts penat seh kerja shift
bagus berharap kau boleh stay kat this job lama I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down ke apa ke and it's always like unexpected suddenly
dia cakap besok semua try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed eh I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but I think my weakness is makan asyik pergi makan jer as much as nak buat melipat kan macam need to plan for the week
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth ah I think kena makan for like tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk the
fifty dollars for the um the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses punya routine to relieve menses tu
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments lah this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what lagi dua bulan
but but dia cakap kalau boleh makan more sayur-sayur but sayur pun kalau bagus like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food pedas-pedas tak boleh you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat pedas punya makanan because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet susu pun sama but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house lah we all cook this interesting dish lah so it tasted like those kung pao chicken so instead of using santan the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use macam make up for it macam it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually kan I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based um their kidney macam feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle dia kan macam quite a high stage diabetic lah then he had to err inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like macam too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that cara nak masak pula because we are so used to like masakan melayu masakan wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs what other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some buah-buahan
too manis yes but some buah got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
nasi I makan nasi basmati so
penat because kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat three thirty ah menahan menahan taxi
I was stuck at home apa tu actually aku aku mahu see yang tu juga mm mmhmm
I know right you always take the bus early or late oh earlier lama dia then what did you do take train
creamy meatball are there any other sayur inside your bowl
wow mana ada ini oh I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place ah I don't like the inside ah so busuk cause I sat near the kitchen so sempit
benda leceh saya nak buat actually
buat basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
nak perlu impact oh habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia
kan lepas tu dia cakap macam kind of um okay no
masa itu masa itu emas time is golden
she ask me that you haven't kahwin that time I thought you kahwin already then she ask kat apa
she say that time I fall down only I kahwin next year aku kau
want to be what dia cakap
who's that siapa tanya
you have to plan lah all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something ah you are so convinced to buy the item wah the person say bagus ah this one okay ah I try also
maybe they are selective lah yes yang macam cakap boleh bagus
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food makan sedap jer then what about those like unhealthy
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch asyik-asyik makan sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew apa I mean it must be strong in kimchi flavour
kenyang tak why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
it wasn't that bad but okay lah yes ramen spot is the best like kat mana opposite lau pa sat kasih area gyudon
poke bowl I don't know salmon what did you eat at lau pa sat yang dekat lau pa sat itu is it like the soy based or the miso based or
I saw that I saw the person macam mana dia apa sushi cake eh the salmon cake savoury cake savoury sushi cake yes is like a decorated cake but it's like all salmon mentaiko all savoury I feel we should have that for our next birthday
it's filling ah kenyang ah
pucailok the long bean with like asam I don't like the corn just the long bean and you eat it with the you know scrambled egg like the side nasi you how about you
orang melayu ah or like someone who belajar melayu
you rasa
to improve dorang punya
yes belum keluar
oh kat yang bedok is it tanah merah
apa tu err
and I got like three days off you know how I told you macam I
sepuluh hari lagi left
slowly slowly ah slowly gila
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths uh they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit macam
ah macam gitu lah ya
but apa tu
the apa tu the
kurang ajar seh kurang ajar gila
it's not it's tak compulsory tapi macam
eh asal you tak baca dulu sebelum you buat paper
okay I think that was me in in apa tu in
secondary school also when kita buat lit
okay jap
speedy ni
speedy tak tahu lah
dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini tau like everytime dia
everytime kita nak everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
okay lah okay lah tak cukup attention
tak cukup apa tak cukup attention kesian dia
but apa tu
so dia baru join
because there was this other person but he selalu
ya it was quite rabak uh
err apa tu err
ya lah abeh nak mandi semua
so anyway he told me that lah he told me macam
so macam he was damn lost ah
my language classes then dia macam
dia macam tak cakap apa-apa never say anything so aku macam okay
ya so it's a bit macam give me some heads up uh
tu lah
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot paksa orang to
datang and you know
and then macam it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I have to really plan macam straight away after finish
pastu keluar lepak and then go straight to work atau sleep a bit more and
tidur jer kerja
ya and because my shift pukul berapa pukul tiga
no takde takde takde
no they dorang big fans of macam the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill uh actually
tu lah maksud dia
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything ah because it's a totally lain punya client ya
ya she she took chemistry in the pastu um
that I've been very complacent macam I've
not complacent macam terlalu banyak
err oh yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok the the deadline and all that
abeh kita proofreading we put everything ah like whether the date is correct
the numbering and all that and the oh categorisation and all that is betul
macam whether they
whether they apa tu
volunteer because kita punya kerja kan banyak ada nak kena chope
macam you must chope certain deliverables lah
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of macam mana kita kerja
okay so pukul tiga setengah I bangun
let's say pukul lima we have to send headlines
because I'm the kind of person yang I cannot tunggu for people
like I'm not a apa tu
that was last time uh remember I told you there was like one time in between july sampai
september ke august
just jaded like macam
so dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat
orang ketiga lah
apa benda home wrecker
no I think dorang nak more natural conversation so that
I know lah but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
I don't know takut it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kesian seh
ya what have you been watching lately cerita
good tak it looks like very old
berapa episode berapa season
satu jer ada
okay bagus
ya it's so sad uh banyak
banyak but
shows nak kena
either like postpone their dorang punya release because of COVID
bila dia when is it supposed to be
ya same as apa tu yang mugen train also what it was released quite super damn early in apa tu
in japan lepas tu like only came in singapore berapa bulan jer nanti
ya macam
not transfer macam how they send over copies to
macam but what what cloud can carry that then how we have google drive
ya I'm I'm so interested in that macam I think that's what
to datang in like in a dalam ada bawa briefcase
wait so back then actually dah ada
err apa tu portrait on
ah nak kasi nanti lah sekejap lagi
ya twenty more minutes sayang
speedy nak say something
okay tunggu kejap jer just now I give you food you don't want to take
pastu macam gini ah how how how anyhow like that can ah
tak don't breathe on the thing
ya macam
apa tu err different types of
jap eh do you want anything from pasir ris
tak nak my brother can get Gong Cha you want
ya macam
then macam
I don't know lah there could be those directors yang very macam oh I need this shot
I need this shot it needs to be this particular way you know macam
ya what what kind of movie would you film melayu
would it be more macam
embodies that the most yang paling
paling like paling dekat show that the kind of movie that you like
okay more prominent ones yang kita tengok Handmaiden tu was it good
mm macam the food change eh food chain
wah takde movies what movies is
you know what I mean like you it makes you think macam oh my god whoa
but like you know when he went through the apa tu
kan ada I don't know whether the lady or the man yang cakap
if dia go through the door
did we watch another movie together about the the cerita indonesia
yang ugh was I with you
it was this cerita pasal
who had to balik to balik kampung sebab
dia nak reconnect dengan family dia ke apa
ke oh dia nak dia nak cari
remember yang dia hang baju pastu
cerita apa eh
yes yes yes that one yang tu yang tu
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like uh tanya or ask anyone I don't know
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
oh yes you're right you're right betul betul betul
betul betuls okay lah
cute gila oh my god it's very cute
ya ya I dah wash lagi I dah basuh
I dah kering
I dah apa lagi err vocabulary boleh kasi dorang
I kering I dah squeeze dry
I dah compress tu jer
ya I dah I've done quite a lot of things lah
ya so as in it's drying now tengah nak kering I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
bawa balik ah mana satu yang you nak
because it all looks so pretty semua lawa gila
dia macam those who know will know right
and then people think like err this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai jer
ya we've talked about this before berbual
like you know how when it when it's macam when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
dia macam it feels a bit cheaper because like
oh now they are going more mainstream lebih mainstream
popularity of macam demon slayer for example
not as popular of course lah but macam ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise nak beli nak beli apa lagi
ya macam these merchandise nak beli baju you know
ya lah but macam if you if it were another show for example macam Fruits Basket
atau I don't know what's another show I don't hear it err hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular eh macam you know what I mean
well known so macam that's why I say there's pros and cons ah
you tahu kan I ada classmate jepun in my korean class
so dia
so macam most of us kita ambil sebab kita either
kita tengok cerita K drama dengar lagu K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so I asked her like oh how about ya so I asked her macam
and she say macam
macam real people
the life in japan macam how was her school life or like at least lah
she's quite nice lah then she shared with me like about her school life uh how dia kerja part time
quite interesting ah it's it's I love this class because macam
and like the eleven year old punya remember I berbual pasal
cute gila
ya because like I like I talk to her about macam my trip to yogyakarta the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also macam in jakarta and how dia rindu lah rindu gila dengan jakarta tapi she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place paling
tak kat yishun not at yishun
and then um dia macam I don't know
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to um calculate lah because dorang punya numbering is very susah gila it's like
dorang count kan dorang punya currency besar gila kan
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
so nak kena you must really calculate lah
banyak fikir ah I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
exactly but macam
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to layan my korean I feel like I'm such a
lawa gila it's very it's super damn it's super nice
hello hi how are you I nak minta tolong sikit lah boleh tak
tu lah my parents nak makan nasi padang ah but I don't know where can you
recommend I don't know where is the best nasi padang in singapore I mean I know the the usual ones they have they always like to go to their favourite is like hajjah maimunah you know but other than that cause hajjah maimunah I went went there just now today they're not open
mm tak kisah lah
I think I think I know I think I know yang mana satu we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried sana sedap eh
oh is that type lah I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that kena eh tak payah eh
oh sebelas this is for lunch lah
ya nasi padang I think the most of the places jarang ah eh I think but there's one place I don't know you pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa eh nama dia I think it's called sari ratu you pernah pergi sana buka I think like pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka tau
I actually have no idea but I pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu
dia punya lauk masih still looks fresh lah tak tak rasa macam
since pagi ke apa maybe dia orang masak petang juga but okay lah kalau in case you keluar dengan your family or your friends
tekak you nak makan nasi padang you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road lah but it's it's quite near the kampong glam area like baghdad street or something like that
oh apa nama tempat dia eh
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall kalau pergi sana I think
okay lah I think I will try that that what minang place there
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing err my parents dia orang nak makan sana cause just nice lah think after that I boleh ke nak jalan around the area beli kain-kain ke apa-apa
that that area got a lot of kedai-kedai macam gitu kan jual kain lah jual buku-buku lah jual baju lah carpet lah
tak tahu eh belum ada plan but around that area got a few malls kan
for the house I don't know like pinggan mangkuk ke apa think whatever ya lah
dia orang nak beli I think nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak I think can bring to think bugis junction quite near
ya lah I think everywhere lah the same but now if possible duduk rumah more ya cause if you have to go out also yang no choice then kalau nak keluar you buy whatever you need to buy you beli dah beli dah makan ke apa then terus balik then kalau you nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue nak kena tunggu and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now banyak orang buat gitu lah tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa you nak beli kadang-kadang you beli online you tengok colour ni
nanti datang colour lain
kita kita boleh hantar balik kan dia orang boleh
tak boleh refund ke
wah ya lah and gambar you tak boleh cannot
trust kadang-kadang
then in the end what happened did you makan the nasi jer
I think I think got banyak lah I dengar complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
untuk self pick up you know you order then you pergi sana sendiri you you you
you pick up the food sendiri then I order at first they say the food should be ready dua puluh minit then I dah sampai sana I tunggu almost one hour baru the food siap
that one lagi self pick up kalau I tunggu dia delivery I think mungkin more than one hour but this was back then lah during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think semua orang order
pernah order grab takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah kan
tu lah nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup then bila order tunggu satu jam ya lah that time I I ada satu friend pun dia ceritakan dia order I think err mothers' day I think
ah dia order pun dia order err
dia dah order tunggu lama-lama the punya app cakap waiting for driver nak dekat dua puluh minute in the end tak ada dia dah order order order tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap cancel dah tunggu twenty minutes uh huh
day ada orang dah advance order the day before to arrive for example eh dia cakap you order for today esok dia suruh deliver for makan tengah hari
pukul dua belas ah on the next day lah they advance order lah then when it comes on the day half an hour before dia orang cancel dia punya order
orang orang nak buat celebration dia orang buat macam gini tu lah
ya lah but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault lah it's all the the the the restaurants kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana then restaurant yang cakap cancel but dia orang tak fair lah then the driver the rider kena marah
I think maybe for safety juga lah I think kalau satu not not dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver lepas tu orang tu cakap eh dalam eh inside my my packet got
for example lah dia cakap I see hair then they complain kat restaurant nanti restaurant will cakap eh but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant dia orang lah pasal dia orang yang pack makanan so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy kerja dia is just to send so kalau
ya ya lah you can see tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard err I got one friend kawan I satu err whenever dia order
kasih dia orang tip kasih cash ya lah but sometimes a'ah dia kasih extra like maybe two dollar ke lima dollar
I tak tahu lah I think so but I think maybe
maybe dia orang order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya lah but good lah then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot what kalau dapat tip and not say
kerja dia orang senang ya lah senang as in cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang customer complain lah customer marah so I think once in a while ada orang
kasih tip macam gitu
kasih dorang macam motivate dia orang lah at least ada juga orang yang
baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah jer
tu lah cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada deliver kan bagus eh tapi I cari semua tak ada
tapi nasi ambeng ada deliver tapi nasi padang I think tak ada
kesian lah
dia tak ada offered to refund ke apa-apa that's not good actually
cannot lah the customer dia orang bayar apa
so nanti esok you nak ikut tak I nak pergi cycling mm
I think kita dah quite long time kita tak pergi changi beach lah
takpe lah we go kita pergi early lah morning you know I mean by by tengah hari we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya lah this quite some time I pun dah lama tak tak ride my bicycle
you punya bicycle masih ada tak then okay lah is it the same one that you beli dulu
cause recently I think that day I I I ada beli I went to the bicycle shop lah to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet dah dah koyak dia punya strap I was talking to the owner of the shop dia cakap sekarang like everyday dia jual like maybe
I think so cause that time dia orang tak boleh
wherever lah tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang lah tak boleh pergi shopping lah
I think dia baru baru buka lah aiya maybe I don't know tak tahu eh
maybe lah I think they they the the new movies I think maybe kalau rasa
you rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi
tengok maybe they wait lah they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
ya there's no apa
esok esok kita pergi to changi after that after that kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak mm
okay kita pergi the famous one lah kat sana yang changi
I think the I don't know I think maybe the sambal lah okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
esok kita boleh try lah kalau kalau kalau makcik
beli I senyum kalau pakcik then you senyum okay think just nice lah so we go cycling then go nasi lemak ya then after that we head back
tu dah macam yang kat bangkok kadang-kadang boleh panas
abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu ya
I think dia punya macam
ya lah I think dia punya mungkin usually like that dia punya dia punya what you call that dia punya longkang ah dia punya drainage sumbat of course lah then kalau dia punya rain was like that day
pagi sampai petang what six seven hours ya lah
if the rain that much then the drain sumbat mana air nak pergi
ya lah tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang those landed property
okay lah but this kind of weather I think susah nak predict kalau you tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan or the other way that day pagi hujan lebat then dia stop
I think dia orang also just tikam jer lah
maybe it's the other side maybe you kat east side tampines maybe kat choa chu kang ke jurong yang hujan right mm kadang-kadang like like that what not the whole singapore
uh oh kesiannya then
mm mm that means ya lah lama lah
I think most of the the what you call it apa dia panggil dengue hot spot eh dah banyak dulu I think tak banyak tempat I think near my place also kat pasir ris ada there there there's err
one case opposite my block mm ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum dengar then terus dia pergi luar dia check dia punya pasu-pasu bunga make sure tak ada because kalau the officers datang
they can summon you kan I think ya so kalau you have like tak lah
I tak tahu I think they come random lah it's either that or either that or I don't know eh mungkin kalau ada neighbour yang complain tak tahu kalau the neighbours suspect you you tak
maybe lah maybe dia orang they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe dia orang take like a a sample
of the water something like dia orang bawa
dia orang punya lab agaknya dia orang check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back lah they take some sample of the air bawa balik to lab then run dia orang test agaknya lah but ya lah sometimes they will check what even if they cannot see kalau dia orang tengok let's say rumah you
ada ada plants ada potted plants then dia punya air dia tengok eh macam tak tukar they will tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air do you change everyday because by right you kena tukar so at least if
happen to be the nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau you tukar hari-hari
then dapat dapat
but you you get to buang dia punya telur apa ah kalau let's say you
tak tukar I pun tak tahu I pernah baca I don't know lah maybe takes a few days lah maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the nyamuk
telur to tukar lah so kalau you leave it for that long then maybe you might kena summon lah kalau dia check so that time my my mum dengar dia terus check
ya lah kat rumah pun semua tukar at least everyday lah
ya lah so kita
kalau ya lah because the the like what's the
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang
tu lah
kalau you kena gigit pun mm
so I think if you if you rasa macam you kena gigit dengan mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor lor dia punya mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then dua tiga hari lepas tu you demam I think better go doctor you check
ah tak ada dia
mm then that one can can can lead to complications lah kalau tak kalau biasa punya after some time it will it will get better ya lah but leceh lah you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you kena dengue
then you cannot see what kalau dia nak gigit you dia pun tak tak warning
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day dia punya the number of cases for COVID lah was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
these countries I guess because dia orang punya
ya then some of them might not be even kat hospital you know
ya ya lah because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers tak boleh kerja kan
semua orang first time pun tak tahu ya but
foreign workers was was told to quarantine eh quarantine themselves duduk kat dalam dormitory tu kalau I tak tahu rumah you you tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat my office pun sama dia punya
dah tak terjaga ya lah that shows
the foreign workers are important only time time macam gini then people realise oh ya ya lah this during this difficult
period you boleh tengok macam orang yang what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like macam those tadi kita complain pasal grab food driver and all that ya kalau you imagine kalau dia orang tak ada that time circuit breaker you nak makan macam mana
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch baru dapat
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody bersihkan know your around your area under your block all that
ya lah but tempat your workplace how you still going to work or
when that day I think I was at the area lah raffles down there lah you can see I was there lunch time macam tak ada orang mm can see that there is definitely different lah you see the lunch time crowd macam more like a ghost town I would say
including my my tempat kerja pun I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen lah sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause sekarang dah berapa tiga eh dah tiga since march dah lima bulan dah
working from home still masih survive apa so why do they need to like rent office mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap business jalan
kalau you kat rumah pun at least you save transport right if ya lah our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
maybe the only thing yang you spend more I rasa mungkin is just your utilities lor
kan bila at home
if not usually you are at home malam-malam and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven hari-hari
because bila dulu time sebelum all these terjadi orang semua nak keluar so sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah
ya betul
iya lah mana dia orang nak pergi
airline pun even the airline nak pergi pun the the the I think the government doesn't allow
kat singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though kecil still got a lot of places if you want to explore
give them more things to do if all the businesses tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat
takkan nak tengok jer eh but everything
ya I think like hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa
ya kalau tak it's not like kita
we said what the wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun the cinemas belum buka so
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new macam wayang I mean filem-filem yang baru mungkin more people will will go kalau tak ada orang not interested ya lah at least they have entertainment at home or more
your ya but I think no choice lah sekarang semua kena gitu
ya like dulu pun macam apa tu during bulan puasa orang nak bayar what you call that the zakat fitrah ya but now also everything online what dulu people would queue at the
masjid you know mm even
the yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya I think all the woodlands jurong I think they were I forgot I think tak salah I ada sepuluh ya ten different places where they have the celebration lah ya
ya kalau dia orang buat dekat the same place then more people will go there what so I think they have to lah to to elakkan orang go to like the padang or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people tak akan you know berkumpul at the tempat which is better lah everything lah like err I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
ya lah cannot lah some more lagi that kind of event I think you're talking about
saw got people post gambar-gambar yang the river singapore river lah the some of the beaches the sea looks
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi and then kita kat sini I mean we don't experience that that lah but for me personally I tengok bila during circuit breaker tak banyak kereta you can see like you said bila kita pergi jogging kat luar ke apa macam
lagi fresh dia punya air tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also lah that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
apa yang yang I nak cakap you tak payah spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business lah like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves lah but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you ada whatever lah
hobby baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu lah eh
main gitar bernyanyi lah
ya kalau if this thing didn't happen you you'd takkan tahu yang all this thing you boleh buat so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side lah or what
kita complain complain hari-hari pagi petang malam pun you complain also the thing will still remain then takkan today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
true ya but I guess people are just people dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak complain dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap right
macam ni lah government government kasih duit orang complain government tak kasih duit pun orang complain
betul kita cakap orang pun I think kadang-kadang I pun complain juga
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you nak kena tengok you tak boleh degil you know nak dengar cakap you jer
complain but at the end of the day I think especially kita kat sini kat singapore I think kita still not as bad as you compare to other countries
you can't even I mean you can maybe you boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin you boleh beli
beras all those barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin
satu minggu sekali but still singapore I think
itu pun ada orang kan that time berapa a lot of people masuk facebook masuk stomp tak nak pakai then kena kena all the officers suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal
ya by right bukan susah benda tu nak ya lah macam like
I see them tu lah that time
government kasih free leh nak minta dia orang pakai

the ones who are actually voicing out are not the saudi arabians when ya which is very sad the one who's making noise is the progressive one you know turkey turkey is the one that eh dia ini macam macam mahu but they are the ones actually advocating for change so I don't know I it's so messed up

it's like totally malam-malam tak ada benda nak makan kan then you just
ah you really masak maggi ke masak apa
but sederhana lah you know
just biasa punya

twenty eight so my parents cakap ah

some more my cousins semua kat malaysia kan so they cannot really come in to singapore
ah tak apa lah you know just make do with what we have right now lah you know
ya he's gonna get engaged then next year then married lah tengok macam mana lah because
he he's the kind to prefer kalau
all my cousins ada
and most of my cousins semua kat malaysia so tengok dulu lah macam mana
kalau phase three they allow us to you know
I feel like malaysia sekarang macam
dapat pergi malaysia fuh full on
pergi usually if I go there I pergi mana eh
johor bahru yang
ah pergi johor bahru ah dekat apa tu the mall nearby
ah city square mall also pun kat situ pun ya
murah-murah pe barang
ya you normally ya ya you through the woodlands ke tuas side depends

kakak famous
I feel you I feel you okay ah there are also macam there are also perks to wearing masks ah like you don't have to tegur
all the time like you see people right you don't have to tegur what because you don't know they don't realise that it's you you know
ya tak
ya tak perasan lah
bila nak snow eh
bila nak snow ah
panas sia
so right now you still cari kerja lah
so right now you still cari kerja lah
oh okay lah uh right now pun I feel that
ramai orang yang tak ada kerja they can apply for this um
I pun ada apply I pun ada apply for other jobs but they also gave me the same reasonings like oh you are overqualified or you are underqualified
the macam for certain positions they will say macam um
tak ada hal panggil hal ah
right now pun aiya susah lah as long as I feel that kalau dapat kerja pun ambil jer lah eh
ya lah tengok condition dia lah you know some people they just
so kalau pay is not good
oh kerja apa tu
cause I applied for teaching macam english you know languages lah basically
ah macam tak faham ah I just
tapi ya ya papaya lah you know just
leceh lah it's just part of the routine right sekarang
ya lah it's always like that lah the management sometimes when you tak when you don't have a good management right

was minta kena sepak sia
ah dah burn ah tak payah lah

either work from home or face to face ah I preferred tapi
also depending lah like cause I'm doing project right like I said then macam
projects so basically uh kalau ada apa apa
ya ya you know the kalau
macam ugh malas ah it's better to do face to face ah you know like lincah can just
whatever lah right now pun
so ya I know kat sini quite bising
um right now kat sini ada renovation my area sini
it's a bit suffocating kalau you stay at home work from home

that one that one I don't know sia I don't know I don't actually know how it works kalau your partner is a non-muslim
I tak tahu seh ada benda macam gini

aku ada harapan kan siapa tahu nanti next counselling session mungkin beliau dapat berikan aku peluang kedua aku tak tahu lah kan kalau itu terjadi aku akan berubah kau akan lihat aku tak macam sekarang
aku rasa sukar tapi aku tidak menafikan segalanya terserah kepada allah taala jadi kalau benar-benar terbuka hati dia tiba-tiba mungkin dia nak kasih aku peluang aku akan pastikan

dia sekarang status dia okay lah aku
kata dia dia bilang aku yang dia sudah denounce dia bilang aku dia dah denounce bulan may last year
jadi kira dah setahun lebih lah dia dah denounce tapi aku tahu mungkin dia buat itu kerana perasaan marah jadi
yang allah subhanallah wa taala dan tuhan kita dan nabi muhammad salallah wasalam kita punya ah rasulullah kita punya ini
aku rasa tak jadi masalah aku rasa masih boleh bawa dia ke dalam akram kan tapi pendapat ustaz sana kan dia boleh
ah peluk balik lah agama islam kan tapi mungkin nak kena bagi course lah kan

kau tahu lah budak-budak muda sekarang kan dia tak peduli tau kalau kau dah ada anak bini tau
dia kalau sukakan kau ah dia punya cara simple tau okay lah kalau you suka I
you ceraikan bini you ah banyak macam gitu babe jadi
tahu tak apa dia orang tak peduli tau
ah kita punya masyarakat zaman sekarang very selfish mereka tak fikir ini semua
jadi kalau kau rasa yang kau engkau mesti ingat tau kau punya tujuan sana kerja
kalau ada situasi macam gini aku tahu ramai lelaki-lelaki kat luar sana yang akan
tak ada kan scandal dia orang lebih suka macam gitu tapi aku rasa kau orang baik kau jangan start ini semua lah tak baik kau tahu asal
nanti walau dia boleh bayar kau dia boleh sponsor kau dia boleh
ah support kau mungkin kau tak cukup duit sebab aku tengok kau kadang-kadang sesak macam aku juga kan
nanti dia kata eh azri you okay tak you you nampak macam apa ni takda ah I punya motor

dia orang akan kalau perempuan tu kan kau dia akan buat ni semua babe dia akan beli kau dengan duit dia orang tapi bila kau dah termakan budi mereka
apa yang berlaku kau akan rasa bersalah sebab aku ada anak bini jadi kau mesti ingat tau kalau kau nak pinjam duit kalau perempuan nak tolong kau kau mesti hati-hati

ah ada plan tengah hari mungkin nak jumpa I punya wife nak makan sama-sama kau bohongkan gitu sudah
itu lah cukup nak kasih dia piss off kau faham perempuan ni
bila dia orang nak bila cara untuk kau macam kasih mereka marah ataupun macam turn off kan
kau sebut nama perempuan lain mereka akan rasa turn off ataupun eh orang rumah kau itu tactic dia
ah jadi kau tanya aku kalau kau kalau kau takde sini macam mana bagi aku eh aku akan teruskan kerja sini macam biasa
aku tak boleh get attracted by your deparute kau tahu asal sebab kalau aku tinggalkan tempat ni kan
aku aku boleh bayankan cheng mun macam mana
he'll be under a lot of pressure faham
kau tahu lah li che tak suka dia
fiona pun tak suka dia aku rasa cheng mun pun mungkin tak suka dia roy pun tak suka dia ramai orang yang mungkin tak begitu suka dengan dia
pun macam gitu aku aniakan dia takkan babe sebab dia dah tolong aku
bila dia pilih aku terima aku bekerja walaupun aku melayu satu jer aku bilang diri aku
kenapa harus aku aniayakan dia aku nak kena support dia
that's why kalau satu hari tadi dia bilang mister see kan kau nampak kan kalau kalau kalau apek boleh tolong
aku akan beterima kasih sebab kirakan engkau pun support aku punya boss
chey syarikat seh kau cakap syarikat macam macam kat malaysia eh
dioye lah sini sini sini punya company ataupun iya lah syarikat untuk your right eh sini punya persatuan ah syarikat company semua ni kan
mereka punya cara satu mereka kalau boleh nak nak save cost ataupun nak kurankan perbelanjaan
dia orang nak kurangkan segala-galanya babe
mereka ada sikit macam apa tu favouritism memang dekat mana-mana semua ada
ah tapi bagi aku
tak ada sebab apa sebab sebab kita punya tu kan mereka dah cari orang tapi orang tu reject orang tu tak nak datang so bagi mereka aku dah buat aku punya kerja tetapi kalau
okay azri nice to meet you again so I just wanna say that kadang-kadang kita ni hidup
memang banyak dugaan life is full of challenges and of course what happens is like
jadi pendek kata kalau kita ni um
uh suka dengan kerja kita kita teruskan betul
kalau kita tak suka maybe dislike ataupun there's push like this then we have to
so in short K kita nak kena tahu
apa jua yang kita buat dalam dunia ini whatever we do here okay
ah jadi macam mana kau nak kekalkan kau punya ah
contohnya tadi aku bilang sama boss aku bilang sama you know aku bilangkan tadi kevin call aku kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email dia I emailed him
dia punya request for this um to come down to check look at one eleven kan
was exhaust kau perasan eh so aku nak dia propose based on kita punya requirements apa dia punya exhaust fan size semua lah
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty dia akan turun padang eleven thirty
kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu kan
then boss say kenapa aku cakap because when I try to activate rin cho
he can he macam ah always busy kau faham he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and buang masa
tunggu contractor yang tak begitu focus
ataupun yang not really looking for all these things lah so aku bilang dengan boss
ah aku bilang boss ah aku bilang covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to azri and me about what they need kan kau ingat eh
ingat tak the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
dengar dengar dengar they are the only one eh that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one tau even Y&T tak kasih eh Y&T belum kasih
Y&T kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat ah Y&T kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah reject alright
Y&T belum kasih tau ah abeh tu aku nampak ah kai long ada kasih motor oddly eh
air asia tak kasih lepas tu ah ray choo belum kasih abeh tu company C belum kasih
kau bayangkan tau of all kita punya contractor lima company
ini covalent one company can give us that two proposal tau and it's only company kau faham tak
kenapa wani tak nak kasih so it means aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya specs
nak kena call lagi invite quote for the other company lah that's what aku nak kena bikin later
mana covalent
boleh ah kau tengok kau tengok proposal okay bagi aku okay not bad
dia propose bikin asia semua kan boleh
can be done ah so aku nak kena minta dia orang so whether they want to go or not itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan we need lagi dua quote betul
ah lagi dua quote kita perlukan lagi dua quote untuk aku bilang kau eh aku macam nak minta lye kasih kita quotation sia untuk aircon works kalau dia boleh bikin
lye boleh
lye lye lye lye ini tau takkan tak boleh
kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul lah
bukan ah aku belum tanya dia lagi tapi aku rasa macam nak panggil dia orang sebab
aku tengok eh macam rin joo
dia kasih kita proposal kan dia rin joo belum kasih tau dia punya proposal I will write to him again
so far I've not really okay you see eh aku tak tahu what was the arrangement before my time
tetapi bagi aku aku still akan invite dia to quote for whatever that he needs to quote lah correct
sebab the idea was given by him correct pasal itu motor correct
so ini semua aku nak kena standby dia punya argument aku nak kena standby any email dapat nak kena tembak email sebab
every month care pax kita nak kena update alexis tau apa dia punya updates kau faham
takpe I will just send them another invite because I'm going to send invite to beberapa contractor jadi I want to see how is ah their
response and memastikan mereka boleh berikan peluang aku tak nak satu hari nanti mereka cakap oh aku penat-penat turun padang I came all the way down meet azri and rasyidi

this one install okay lah noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so dia cakap
ah kata dia lah so okay lah so diam tak diam kirakan yang yang suruh rosakkan
so that is the arrangement lah so tomorrow si covenant turun
we have to focus on this O one eleven exhaust kau tahu pasal
ini benda eh we really need to get the quote soon because richard dah tanya orang pun dah tanya
because ini beruang punya madam F kau si xie
si gemuk tu kan dia nak handover bulan september tau
he wants she wants to handover in september like that kau faham
ah place ah so mereka dia ada plan yang
hebat lah untuk dapat tempat tu tapi
she got some requirement kau nampak there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up dia punya cement twenty five add twenty five
lepas tu half of the probing
then number dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu then they want to put the
nak letak gas outside lah then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
ah dia dia kirakan they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
to the centre of the place that is dia orang punya ah so called short floor lah correct
jadi ah twenty twenty five tau look
lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada big kitchen so that the other half eh all the way to the end of the unit is dia orang punya area ah
ah itu naik atas ah naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya
tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak obvious ah kan
depan depan the shop front front would not be affected yang belakang dia akan itu
ah they won't akan affect lah because behind they have to put some
ah frosted glass ke apa they have to do something to cover the behind ah
tapi dia orang ada intention nak letak itu gas cylinder itu sebelah kanan
the dia punya piping dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya ah cladding tau masuk dalam above ceiling
toilet eh dia orang kan most likely aku tengok dia orang akan convert sebagai store because dia kata dia tak nak dia punya staff gunakan toilet tu
okay lah I mean tu dia punya hak kan it's up to them
then they can dia orang boleh convert tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang lah
ah to me okay lah I mean as long as dia orang bikin
apa yang dia nak gini tapi so far aku rasa based on my understanding is like
ah cakap dengan fiona I told fiona as and as long as you tie your sprinkler
that is a requirement tapi kan he said masa tu cakap tak payah there is a waiver from then you must show us which clause ah
tak boleh dia mesti ada submission you must do a proper submission
yes I know dia bilang apa tau dia punya orang gas will do a submission

get a get a real job yes ha susah sia nak cari kerja sekarang
err I ya lah but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me uh pasal my wish is my need ah right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish ah to something else I tak tahu apa ah
dia orang cakap by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb err
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know oh my god I don't know how we gonna do it lah but ah I rasa dia punya
dia punya the struggle is gonna be real lah like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless kita hop on trends or unless
we have quality content lah but I think we have quality content eh I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that err getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I rasa itu paling susah lah sia
I think you are confusing streaming dengan video kita memang buat video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the err console to record the whole the whole the whole session
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing ah so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play lah because I don't think people wanna do that yet kita kita not at that level lah nor we want to venture there pasal kita I think
streamers orang they are like deejays they are like radio deejays dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak inside jokes ah where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff lah but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality ah ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
so people will be interested lah I I I baca dekat dalam dekat youtube dia orang cakap if you want to start something like this ah you have to be you have to know what you are
uh like you are trying to focus on ah macam
macm kita kita nak kena main this specific game jer tau because what people want is people want
this content from you jer so you macam the speciality ah so ya macam they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a macam a doctor advising sickness what that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy kita nak kena like specialise in this one game jer and then like a random kadang-kadang kita we see if we can selit one or two games inside
apa like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game lah ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I rasa challenging sia
tak ah of course not man
kita punya tak begitu sia I I make sure the content that we kita push out semua quality sia I mean it it should provoke a feeling lah and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness err like you kalau ketawa I think that's that's quite good already ah where we ini kerja keras like a no brainer you just tengok habis doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad lah pasal kita edit susah payah kerja keras sia ni
oh the live stream one memang tak ada apa-apa like only live stream one is really moments lor the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
settle sia I dah belikan safwan dah
err I rasa like fifty err so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya
but this one I got it for cheap lah like dekat Ali Express so that was good
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause err I mean it fits ah I have no complains ah so I assume they the custom made it ah cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself ukur ukur ukur ya
got your help with that ah you ukur kepala ukur shoulder ukur my forearms
for the kids is just S M L I dah belikan safwan tengah on the way safi tak tahu kalau dia nak pakai ke tak maybe when he's older a bit
spider gwen ah okay okay ya tengok ah rezeki kalau ada lebih
I rasa nak pakai black cat lah no black cat is a spiderman version of cat woman but he's a black cat no
yes no I don't know I tak pernah where got spider spider cat is cat not a spider I say black cat I never say spider yes
I rasa nanti I minta cheese fries ah
tomorrow tomorrow dah call dah kalau tidak
take lah half day bila lagi nak ambil
next two weeks baru christmas
next week ada apa
ya is it bila you on leave right I thought you have long leave like
I accumulate dua puluh hari sia you
I selalu I selalu err selalu like fikir macam like last year punya tu I selalu tak nak habiskan I selalu simpan for the day that I want to leave the company
my plan is always to keep leave so I can macam ni I have to serve notice two months sia you now at least I clear leave I serve like

the it's it's like a is a triangle so it's two triangles lah kalau you nak beli is two triangles but because it's not flush because that thing is gemuk dia it will protrude out lah so you won't be flush so you will be like ke depan ah
because kalau buat satu then the other one tak buat then the next time kena buat then is like err what buang masa but I think it's fast kan yang that time your father tukar jamban knock knock knock letak jamban baru macam cepat sia like in less less than a day dah habis sia ya that time remember ya lah he call somebody ah your err abang punya father

orang kan adik adik tunjuk ibu kan gambar yang tadi kat corner itu ibu nampak
corner sini pun ibu boleh nampak I see a light like
different colour like ada macam
brown ada green
but you punya gambar

who say dia gelap
no I said because inside dia punya
facebook dia ada taruh inside nasi dia kat dalam
so that dulang is I know is for four to six pax punya makan lah
so far tak ada yang untuk two pax
so actually I already ordered semua individual before that I already order all because I tengok tak ada
for dulang for two pax is always uh four and above
err macam not so nice like nak kasih uncle one packs two pack like macam
tak lah uncle dombang like kasih like one packet two packet like macam you know
uh apa
in a dulang
you look like macam apa pre pack your food macam ini you taruh dulang like cantik ah nampak ayam nampak semua ah
instead of that ah so that cakap possible not to do this dia cakap yes possible
so ibu cakap okay lah since dia cakap possible so I make a table lah put there
tray lah dulang in a in a dulang lah I cakap
dia cakap ya possible
so after that I send him the table to show that dia jangan salah lah
then okay they can put now dia pergi buat satu dulang
four daging
apa eh
I cakap hidup
if I known I cakap I won't ask you is it possible I ask you is it possible then you said ya ya can
itu that time kelmarin yang
we order takoyaki uh that day satu then after that we order yang nasi yang masa mika datang itu ibu order the tray satu
ayah satu buang lah but we actually ibu nak buang sekali ayah pergi cuci so ibu okay ayah sudah cuci put aside lah so ibu pakai that tray lah
so the rest pasal ibu ada tupperware besar sikit then okay lah put there lah ya
ibu purposely bikin table tau
uh ya lah like macam I I put there berapa eh
okay I put there bento mandi chicken
mutton masala okay that one's all correct memang one bento one packet
then three bento uh bento mandi chicken with add on kofta kebab
okay that one also correct ada tiga mandi chicken with
then I book one set mandi chicken uh buffet for five pax itu yang
dia bikin yang ibu cakap untuk kita kan dia cakap for five pax itu pun okay I he understood one set
then in the end dia kasih kat ibu
ya lah after that ibu call dia lah pasal bila sampai dia kasih ibu like packet dia ibu cakap macam tak nampak that round tray ada empat it's it's only satu but then I don't want to make a fuss I I ah cakap eh this one is only satu jer habis dia cakap ya lah ya lah I'm like just carry jer
just carry bring back itu lah then bila sampai rumah nenek ayah nak pack pack lah kat situ habis kat sana macam panas kan then ibu cakap no lah hantar rumah nenek satu then after that
kita pack pack
uh habis pergi rumah nenek then baru ibu buka ibu buka
satu jer that big round tray with itu habis
then I call her lah I say cakap you know when I say you put in my table I stated there four set what so by right must have four set lah why it's only one if not I just put one set right
otherwise ibu pun tanya dia it's possible because in your photo it's already show what is only five and above punya tak ada one pax for apa one round tray for two pax
entah lah jiu yang hari itu kasih habis after that
dia cakap okay lah habis dia cakap then how ah why like that I have to solve myself lah you ibu cakap
ask me how okay sorry lah this is miscommunication lah dia cakap
habis ibu cakap ya ya ya ya
tapi the night before I think before dia buat I think wednesday
can I just confirm that those bento change to dulang
is four bento of ayam and four bento of daging am I right
so masa itu ibu tengah tengok jadi ibu ibu cakap okay wassalam sis zus yes including four kebab so I think they misunderstood this
bila dia cakap salam can you just confirm yang those bento change to dulang
is four bento ayam and four bento of daging and rice so dia pergi taruh into one dulang
so maybe they refer balik to this
tapi dia tak pergi refer balik to the table then I cakap you look at the table table I put there four set
uh marah lah then
I brought actually I just inform err apa ibu bilang aunty bait jer yang okay no need to cook uh I'm giving you something to eat lah habis aunty bait cakap okay lah so the rest ibu tak bilang uh aunty lisha ibu bilang because ibu takut dia bawa siapa mika pergi swimming
jadi takut dia tak tahu jadi ibu cakap uh I'm sending apa
to you lah habis dia kata no need lah no need save money lah now COVID lah save money I cakap I pay already lah cakap dia cakap don't waste money like that I pay already lah oh you pay already uh uh okay
so I promise ibu sudah cakap aunty bait dengan aunty lisha saja so the rest ibu tak cakap then just imagine kalau semalam ibu sudah balik ibu balik dua belas setengah dua belas setengah balik sini uh pack pack pack sudah pukul berapa orang pun hungry nasib baik ibu tak bilang yang lain ada orang tunggu tunggu kata nak hantar lauk kat mana uh
tapi dia orang hungry macam mana
the one who make noise is ayah bukan ibu lah
of course ibu uh huh angry juga lah but then ibu tak
you know ayah kan the way ayah cakap kan that's why ibu cakap no
sometime we plan but allah yang tentukan yang whether
of course we will nak macam gini tapi we plan but then if asal allah tak izinkan allah cakap no it cannot be planned as what you want I will change the plan so uh if you can like this lah
ah dia bila dia gitu dia diam lah nanti jap ya lah tapi
uh tapi bila ibu cakap allah itu dia diam lah
and then kalau ibu cakap like uh
tak apa lah agak orang itu apa mana boleh ah dia kata
so by the time ibu hantar pun sudah pukul berapa

it's just sedap
tempat dia dekat sana juga ah I think we talking about the same thing
and err ya mostly barang macam
mee goreng combo
because it's near dia dekat dengan botanic garden ah
I always eat dekat Adam's Corner
cause you just need to uh naik bridge
and and you already reach it uh macam dalam five minute
if I go makan there I think
maggi goreng combo and the drinks I think
oh I'm sorry my melayu rabak sikit
so tebu is definitely not bamboo
K K I'm K salah saya
I pergi sana is because
so bila I go there ah
dia kerja dekat suria is it
I tak tengok news

I anggap rugby as a
whenever nak pergi training
so bila kaki tu injured
uh kena pergi doctor
so bila
time kecil tu my bicycle
tapi is not your normal bicycle is like
so daripada situ I pick up uh skateboarding also
so I play dengan skateboard together
tak ada break any bones because I want to continue playing
dengan skateboard and also maybe hopefully
kalau boleh lah um play rugby in another ten years
we live our life together sama-sama in dalam satu rumah happily

ease off my mind off uh jauh dari rumah at least you know
meet somewhere that macam
uh boleh relax my mind

ya actually betul juga ah macam
tak tipu actually is one of my favourite
tokyo drift punya cerita uh in all the movies

ya macam for me
macam mana I boleh suka bola like
semenjak kecil uh
semua of my family

actually I suka club too because of the history
uh but it's datang from a rival club ah
after like how many years dia orang menang club uh cup

easy life baru datang so don't expect everything to be easy

ya aku tengok
aku tengok aku lebih suka tengok attack on titans lah but
err if I'm not wrong suka demon slayer over it cause I don't know why but like okay lah I see I watch both demon slayer also not bad lah
actually dia also
cause the series each episode is like twenty minutes if I'm not eh forty ke twenty minutes lah
the movie is ya for one episode then the movie is tak salah twenty ke forty lah tapi the movie

bro countdown tu apa new years new year gitu lah eh
kita orang berbulal jer like relax relax jer eh
kalau gelak-gelak continue ini lah
okay akak lah share dulu
sixty percent banyak juga itu sixty percent
mm mm ini sebab semua orang dekat rumah kan
rasanya eh bukan
sudahnya sudah tak ingat tapi kalau biasa kalau sebut goal untuk setiap tahun kan
tak lah masih hiburan macam tahun-tahun lepas tak berjaya
maintain a'ah tapi
ya lah sebab kan ada masalah spine so
macam mana pun kena turunkan berat badan tapi itu lah masalah sampai sekarang tak boleh turun-turun
a'ah so itu tak tercapai lah kan
kalau segi err financial tercapai lah
sebab target dua puluh dua puluh nak simpan err lima belas K
lepas itu dari segi kerja kan nak kerja
maksudnya yang kerja yang kerja baru lah kan environment semua
dapat lah sebab sekarang sudah kerja dengan
walaupun untuk masa sekarang contract kan tapi at least sudah bertukar lah
something new lah okay dari segi
err ibadat pun rasa macam teruk banding dengan dulu kan dulu kan waktu student kan dia macam
affect result lah macam tak tapi sekarang macam makin teruk kan padahal makin tua makin ingat tuhan kan tapi
mm ya lah banyak doa doa nak rebut jodoh jer asyik jodoh jer kan tapi
ya lah benda itu tak seiring dengan yang sepatutnya ah itu
macam nak kahwin lah nak kahwin
tapi tak tak ada rezeki untuk kahwin so kita bawa kepada tahun ini lah dua puluh dua puluh satu lagi apa ah
um dari segi apa lagi ah dari segi
hubungan dengan keluarga tu makin rapat sikit lah sebab
err since kan memang ada dekat rumah
so memang kita orang kita orang satu family semua dekat-dekat
maksudnya kita orang banyak masa bersama macam itu lah
sebab sebelum ini memang ida daripada metrik memang jauh daripada family ida saja yang jauh
a'ah so sekarang macam oh banyak lah masa dengan dia orang so macam lebih memahami lah lebih lebih menerima
itu bukan dia pasal dua puluh dua puluh satu eh
decision yang membawa kepada itu
mm tak cukup sepuluh ini
oh macam ida cakap tadi ah dari segi financial ah itu memang kita sudah nampak kan memang
hundred percent achieve kan lepas tu yang kedua oh satu lagi ida
dengan business ah
err a'ah dengan business err lagi satu
err dua puluh dua puluh
err apa ini tahun yang sangat menguntungkan lah ida bagi ida dalam bidang Shaklee sebab
monthly ida dapat maintain income empat angka
ah macam seribu minimum seribu tiga ah
macam itu sebab kita kat rumah kan eh so kita banyak masa dengan phone so kita nak focus ah dengan business online
so apa lagi ah achieved a'ah lepas itu
mm dapat kerja macam cakap saya tadi apa lagi ah
mm okay dapat publish dua paper
okay empat
a'ah empat lepas itu um
lagi ah
apa lagi ah ya allah teruk ah
okay oh saya
oh sebab ida pun terkejut macam wah banyaknya
ida sudah ida ida berjaya call ida ida berjaya membantu orang dari segi emosi lah kan
seramai seribu lebih kurang ah seribu empat ratus orang
ah ah ya sepanjang orang yang berada di di pusat kuarantin kan
a'ah lagi apa lagi ah
oh sebab tahun dua puluh dua puluh kan sekarang kita sudah ada
seorang yang ida bantu untuk dia
a'ah so ida macam bagi dia ida berjaya lah bagi dia semangat untuk siapkan
dia at least dia sudah nampak
at least dia sudah ada chapter one till five
walaupun belum nak pass
okay so sudah cukup kan tak cukup lagi eh
okay lagi satu kan um ida sudah ya lah kita anak kan kita rasa macam
kita nak bantu parents kan kita nak bagi duit setiap bulan
okay err sebelum ini dua puluh dua puluh itu ida dah ida maintain
err ida berjaya maintain setiap bulan tanpa miss
ida bagi dekat dia orang uh tiga angka seorang ah macam tu
so ida macam okay so hopefully dua puluh dua dua puluh satu ini
ida berjaya maintain lah bagi mungkin boleh increase
um macam itu ah sebab sebelum ini kan tak ada duit
pendapatan oh okay okay bagus
tak ada lah kot can
oh dia tak yakin ah
because apa
macam rude dia itu bagus ke
project tak dapat jalan
terlalu painful tak percaya ya
saya um dengan bahasa yang sopannya saya putus cinta
then yang lagi yang lagi painful adalah
err kan so so memang saya tak dapat nak buat apa-apa tak akan lah saya nak
suruh dia putuskan hubungan kan so saya terpaksa terima lah
the most lah kan lepas itu second
second err waktu first
eh itu first COVID ini datang saya rasa macam oh sangat struggle
sebab sebelum ini you tak pernah duduk rumah tanpa buat apa-apa
so then tak pernah duduk rumah selama itu
kan biasa berjauhan dua-dua buat kerja so saya rasa benda itu sangat
sangat menyakitkan lah untuk untuk that okay
yang okay saya dalam hidup kan
so adalah yang rapat kan dua tiga orang
then yang paling menyakitkan tahun ini adalah
a'ah tahun okay dua puluh dua puluh kan
yang dua puluh dua puluh ya like bila kita sudah tak ada kawan kita ada kawan rapat saja at
of course lah kita punya expectation itu
tinggi kan sebab ya lah kita tak ada siapa-siapa so
err untuk tahun dua puluh dua puluh oh saya baru tahu dia kawan
so dia kawan adalah untuk untuk err kawan untuk waktu susah
ah waktu dia susah ha waktu dia susah lepas tu
err saya pantang kalau orang menipu ha saya memang pantang
so ada satu hari itu dia cakap dia sudah balik semenanjung
tapi waktu itu kebetulan saya ada dekat airport
so memang terang-terang dia dia itu ada dekat airport okay dia bagi tahu dia sudah balik dua hari lepas
okay kebetulan dua hari kemudian itu saya pergi airport
so saya nampak dia dekat airport so maksudnya dua hari sebelum itu dia belum balik
dia masih ada dekat sini tapi dia cakap dia sudah balik huh
so memang terang-terang itu kak itu dia okay
so saya rasa kepercayaan saya tertipu lah kenapa dia kenapa dia nak menipu
bagi tahu saja lah a'ah
so saya rasa kalau benda itu
benda itu dia balik eh eh salah
tak payah sebut tempat eh
ya lah benda yang besar macam itu dia boleh tipu uh ya lah dia nak balik daripada
daripada sini naik flight kan dia boleh tipu lagi lah benda lain
kan yang kecil-kecil saya rasa macam
susah lah untuk terima okay lain tak ada kot okay tiga saja
yang saya rasa betul adalah saya buat keputusan untuk saya stay di sini
untuk masih ah berada di sini jauh daripada keluarga walaupun saya cakap tadi
saya punya relationship dengan keluarga sudah makin bagus kan tapi saya masih tetap
familiar untuk di sini berada jauh daripada keluarga jauh daripada
itu lah
kita pun struggle
uh apa soalan itu tadi about decision kan
first ya lah bila saya pilih kat sini then err waktu hari itu saya dapat kerja saya dapat tawaran juga dekat terengganu tahu
a'ah sebenarnya
yang pilihkan itu salah apa lagi ah
okay lagi apa ah
tak ada sudah kot
kan tak ada sudah kot
apa ah
sama saja lah
ya lah someone special pun tak ada lagi
mungkin tinggal house mate lah house mate
dua jenis saja lah
siapa ah
mungkin saya punya mentor dalam business lah kot
okay the business Shaklee kan saya punya mentor
a'ah itu dari segi financial lah sebab dia
err dia manage untuk dapat income err
six figures setiap bulan
a'ah which is seratus ribu lebih ah setiap bulan so dia memang million earner lah
itu dari segi financial lah
okay dari segi
oh kalau macam dari segi ibadah kan benda yang baik macam
neelofah lah kot sebab saya sekarang baru saya follow dia dia punya telegram
a'ah so dia banyak share kan dia banyak ya lah dia dia
dia macam dulu ya lah yang kita yang kita nampak artist kan social tapi
dia punya ilmu macam makin lama makin ah improve dia punya sharing
pasal hadis lah pasal benda yang baik-baik itu rasa macam ya allah bagusnya macam itu
so satu lagi oh seorang lagi ini lah saya punya sahabat lah lelaki
err yang saya panggil dia bapa so sometimes dia macam
err sangat memberi inspirasi lah untuk settle scandal itu macam bersemangat
err oh expect sebab dia counsellor kan maksudnya dia dia punya mentor saya juga lah
so kadang okay dia banyak bagi saya support lah inspirasi
yang tak tahu masa eh ini
a'ah tak semestinya positive kan
untuk dua puluh dua puluh ini ramai lah
sebab dia macam ada dua fasa tau
yang satu keluarga lah sepanjang kan berapa enam bulan kan
so dengan family so dengan dengan parents lah dengan parents
dengan anak buah dengan parents dengan mak ayah anak buah dengan kakak
dengan house mate lah ah itu lah
oh okay ya apa-apa nak duduk call
oh dia orang memang influence ah
kalau kalau macam family tak ada lah influence sangat kan
itu macam biasa saja lah okay kadang ya lah kadang kita yang sendiri minta
dia orang suggest apa-apa kan so tak ada lah cerita-cerita mengarut sangat kan
so cuma kita consider lah kan
tapi yang paling adalah bapa lah itu dari dari segi semua lah
pasal saya punya kerjaya saya punya financial
lepas tu ah pasal kehidupan lah
ya so mostly yang semua nasihat semua ida ikut eh ida ikut saya ikut
okay sebab saya ini bukan yang jenis orang yang baca buku
menyalahkan a'ah
ada satu buku ah buku ada satu buku ini ida pernah baca tajuk dia walking tau
ya lah ida tak ingat sangat isi dia tapi ida ingat ah buku itu
buku warna hijau kan dia nipis saja buku itu buku itu banyak cerita pasal ini lah
pasal kegagalan lah so macam mana dia bangun untuk terus berjalan
aku kena cari balik yang ada tak so apa lagi ah
okay ada satu buku ini buku cinta tahu
bukan dia macam buku romantic lah ida cakap tajuk dia I love you
buku itu tebal sangat ah buku orang putih juga
um I tajuk dia I love you so buku ini
um oh dia dia macam flashback balik uh uh penulis dia perempuan lah
dia flashback balik apa yang berlaku sepanjang dia bersama dengan kekasih dia
a'ah so err saat kekasih dia sudah mati kan
lepas itu dia tapi perit dia dia dia sudah tua lah so dia memang sudah spend
err so dia dia flashback balik daripada zaman dulu macam mana dia kenal macam itu lah
so kadang dia dia macam
okay before before lelaki itu meninggal lelaki itu sakit tau so before itu dia sudah
okay dia isteri dia dia memang err sangat dependent pada suami uh kekasih dia
ah so bila ya lah orang putih biasa lah kan tak kahwin so
dia sebelum oh dia sakit dia sakit lepas itu dia makin critical so
dia macam nak ajar uh perempuan itu untuk berdikari
so err sepanjang sebulan lebih dia banyak menulis
so macam okay dia dia akan tulis dan dia akan simpan note note
dia dia tak tulis dalam buku tapi dia buat note macam sticky notes dia tampal dekat situ macam dekat
ah mana-mana lah dia suruh do eh dia tinggal notes ah
lepas itu lah bila suami dia meninggal so dia nak buat eh
bila kekasih dia meninggal so bila dia nak buat itu dia akan jumpa notes itu
a'ah macam itu so benda itu
dia dia tulis lah buat macam flashback kan ah so dia rasa macam
oh maksudnya walaupun kekasih dia sudah meninggal tapi benda itu ada ditinggalkan so dia rasa
ah macam itu ah banyak ah a'ah lepas itu sebelum dia meninggal tu
err macam bulan depan akan birthday perempuan ini
so dia tinggal lah something yang perempuan ini boleh celebrate
ah macam itu sangat sweet a'ah
so dia sudah tempah orang hantar bunga
okay macam itu ah dia sudah prepare so ada lah note dia yang dia tulis so perempuan itu rasa macam
memang perempuan itu sedih tapi dia dia dia dia mesti dia sudah accept
so dia hidup bersama dengan lelaki itu walaupun lelaki itu sudah meninggal ah sebab itu tajuk dia I love you
gitu lah
yang to do
tak ada akak buku tak lah baca buku sebab sekarang kan
tak ada buku ini buku ini sebanyak kan online kan so so sudah terlupa macam itu
ya lah kalau tak lah kan indonesia buat macam itu sekarang kan
okay satu yang paling ida bersyukur sekali adalah
ida dapat bangun dan ida dapat move on daripada pengalaman pahit ida sebelum ini
kan bila kita sudah bila bukan kita bila ida sudah
so sebab kan macam sebab kita orang okay tiba-tiba saja macam itu kan so kita macam eh ida macam
eh gila ah tapi memang betul-betul gila tapi ida mampu untuk bangun sampai sekarang
a'ah macam itu okay lagi satu
lagi satu ida bersyukur sebab ida masih dapat berfungsi dengan baik tau sebab kadang-kadang
macam ida boleh sekarang ida boleh pergi kerja hadap jam kan
duduk kereta lama kan sebab kan ida ada masalah spine kan so macam
setiap pagi boleh bangun pergi toilet itu ida rasa macam sudah bersyukur at least ida boleh bangun sebab ida pernah
err tak boleh bangun tak boleh berjalan

and then ya mama loves to watch al-hijrah punya news because the news all like macam
no the news is like juicy gossip news so one of it was about first news was about the err adik ipar pakai motor dia motor dia hilang
so rupanya dia ingatkan adik ipar dia curi which is true lah dia curi lah as in without the permission lepas tu accident
ya but anyway adik ipar dia meninggal bro
oh about the banjir oh then pramugara buka kedai it was quite fun ah actually when we were watching it
kan macam so juicy
besok thursday eh
you rasa apa jadi
pasal there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
lily give birth with seluar
then I thought ushu will kahwin the
ya so complicated and technically he already lafaz cerai
when he said that no he put a syarat he said that if you go and see your father
I will ceraikan you remember
he pull back the cerai is it that's what
because talak will jatuh as long as your syarat is tunai technically dia punya syarat dah tertunai tau pasal dia cakap macam gitu he said kalau what did he say ah something like kalau
you jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau
apa aku cerai apa aku eh macam mana eh
no lah cuma I tahu kalau macam benda gini you kena consult ustaz because ni fasakh
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the talak dah jatuh then you have to just reconcile lah and say aku nikah dengan you know you have to lafaz it back eh no need to lafaz it back but you have to do it with a saksi something like that ah meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why yang that time ija ibu dengan ayah he lafaz it right then they already back together what because mubin kept on pestering them back as long as the talak dah jatuh they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered cerai and they have to immediately consult
ustaz or as in like ah
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to angkat nikah back again
arwah mak long and pak long is cerai cerai dude
kan he already cerai her kan twenty sixteen kan kita kahwin kan ada satu gambar mak long tak ada
ingat tak then mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita and then suddenly pak long say ah okay okay kita then he asked mak long to walk away then I was just there like wah that's mean
kawan I satu mengandung then she complained kat twitter dia cakap yang every time kalau part dia share good news dengan family dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian eh
meaning like like kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak so dia selalu ada anak apa so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
uh doa-doa kakak kau ah yang mengandung you know
no uh ya tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah
tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek then nenek is like saying you know
obviously he's gonna nenek still staying with mama
ya lah he's gonna buy it from pak busu
pak busu bought it at hundred thousandish cheap ah so unfair ah
I pun tak tahu why ya
dia nak hantar anak dia yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year kan anak dia so two years ya so
tu yang tadi one of the parents say
alah dia sihat for the next few years jer dah happy
apa you nak cakap tadi
kan I dah lupa
ni ah nanti lepas ni I treat you to
dalgona kalau tak tidur
I layan ah
no I layan you ah tak tidur
a'ah seh I want to watch more than family seh dah dua hari
dude you lagi into the drama than I am seh cantik eh dia tapi macam flawless
kamal adli macam very like
that's true ah and then meletop I think that was what they talking about like they wanted
ya lah dua ribu dua puluh we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
kan tu lah masalahnya
semua resolution pun dah tak tercapai semuanya
err of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye lah cakap pasal redo back everything sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight lah memang nak nak turunkan berat badan lah harap harapnya macam tu tahun target eh
this year target nya lebih kurang dalam maybe fifteen ya
serious ah sihat ke kalau macam tu
oh I cannot do the skipping sebab dengan spine issue lah so macam kalau skipping nanti patah pula tulang belakang so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
tu lah
ya achievable so I would say that kalau fifteen maksudnya dalam sebulan kena target at least two lah
tapi tapi sebenarnya one half pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu lah lebih kurang
ya so that's another thing lah pasal vegetarian kan macam ya before this sebab baru adapt to vegetarian so banyak makan processed food lah
actually adapt tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat macam tu kan sebenarnya tak boleh so I was thinking of this year kalau boleh nak jadi vegetarian and grow my own food like tanam sayur ataupun tanam
tanam sayur lah basically kita orang dah tanam benda lain kan macam tu lah anyway
ya how about you how about you what is what is your resolution untuk tahun ni
for business apa lah apa apa the idea business yang dah ada buat masa ni
I see surprise delivery menarik
I see so the surprise part lah yang betul-betul make meaningful
I see so macam mana sebelum delivery ni dia akan ada macam set set dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh customise ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu
okay faham
so basically ni macam err macam bukan professional dia macam lebih kurang special customisation lah
okay tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam uh food based ke ataupun
oh okay lah okay maksudnya dah ada customer ah
oh wow ya ya ya ya sebab ya lah sekarang ni orang pun suka eh macam boleh pergi surprise delivery lepas tu boleh hantar eh boleh share dekat Insta kan macam tu lah
I see interesting it's interesting so apa lah nama the surprise delivery service ni apa nama dia
oh wow okay kotak riang so kotak riang basically like macam gift uh box of happiness lah box of happiness
okay okay okay betul betul new year resolution lah
so what do you have for now ada tak benda-benda yang ya it's still give you some happiness in the world tapi healthy lah
I see tapi sugar free how is that achievable even
menarik menarik so err healthy diet healthy food
basically ya lah macam kita pun tengok kan dengan COVID punya issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat kan ah so ya penting lah very very important lah untuk
tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah when you get rich I will be the first person yang you have to belanja lah kan aduhai
oh resolution lain apart from losing weight I would say that okay lah dia macam satu we have to look at the whole system lah kan I started with trying to eat
healthily kan I want to err I want to lose weight so I have to live live err I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just kita nak kurangkan berat badan is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet kan most of the thing yang you beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak tau
especially sayur lah macam tu kan jadi macam I was thinking of and kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam supermarket
kan so we didn't know pun macam kita opt untuk healthily tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya lah mm kita tahu economically macam mana
macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya sekarang ni ramai juga kan orang monetise daripada YouTube kan and then ya betul betul and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
betul betul okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya macam
orang kata tanam jer lah tapi sebenarnya nak tanam pun ada cara kan ya ya ya
ya interesting hmm okay boleh boleh masuk dalam resolutions seterusnya okay
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so cakap pasal healthy and rich kan kalau lah you nak sum up lah the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word lah apa you punya apa one word yang will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
wow oh okay alright alright maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni the the timeline the the stories not good yang you need the plot twist
untuk diri sendiri eh
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person macam it ya maybe with better networking kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh bring it forward kan ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself lah I would say that two thousand twenty dengan COVID dan sebagainya it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
tak jadi apa-apa pun so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the kind to the world lah like environmentally more friendly lah
okay apa lagi takkan tu jer apa lagi share lah resolution
mmhmm what what kind of me time like pergi bowling macam tu
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill yang you dah ada and then you want to enhance ataupun like new skill
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like jadi ya jadi pemain guitar oh my god
ah okay ya masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama I didn't really update
but but somehow piano like ini dua benda yang berbeza tau mostly guitar punya song it's like metal you know very hard one piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it juga makin besar makin matang you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
I see so with before this kak long pernah juga ada idea macam nak enroll class tau and of course I want to also look into yang macam elegant elegant ni lah kan cuma kenapa bukan piano sebab piano requires some set up lah then tak dapat berlatih kat rumah kan macam tu so I was thinking of beli ukulele ke violin something like that lah so macam at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you kan kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak wind punya apa ni punya instruments you need a whole band baru dia akan menjadi or you main trumpet sorang-sorang macam ni lah dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward tu clarinet that's clarinet so it will
ah Squidward kan so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it lah macam tu
interesting okay lah basically kan macam kita boleh tengok kan sometime our education system
focus on more maths science tapi kan art art is very important human very connected to any beautiful things be it the beautiful things tu dalam bentuk visual ataupun audio lah macam music kan because somehow that makes us
err be more empathy kan dan buat kita more human lah and in your own case kan macam memang buat hard science buat maths kan err
at the end you will turn to robot lah if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you macam tu kan okay so piano so that's the skill yang basically dream lah belum belum start ah do you have any skill yang just you want to enhance lah yang you dah ada dah ada base base[lah
ataupun something lah selain daripada skill err musical skill ada skill lain tak
but mandarin is kinda hard though because tak silap mandarin kan dia ada macam empat
empat macam apa eh apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi something you know
ya that's the thing sebab basically ya bila kita boleh connect to to a person dengan dia punya mother tongue it will be lebih ni lah kan
ya ya lagipun kita pun multi racial I think it's best untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga kan betul betul interesting interesting
so okay buat masa sekarang how many language you know like even it's amateur pun tak faham how many I will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea daripada mana because you watch oh my god alright alright
so many language cakap pasal korea I watch a very very good good drama I'm not sure you have watched it or not tapi dia berkaitan dengan business lah since you pun nak buat business kan
ya cerita tu menarik tau because dia menunjukkan macam mana yes
so orang selalu tengok kan orang business ni at at the end of the success tau like the only the tip of the iceberg lah when ya and then macam kita pun jealous lah bila dia lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
even though macam belum kaya lagi but there every single day I woke up
even though I would say that sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself benda yang paling belajar is you need a good mentor
macam bila you bila you dah kaya ramai jer orang yang akan datang kan berpusu-pusu tapi basically kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul care ataupun just nak ride on us macam tu kan
ya that's the thing so cakap pasal tak kaya tapi means a lot sebab
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself adalah untuk selesaikan social issues like
ikut lah issue nya about environmental ke apa kan so because I do believe that in the in the in the keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan
kita perlukan orang buat business untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work lah kita pun tahu politician have so many other things kan tapi I would say that business kita boleh provide like kita boleh provide ya macam cakap lah kerja untuk orang kan kita boleh provide service diorang macam in your case you nak buat surprise delivery kan you boleh make people happy and so I would say that
instead of ya lah I used to work juga dulu kan dengan boss boss bukannya senang kan kita salah pun
kita salah memang confirm salah kita betul pun kita salah kan jadi macam ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age lah untuk
try error jatuh explore ya explore
jangan jangan berhenti terlalu cepat sometimes you didn't know macam awak tengok kan business business yang dah berjaya
that take years then even just take even one to two years lah yang one to two years ni bukannya entrepreneur dia grant-preneur sebab dia dapat duit daripada grant kan macam tu lah
tapi basically kan err orang perlukan at least six seven years untuk dia betul-betul ada strong base kan so if you stop too early
macam let's say kita nak makan durian kan even though we already see the buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita ambik pokok durian kan kita sibuk nak makan durian nak makan durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit kan it's not going to taste good even though you nampak hari-hari tapi you kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri
tapi the the biggest thing ialah perseverance untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening kan tapi
what kenapa apa what what what was
oh so itu adalah interesting part I would say that
he is a good actor tau so basically err sebenarnya kan bagus jer cerita start up ni walaupun dia letak satu lead actor yang teruk gila tapi basically dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang
lead actor pun dah terlalu superficial tau macam terlalu hebat so sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda
so walaupun awak tak tengok character nam do san tu sangat-sangat loser kan tapi basically that's how people at twenties macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu
compare to someone yang dah macam han ji pyeong yang dah thirties tau
so tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang production ni pun tak sangka dia akan backfire macam ni
sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada synopsis kan ada seorang mentor yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat han ji pyeong tapi because he is a good actor himself yang membuatkan
kita move dengan perasaan dia sampai kita sedangkan character tu tanpa tanpa interpretation daripada dia kan mungkin akan jadi character yang sangat annoying
harsh lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi because err the actor himself kan put so many emotions on the face
aiya many conflicts err conflicting emotions yang kita tahu yang he is not bad he is just
err mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati lah tapi when I think back and if I am mad at nam do san I would say that I'm mad at younger me juga
nonton suka hati kita lah kita nak suka siapa kan that is our own right tapi I would say it's a good reflection lah it's a good reflection
three years pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus that's the thing
sebab yang lain ada character development tau the other two friends tapi yang tu macam stay like just like that
ya just just better sikit lah ada coat sendiri tak payah pinjam that's the only improvement made kan kan tu lah aduh
okay ada lagi ke resolution untuk tahun ni anything eh untuk tahun ni
eh small thing seh yang buat benda jadi great and big ya
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya lah macam zaman study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute kadang-kadang boleh push you
like push you lah macam in the very last minute kan you boleh focus and sometimes your creative juice like macam tu kan tapi masalahnya in real life kan when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as err persekitaran lah environment macam tiba-tiba COVID dan sebagainya kan so macam
procrastination akan backfire you compare to someone belajar yang it's just you and your assignment lah macam tu kan
maybe because you are a person yang work under pressure
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you kena you kena combine kerja you dengan team mate lain like just imagine if the team mate buat macam tu to you kan at the last day baru dia nak submit dia punya
drag yourself ya betul betul betul procrastination
and somehow sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa lah procrastination ni pun
sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya social media juga kan macam in my own case lah I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video kan tiba-tiba another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so itu yang menarik then tu lah tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu kan ada tengok satu documentary tau dekat
documentary dekat Netflix ah cerita pasal social network tau macam mana sebenarnya since since kita guna all this services for free kan macam Facebook and all those thing kan basically we are
pelik ah sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah customer kan tapi kita tak bayar so tu maksudnya kita bukan customer maksudnya kita adalah
data err their their modal macam tu kan so
so dia dah baca tau kita punya behaviour dia dah baca kita punya interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so macam dia tahu macam mana nak keep us hook kita tengok one lepas satu-satu kan lagi satu aduh lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar
macam fikir fikir contoh kata oh rasa nak beli katil ah tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us lah kan our microphone is always on kita tak pernah pun default untuk tutup kan somehow
ya tapi maksudnya ya maksudnya kalau lah basically okay kalau diorang dengar diorang just feed us dengan ads okay lah tetap okay juga lah sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli kan but how about if bad people
so tu lah macam bila kita bila kita gunakan service ni for free kan for free
so kita basically menjual diri kita to them lah like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me sebab tu penting kita baca like agreements and all term and condition
macam tu lah like term and condition if you agree tick siapa pun nak baca tick kan kat situ that that's the thing
tapi takpe lah basically the basically the idea is walaupun kita tahu yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku at least kita tahu dia ambil so at least kita boleh jaga-jaga lah more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things kan macam tu
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now macam dulu kan like ten years back kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa that is something like ridiculously happened tau macam
kan kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita uh cik boleh tak saya tengok
err saya nak tengok apa periuk err dapur macam mana ada hood ke tak ada hood uh ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of of other person kan because that person boleh buat live dekat dia punya
bilik kan macam tu
ya ya even oh my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched dia siap tunjuk the secret room
and basically kan senangnya sekarang ni with the technology ada the semua kan dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik your plan house plan tau
hanya dengan gambar sekarang pun technology yang ada with with pictures you take pictures you can even like kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then macam nak masuk pun senang
yes and somehow this wealthy people pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan post so orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya rule dalam kita post social media ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh post pasal vacation after the vacation
yes sebab basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then curi lah apa saja
itu lah dunia sekarang different lah people
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing tau macam orang dulu kan dia communication nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu jer lah masa untuk interact tau so you really have to all out kan tapi people nowadays kan dia neglect
organik punya communication tapi dia boleh share every single thing about dia punya life kan tapi bila orang judge dia marah pula
orang tak like tak tak tak bagi reactions pun dia marah kan so
so okay cakap pasal tu that's there's one more lah one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution lah twenty twenty one oh my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day tau macam
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone tau so I was like macam I want to segment lah macam okay pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically kadang-kadang check tu actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then macam then all the video sometimes is err ridiculous err like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness kan so macam
so I want to segment lah macam okay dalam masa tiga jam ni I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it macam tu lah that's the idea
macam quota ah
oh you can ignore lah dia tak macam parental parental control yang terus off oh okay okay
just just to remind you lah bukan lah macam guru discipline something like that kan
tapi ada apps tau untuk buat benda tu which is very interesting I just download it lah macam nama dia forest tau so macam bila you start the apps kan you kena set lah you nak you nak buat kerja berapa lama
okay so dia ada beza tau tiga puluh minit dia punya shrub jer kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok tau kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah tau
so basically kan dia untuk bantu you untuk err focus so you buka app you set tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja kan so you tak boleh buka apps lain you kena tutup dengan apps tu sahaja
kalau lah tiga puluh minit you access your phone pokok tu akan mati tau tapi kalau kalau you kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan notify you okay pokok tu dah hidup and basically everyday you have a patch of forest untuk dibangunkan
yes very interesting so macam ah so macam basically kan dia bagi kita award macam dia bagi reward lah reward macam
okay so kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian
tak so depress
a'ah maksudnya
betul sebab manusia ni sukakan acknowledgement tapi takkan kita nak suruh ya yes
takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam kan it's just like boss datang okay congratulations four hours kan tak logic ah kan
that's very intriguing seh tu satu benda forest ada satu lagi tau interesting juga nama dia sleepy town so apa yang kita buat adalah err kita set lah satu hari kita nak tidur dalam enam jam kan so bila nak tidur kita buka apps tu dan tutup phone dengan apps tu on on running lah okay
so kalau you bangun dalam masa you dapat tidur tujuh jam ataupun you pasal you tak access phone dah lepas you dah set the alarm kan you akan bina the town
sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping lah so you will enjoy it when you so dia lebih daripada quality life lah so macam
interesting I ya lah saja jer nak tengok apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes I already sleep tau tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok phone sebab nak tengok sekejap jer end up kan
mula-mula jer yes end up Netflix tiba-tiba kan tiba-tiba so basically dia memang dia memang ada design untuk bagi orang hook
and tapi kita kena take back the power lah we have to unhook all that
ya yang peliknya dia bukan macam puppy tau yang macam memang sentiasa entertain anyone dia diva and then macam
make macam sangat-sangat annoying ah macam if if I need you rub me rub me now and when I don't like it I will just leave you macam tu kan
tu lah orang cakap kan macam bila kita bela kucing kita yang jadi servant to the cat
I think because they are cute tapi elegant
they they keep their eh I know tak lah macam cara dia tidur you know then oh tapi tak juga
tapi tapi ya cats can be very then sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam
ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang instead of bela anak kan maybe sebab bela binatang lebih bagus lah kot dari bela anak kan sebab bela anak ni
yeah maybe sometimes diorang investment so
macam tu lah
oh my god zombie apocalypse tapi agaknya okay lah ya zombie apocalypse tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa
I don't know I I have seen the video people cakap the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know lah tapi I would say apocalypse akan berlaku so be it zombie or not but still ah kata lah kalau that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers tau macam menarik ah orang yang boleh buat bunkers kat bawah rumah kan macam tu because you want to save save your family lah at least and sebab
tak payah tak payah zombie lah apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada food ration
and then at least ada survival skill kan let's say lah kalau berlaku
disasters kan actually zombie apocalypse akan leads kepada disaster ah dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah ah kan dan sebagainya kan so um kita kena ada survival skill
let's say kalau macam mana kita nak um menyorok kat mana kan ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab ya lah so far nak cakap pasal zombie ni kita tak tahu zombie tu macam mana
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see kan can only err listen ah macam tu kan so tak tahu cuma I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared lah kan
let's say kalau zombie semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang kan so kita kena
ah duduk dalam air kan betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air at least kita kena basic macam rafting ke apa macam tu kan
ya it's not zombie ah we call it bunk out bag dia macam
err bag tu ada cukup lah untuk something happened ada macam first aid macam ada dry food and then macam err your details pasal you punya your blood semua kan so macam kalau orang jumpa you terbaring ke apa you ni tapi kita panggil bunk out bag lah macam tu ya but kalau kalau kita cakap zombie kit tu orang akan rasa oh it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie kan but actually err disclaimer sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja jer lah it don't have to be zombie let's say lah kalau ada orang masuk rumah you yes war we don't we never know kan macam even though kita rasa everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year yang buatkan apa pun kita punya resolution tak tercapai tu kan so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so mmhmm
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it lah so macam tak tahu lah kalau macam overseas kan orang akan macam ada kan non disclosure kan macam tu tapi macam
I would say that berapa berapa probability dan possibility dia ah then macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya contractor tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana kan so macam boleh berlaku tapi I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous lah sebab maybe ah kan macam for now I would say that if we pun orang akan rasa oh this for safety
but for people yang macam influential kan let's say say it's um
ya kalau dalam movie kalau macam mafia ni kalau orang tu buat bunker untuk dia dia tembak jer lepas tu kan ah of course lah we cannot do that kan
cakap pasal rumah it's very interesting kan how ya people try to customise house kan macam buat secret room macam buat bunker and now people sekarang macam buat apa catio untuk kucing lah eh macam buat hub ya
cat is like social media ah hook you kan macam tu
and make them you know that's the thing err we call it like cat nourishment ah macam cats used to live in the wild tapi kita yang bring in the home kan so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is kejar rama-rama
things like that kan so that is tapi kalau ada rumah the first thing I want to have is swimming pool lah
seriously you want to hi and things waktu swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least bukan semua baka lah maybe some some breed can lah macam I would say bengal ke apa yang yang very wild one kan tapi basically kalau perasan semua kucing berenang most of them adalah yang short hair
ya instead of long hair ah macam tu sebab so kalau long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then tak dapat macam wiggle wiggle badan dia how dogs do it kan
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place untuk macam
buat yoga with all the sun you know because somehow kan kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then kita most of the time stay at home working at home and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D tau but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight kan so I was thinking kalau ada rumah kan in the middle of the house I want to make sure the dia punya dinding tu
um made from glass no no made from glass so dia dia dia
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight macam tu
like buat like igloo style so macam dok macam macam ni lah kubah macam tu
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive lah kan macam during this trying time kan macam ya every new year pun kita buat resolution kan pastu kita buat plans and everything because we want to look forward in life lah
macam and most of dreamers pun orang rasa macam crazy people in the beginning kan macam
macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik wright kan the the the wright brothers kan
macam when they want to fly things siapa jer yang setuju
tapi now that is diorang punya determination tu yang membuat we can cross country kan kita boleh experience things on the other side of the world
betul I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected lah dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat heavily affected
sebab ya lah diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak operate kan
oh tak boleh langsung ya then most people yang kerja dalam industry tu diorang adalah macam skillful people tapi in one area tau so diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain
ya that's interesting like paramedics pun boleh kan macam tu like basic basic ah menarik menarik so ya lah macam
because senang kan bila orang kena lay off ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena lay off sekarang sangat
dan somehow apart from dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan industry revolution industry kan bila everything's automated semua benda pakai robot pasal dia akan take away our jobs kan tiba-tiba kita berlaku economic punya macam ni yang yang merudum kan so
sebab itu lah kita buat business kot kan boleh lah bantu orang maybe provide more jobs to people kan sebab the economy have to run lah
ya because somehow dengan ramai orang kena laid off employer pun ada banyak sangat pilihan so the competition is very very high
macam tu kan
and cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada business kan lah
I would say that kesan besar kepada education system juga lah kan macam kids nowadays I would say sometimes bagus juga sebab orang dah mula adopt online learning sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan interactions
dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam universities kan some universities are err fully err fully on online platform kan
tapi bila kita dekat university kita bukannya hanya belajar theory dan kita punya subject tapi life lesson macam
kita belajar communicate kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi kan so all that adalah very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some sometime boleh juga bagi tapi I don't know how much the impact will be towards the character building
ya betul betul ya
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose kan tapi friends adalah orang yang you boleh choose ya kan so macam
you boleh choose and and boleh align minat dan sebagainya kan compare to ni then ya lah macam same eh macam peer kan macam same age peer sangat sangat penting untuk kita associate untuk kita faham
dan sebagainya so
ya akan jadi ada impact yang besar lah kepada characters building macam tu
ya just imagine before this pun graduates susah nak dapat kerja because
it's a very competitive market kan and now kita ada so many
err talented people kena laid off and compete together with them
ya macam dah lah nak compete each other pun dah hard enough and then kena compete lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun experience it's not going to be easy
tapi new economy pun akan terbuka lah macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi influencer kan sebab ya like influencer pun boleh give money
dah lama kan
cuma bahaya dengan being influencer ni sometimes they are not being human tau macam
and they ya and diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu social status yang sometimes unachievable kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar kan untuk bagi nampak abs nampak kurus sometimes it's just about angle
then people yang see that they didn't know pun itu adalah angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that sedangkan all that is just an illusion is a it is just an different angle kan camera trick that's the thing sometimes
dah lah tu lah jadi lebih mencabar lah kat kita punya youth kalau keadaan macam ni ya lah lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
ya even big brands pun sekarang dah start to work with influencers instead of artists yang memang buat art tau berkarya
okay lah somehow artist people diorang charge memang terlalu mahal kan and influencers dia ada dia ada bigger fan base
ya faham
dan artist dan actress ni dia terpaksa produce something dulu kan baru orang boleh look up to them kan compared to influencer ni
pergi makan pun orang suka kan pergi jogging pun orang suka kan so macam cuma tu lah kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh set unrealistic thing ah
so fuh banyak juga kita borak ni kan daripada start dengan resolution cerita pasal zombie apocalypse dan sebagainya so ya hopefully takpe lah yang penting kita start sekarang buat sekarang macam
ya boleh
untuk family ah untuk family err I would say that more collaborations macam
ya lah before this I would say that I live on my own lah pun duduk macam jauh kan so macam
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal kan tapi I want this family to be more collaborative like masak sama-sama
buat kerja sama-sama and even though macam ya lah adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one kan even though of course lah macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah kan tapi basically ah but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
kadang-kadang macam ya lah kita pun kena bergerak sebagai family
betul how about you apa yang you uh foresee for as a family punya movement
aduhai okay lah
ya ya ya hopefully lah macam and it don't have to be far pun but at least places that we can
okay jom rasanya
boleh lah kan kita start put in the planner ataupun buat vision board kan letak dekat dalam semua lawa-lawa kan and satu benda lagi it's good tau actually bila kita tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us lah
ya because when we say it kan tak ada lah nanti at the end takkan lah nanti at the end of the year nanti macam eh apa jadi dengan macam tu kan so macam
aku dah tak pergi gunting rambut sangat lah macam aku lost

mm ada lah
ke january is it
ya tapi I mean aku still contact aku still contact kau I still contact you on on on mm
do a lot of things lah but macam
I mean tak lah aku betul juga now now that you now that you mention about err last time when we were in school we
sekarang aku baru ingat balik actually ya lah actually quite true lah macam aku used to
primary school aku dulu kat katong punya area kan then
then there was macam a lot of
macam drains ada banyak longkang-longkang besar
so that time tengah primary school tengah pendek kecil kan so like
after school nanti main bawah longkang masuk bawah longkang then keluar dekat lagi satu punya longkang punya area keluar kat luar jer kan
that kind of thing so a'ah lah betul juga lah so I think
wow jauh eh actually wow hougang sampai bukit batok jauh seh
park connectors dia tampines
ya it's from tampines to pasir ris like a shortcut bagi pergi ya main basikal so
so far if kalau pergi jauh-jauh aku tak pernah aku tak pernah realize seh
ya dah ada ya dah ada
to from sun plaza park sun plaza park yang belakang
ah terus jalan terus connect to
connect to ah pasir ris lah it's a shortcut masuk pasir ris
ada ada ada err actually actually tampines street forty five yang belakang is actually connecting
dia actually connected to connected to bedok bedok reservoir err then
nowadays my school is only err usually now is only four days sahaja
now at this age nothing much to do lah so ya quite sian lah like macam like
I thought macam I thought like I thought
macam like seven eleven jobs is easy to get kan but
to work somewhere in uh plaza singapura lah plaza singapura then I can err it's
second they called me they say which ah which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza singapura then
they send my resume to plaza singapura then
they have a different way of macam approaching things lah they
people have more macam people are more more polite lah bila I talk to people
macam really down to earth they they know
east coast apa tu
aku suka pergi oh
I mean aku aku aku not the outdoor outdoor ke type of person lah aku aku tak suka
macam aku aku
err aku tak suka kotor-kotor lah aku tak suka pasir-pasir you know pasir-pasir then
memang best lah kotor-kotor ah but macam the next
day macam hari hari kemudian macam
bila time pagi nak balik you know nak balik nak kena
nak kena mandi nak kena
nak kena bersihkan pasir-pasir you know that kind of thing habis dengan
pagi-pagi buta rambut tak shampoo all that macam aku tak macam
aku tak suka outdoor punya benda because of that sahaja lah aku
oh I mean ah ya lah I think ah aku rasa it's a macam macam macam ah
apa ni self esteem dalam melayu apa eh macam
pendirian diri ah eh bukan bukan lah I don't know what lah sudah macam like
self esteem lah aku
will affect my choices macam aku will affect aku punya
err whether aku nak ikut kau orang pergi east coast overnight ke tak
so kalau aku ikut kau orang pergi east coast and aku nak overnight aku nak kena
nak kena pack barang-barang aku semua lah like like
like I've to make sure aku ada ini ada itu ada ini so besok aku will feel
maybe mungkin it's a mungkin it's a penyakit ah I don't know lah but ya lah
ya I think I think I think betul juga ah apa yang kau cakap macam like um
macam let's say macam main dekat rumput main dekat rumput kadang-kadang I mean aku
aku punya mind kan aku dah fikir pasal rumput tu kan
nanti automatic kan automatically aku punya kaki gatal sendiri tau macam
suddenly aku dah rasa dia punya gatal dia macam pasal aku
macam betul-betul ada ada betul-betul betul-betul rumput ini akan menggatalkan kaki aku lah then aku
straightaway kaki aku dah rasa gatal dulu macam
aku rasa ada something ah macam tangan aku pun kalau tangan aku
macam ada sweaty palms ah berpeluh
kalau kalau kalau aku tak fikir pasal apa-apa apa-apa eh
dia okay tau tapi bila time aku
nak start buat kerja something ke apa eh
bila time aku dah start dekat depan computer aku nak fikir lama jer kan
aku rasa straightaway tangan aku berpeluh tau so macam
dia ada effect juga ah macam
aku rasa anxiety problem ah macam
macam oh aku kena habiskan kerja ni
masa tempoh ni then straightaway aku punya otak aku dah fikir oh
dah ada macam jadi rasa takut lah
oh jadi
itu lah asyik berbual pasal aku jer daripada tadi
aku tanya pasal engkau pula lah
ya lah I mean itu lah I mean cause sekarang umur kau berapa
sudah forty kan oh ya itu lah I mean
lagi twenty ah haiya I I don't know lah macam
aku tak boleh look forward lah I mean but ya lah
cepat lah one masa berlalu very fast lah to me like my masa
a lot dah tukar lah I mean a lot of a lot of changes lah dulu singapore dulu dengan singapore sekarang kan macam a lot of changes lah cara
makin laju everything became became faster
then macam everybody rushing then macam like
aku feel last time was more um
ke time lockdown eh time lockdown I uh lockdown period I think
mm takut tak lah I mean
ya actually aku actually I I thought of that also lah I mean I I already
you know I I I decided to macam I came to
it's not something you can like belek here belek there and like go
and not get caught or what macam
ya betul ah eh I remember I remember those times lah macam
err hopeless lah you feel quite sad lah like like like macam like
macam going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship lah like
ya that one ya lah betul lah I mean I feel like macam
ah lah there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of macam views on that lah macam like
will say different things lah macam
like nature nature telling us something ke apa you know that kind of thing so
itu lah we just have to make the best of it lah
ya lah but sekarang I mean um ya definitely macam that time aku baca dekat news
aku baca dekat uh yahoo news that macam a lot of a lot of deejays yang main
a lot of like uh house deejays I mean like resident deejays yang main dekat macam
dekat fullerton dekat you know dekat
ya ya all the deejays yang spin
semua most of them out of job lah habis
from earning like macam like
like food online or online or macam food delivery online then
bars and all that lah macam whatever that has music ah
actually macam counter that thing yang is actually can survive and
ah ah if you're comparing macam like music eh audio and video right
uh right now video is important lah macam there's more video jobs like for internship like more video jobs err
ya lah so sometimes I feel like macam
would have been different lah but but ya lah macam nasib ah
mm betul itu lah that's why that's why right now
I mean ada macam I I got my school
so actually I feel honestly right now aku feel like macam want to give up lah because
macam there's no more industry there's no no more music industry right then
then I'm like in year three trying to finish my diploma in audio then macam I feel like sometimes
like want to give up lah pasal like like
you know of of course there's still macam online streaming all that lah cuma
you know netflix you know netflix sekarang they have err all the singaporean movies
everything is on the Netflix right now you know then like macam
oh is it oh tak ya ya all the way lah right now right now all the all the old singapore movies is on

weeks tak tak silap aku ada lagi satu engineer engineer ah engineer baru masuk engineer dia engineer baru ni masuk dia sekali pandang kau aku memang tahu lah dia ni engineer dia pun dari india juga ah
pasal the the the funny thing is
masuk site office eh dia duduk kat tempat yang aku duduk yang aku tidur tu
so he literally
took up my my my place ah kirakan dia macam ibarat ganti aku ah
so aku
at first bila dia dia datang like
the first few days dia masuk aku tak berbual dengan dia sangat ah pasal aku tak tahu dia engineer as in aku tahu dia engineer he was part of the company is an
employee of the company tapi aku didn't know his background so hari-hari ah
ah so hari-hari aku datang office aku tengok dia pun dia pun macam aku time baru masuk dia datang office duduk office pun duduk
so aku pun aku tanya dia ah I ah pasal
ah kita attachment semua kita nak kena err put up a report apa kita punya own individual report
so aku
ah aku pun need someone to to to give me some input ah like all these technical technical details apa kita buat apa benda yang bangla bangla
dia orang yang tengah bikin apa benda yang dia orang tengah bikin so I need someone to explain to me ah so aku tahu dia ni engineer he's part of the company tapi dia pun tak ada kerja dia pun macam aku
aku tanya dia lah aku just take the opportunity ah aku tanya excuse me are you an engineer
so that explains a lot lah kenapa dia dia macam aku duduk lepak aje tak sebab dia punya project belum start lagi so that's why the the company
I asked him to to come over to this project first sambil tunggu the his project start lah
so aku
dengar gitu aku like okay ah aku punya mind macam terus ada light bulb ah okay bagus ah aku boleh boleh apa
ah minta tolong dia untuk aku punya report ah individual report ah
terus aku aku korek ah help me tell me what is this explain to me what is that gini semua abeh dia dia bilang ah
abeh after that day onwards pun
err dia dengan aku sekaki ah err err dia pun selalu come let's go let's go out jalan-jalan err pergi keluar jalan-jalan pun ni ah jadi orang tak tak
tak tengok kita tak buat apa-apa ah ah
asal tak tidur dekat sana ada got some certain days certain days we kita ada tidur kat kat ah kat tempat situ kadang-kadang pasal we did an upgrading project in a apa
kadang-kadang pun kita ah apa jalan-jalan dalam sekolah dia kita tidur dalam classroom that was during the holidays lah so the school was empty ah
kirakan err the
dekat site eh
yang paling tinggi is only the project manager lah and project manager that time aku punya project manager perempuan so ah she also
err wasn't the the macam mana nak cakap eh ah
there there are some ladies who are macam rude ah dia orang dia orang can do both the office work and the site work tapi yang that time aku punya internship my project manager she was more of the office type lah
so dia duduk office aje ah kalau higher ups ni semua ah dia orang jarang datang site
at most pun dia orang datang ah apa once err
dia orang pun tak akan dia orang pun tak akan macam err
ya probably they want kalau dia orang pergi site pun nak tengok progress you won't go into
macam dalam-dalam ah dia orang setakat jalan dekat tepi tengok oh okay ini dah siap ini dah bangun ini dah bikin dia orang tak akan masuk like literally masuk
aku so the good thing the the engineer came aku minta dia tolong so like
aku pun help to update my my weekly report
okay lah aku
uh one good thing pun aku pun like have to be smart also lah macam aku pun tahu office orang semua
cakap aku aku datang pun tak buat apa-apa kan so bila bila this engineer dah datang aku dah dapat dia tolong uh aku punya report
so bila-bila aku nak kena bikin report aku buat dalam office ah I mean that's the only place also yang aku boleh buat apa
that's like like that's that's the only setting yang kau boleh buat kerja apa
so ada juga lah there's there's where other engineer pun start to notice ah wah dia ni ada juga ah bikin ni bikin ni buat ni semua pasal like a few weeks later ada lagi satu budak
attachment masuk
ah budak attachment ah
dia pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office pasal it's just like a very ah small ah small office
so hari-hari kau datang office eh kita masuk kita punya site office sebelum masuk kau nak kena buka kasut kau ah
so satu hari tu aku aku macam biasa report late to work
aku sampai office aku tengok kat luar pintu
pasal kau dah hari-hari datang office kau dah kau dah cam ah kau dah cam ah ah

dia dia the good thing untuk aku aku ada orang cover aku the office boy
like you have to make you use you have to network ah you have to network you had to make connections tapi dia ni dia ni tak ada connections langsung ah ah
ah office boy approach tapi language barrier juga ah
apa dia pun in his own world even the the other engineers
the malaysian chinese enigineers pun dia orang pun cakap dia ni
apa dia ni tak boleh ah dia ni buat hal sendiri
apa so so that's that's the thing ah
that was my experience lah for my for my attachment so it was from that experience yang aku tengok
eh siala rabak apa aku tengok the working environment macam it's so stressful aku tengok the the engineer yang dari india tu kiwak muka dah macam zombie
tapi untuk aku ya aku was just a student apa so aku just report to work like the usual like eight thirty to six something like that lah aku macam mana pun
pukul enam aku chao ah pasal they they don't really have have anything much for me apa tapi like those engineers like
dia orang after six pun dia orang still
err ya so abeh aku tengok like the work environment macam
semua orang buat hal sendiri macam not much interaction
like ya it's true err aku can understand they don't take me seriously and aku pun wasn't expecting them to take me seriously ah aku kau cakap gini pun aku teringat ada satu kali tu it was the first tak silap aku the first day ah the first day
aku report to to to aku apa attachment
so kan aku bilang kau apa ni err
everyone was so busy pasal they have a meeting so after that err they all left for the meeting
aku aku seorang aje ah dalam office
aku seorang dalam office sekali alih-alih ada satu orang masuk dalam office
dia pun tengok aku dia tengok aku err tak
tak kenal aku pe macam dia ni siapa siol abeh tanya oh who are you aku cakap attachment student oh attachment student abeh dia tanya aku err singaporean ah ya singaporean
dia dia dengar singaporean terus dia straight talk direct direct punya siol
you singaporean why you take this course singaporean where where want to work in construction one work under the hot sun work under the hot sun ini semua gedebak gedebuk kiwak aku dengar terus down siol serious aku dengar terus down
tapi ah ah tapi ya lah apa that was
I was still young ah you you you didn't really understand it lah tapi bila dah lama kau dah ini kau dah kerja kau dah in the industry eh
so apa ya so
after the experience aku was like siala gini rabak pe err
so err err lepas bila aku tu tu yang aku pun make me
fikir ah I like aku betul like sial ah betul ke nak kerja err construction industry rabak gini
tapi at that at that at that time pun macam abeh kalau aku tak nak kerja construction industry pun aku nak kerja apa sia
abeh aku fikir-fikir abeh aku dah belajar ambil diploma ni pun dah dah dah tiga tahun takkan nak
okay lah cakap dengan diri
aku even though aku
aku still don't know what to do with my life since aku already have this diploma which already err took up three years of my life okay lah I just just might as well take up a job
aku ya aku applied for
which I applied ah ni I applied the stat boards public utilities board ni semua so okay lah alhamdulillah err within one or two weeks they get back to me and aku got the job quite quite fast ah
um ya apa time aku
ya bila aku dapat kerja pun like
pasal like err when I join the company
then they because it's a big company apa so they have this apa induction course ah
it's no longer your your your age age age group ah so you meet all kinds of people lah abeh abeh jumpa abang-abang ni semua apa
oh engkau umur berapa
ah ya ya around your age ah oh muda lagi ni kau punya ni kau punya ah first kerja aku cakap a'ah
oh apa kau patut
err muda-muda patut kerja luar dulu kerja private apa rasa dia punya susah payah dulu err kau dah kau dah tahu dia punya susah payah baru kau masuk
baru kau masuk err
government state board ni semua you know lah because they see government iron rice bowl which is true lah definitely I I won't I won't a dispute that ah
and uh so when they when they say that aku pun like eh
alamak aku pun did I make the right move ke tak eh err err like
you were saying ah kau
a fresh fresh graduate baru baru baru baru graduate ini semua kau patut
err kirakan start from the bottom ah start from scratch
bila aku happy kerja
and aku pun so it it gave me like
err doubts lah aku pun like
did I make the right move ke tak eh
tapi I mean
apa it doesn't really matter also lah
just went along lah abeh macam
aku pun fikir balik like
err ya what he say really err apa like
ah tak bedek ah but
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks ah abeh aku pun fikir balik macam sial ah aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak resign oh just
because aku nak nak nak listen to that guy kan
uh apa uh
I mean apa you
you just made do with what you have ah you just make do with what you have memang betul
apa the the at that at that time my my nature of work
err apa
it didn't turn out quite that bad also pasal
macam you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants ah so
abeh err from
from aku punya nature of work pun project management pun what what I
back then pun aku wasn't really a
a a apa ni I'm
I am a very quiet guy lah aku not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
so so ya you aku aku
improve on my soft skills and then dekat err during my course of work pun there like what I told you ah who decided to further my studies take up
like I told you before lah apa aku time ambil degree pun was like
doing a degree I should also do a degree tapi
uh aku was just following the trend ah tapi now now aku fikir balik I shouldn't have do that lah I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
and uh what you really want to do ah pasal that time
apa err
since you say it like that pada aku in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in ah so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay um which I agree lah which a degree is not really ah apa a need ah
when aku did my degree uh
err aku did my degree while while working kan abeh as years go by eh
aku kat kerja aku like
aku tengok aku punya sama ah like
work environment pun
aku tell myself sial ah aku aku aku don't see myself
aku tengok aku punya bosses eh like
macam err
dia orang ada takde pun macam beza sia
like they are just like pasal okay
organisation kan like ya we have a apa like uh
tapi stat board they call it lah
when kau pun pun you should know ah kan hierarchy ah it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like abeh macam
kau kat bawah eh macam
tak boleh buat decision abeh kau nak kena
err lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena
abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu decision orang atas dia lagi
I mean kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka
like apa sia ni like
kau orang err kau orang cannot make a decision abeh aku nak kena buat apa siol
bertahun-tahun lepas punya sia
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like eh siala kau orang dari dulu eh abeh sampai sekarang
more like pada aku it's not healthy ah abeh abeh macam aku like kat situ eh aku kerja situ like siala macam aku kalau stay sini aku tak nak sia end up macam kau orang ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true ah aku
dispute it lah apa err government really iron rice bowl lah as in like
but aku just don't see myself doing that long term ah
to to change line ah aku decided to go into aku wanted to do media so
err after my apa ni err my degree ended
aku graduated
aku took out a course dekat mediacorp
at first aku didn't know about it also like as in I I do
ah apa sebelum aku enroll under mediacorp
ya I I did some I did some research ah of courses of media courses ah apa that's where aku like macam aku menyesal lah siala like instead of me doing this degree in project management I should have like straightaway
it's good lah it's good lah uh so aku was like err apa siala aku tahu dulu aku
and then apa that was
this school ah aku dah aku dah lupa ah nama sekolah dia ke something like that it was it is it closed down already ah
ah something like that ah aku pun dah lupa ah
then apa ni so aku just still err
to go ahead with it aku look up ada ada aku aku just look up on google lah of of ah media courses ah abeh aku fikir balik ah macam
aku baru habis aku punya part-time degree aku did my part-time degree for five years
aku dah like that five years eh aku pun like like like macam in a way like macam drag myself to to finish it ah
abeh err
lepas tu aku sekarang nak go into media industry kalau aku nak ambil degree aku nak kena
aku was like siala five years of study dah dah macam dah cukup ah like ah enough of studying ah sia ah enough of studying ah I mean
ah abeh
aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak take up another degree
another three years of degree for media abeh aku just look out aku tengok mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma ah it's just a one year course okay lah one year aku cakap dengan dia okay lah masih boleh take it lah one year okay lah so I I I I grabbed it ah
then err aku pun
transition into the media industry kan so aku like thought of err maybe err take a gap year first ah before aku joined the media industry
so uh apa aku
was planning to take my gap year which was this year aku uh already plan to go to new zealand
a working holiday if you heard of it ah basically I basically it's it's a holiday tapi ah
kau boleh you can apply for a job there
but ah but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs lah it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs ataupun part-time jobs are those kind of jobs ah ya ah so
so err apa ni err
kalau there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
pasal ah their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they make use of this err apa ni err backpackers foreigners to come to to to err holiday
and err at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday apa so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry ah so aku
aku dah plan ah aku dah book aku apa flight semua aku dah aku dah err dah dapat dah visa aku dah apa ni err aku dah apply deferment pun untuk aku punya
semua dah settle semua dah swee tinggal nak
nak ni je nak naik flight jer
ya I mean it's it's it's predictable lah apa aku punya kerja pula aku nak kena bagi one month notice so err apa ah
aku decided to like literally ah resign err one month before aku punya flight ah aku tak nak resign too early pasal aku pun need the money lah
I have over there apa
so aku pun decided to like just err retire one month before my flight
aku was seriously like the the suspense eh was like wow like only
apa err
when the news all broke out oh apa COVID
ni semua apa ah
at first macam the whole the whole world were were singing praises for singapore oh singapore have their best system they have the best ini itu ini semua gedebak gedebuk tapi aku dalam hati macam okay lah aku harap that like
err maybe err new zealand they dia orang like closed one eye on singapore because
kononnya singapore have a very good system in controlling the the virus they will still allow err err visitors to come over lah
sekali but unfortunately that
did not happen ah aku punya
ah apa
ah three weeks before my flight ah so at that time when they announced that aku dah already tender my notice aku dah resign pun
ah abeh like fuck man at that time like siala macam damn when when when that news came out eh aku rasa macam like like rasa macam bodoh ah like ah
not really cheated macam
ya ya ya err abeh macam
betul lah I mean
it's not my fault tapi like I really felt stupid at that time ah macam damn like like aku like aku pun dah bilang err aku punya boss semua like aku didn't like literally at my workplace inform all my colleagues oh I'm going new zealand ni semua like macam macam excitingly like break the news to them ah
aku like just keep it to myself lah tapi of course dengan aku punya boss aku nak kena bilang dia apa aku aku nak resign ni semua
abeh boss aku pun of course they they dia orang pun tanya aku kau betul ke nak resign apa ah
at that time pun pernah tanya aku if aku nak reconsider ke tak resignation aku aku cakap tak ah aku still want to go ahead
he respect my decision ah dia cakap okay ah this is your decision I fully respect your decision if you really want to go you just go ahead lah okay lah so when the news broke out that new zealand they close the borders aku like fuck man like siala ah
dah aku dah tender aku punya resignation abeh semua dah dah dah settle flights semua dah settle logistics semua settle
habis sekarang tak jadi eh aku dah then err the the other things that came into my mind ni ah sekarang macam mana takde kerja takde kerja abeh like

apa like
at that time was like really down ah really down abeh ah
aku didn't work for four months

oh okay so korang dua ni macam very entrepreneur eh leh
kira bagus juga they will you try things tapi bawakan
bawakan duit eh bring him bringing in the money so
okay korang save duit untuk apa sebenarnya
bagus lah bagus lah entrepreneur I I'm quite surprised eh it's only quite also and
um nak cakap apa tu heartened lah I'm heartened to see that you are doing this
ya so lepas apa tu
I asked around lah I said how to go for audition right untuk apa ni how to start theatre how to do theatre
eh no no I didn't go audition I attend the workshop first it was a free workshop on sunday kat sub station so then lepas tu ya lah every week I go attend workshop I do I learn about acting
and then apa tu uh one day like uh my first appearance on stage was as a human prop
somehow they get somebody cause kita free kan they get us to just lie there
like in the middle of the show lah before intermission one of the character cakap what the character say macam oh who is this you know then after that reveal lah so like wah a dead body
until the end everybody dah balik
but ya lah because cannot cannot move what so my kaki semut semut you know
but then kaki semut semut you cannot move right so you need to learn macam your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise yang how hard it was until um they got a review lah somebody wrote a review then cakap
complain lah they complain banyak banyak about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
cakap about the best potrayal was the portrayal
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing bila I think got this one uh kakak melayu
orang rupanya so she was like she was surprised yang she so she was shocked lah to realise actually I was a real person lah so okay
um mula mula so not wrapped ah macam dorang ada cover dengan kain gitu ah
ah no no no no no as in so dia macam apa tu
my there will be a set kan kat belakang tu ada macam ada the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me lah ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that lah so I
so my leg actually boleh lah my leg can move but then err just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
um then no we were like training what we wanted macam training then after that apa tu um second show I was
stage managing I was helping and then after that um the actor problem lah tak tak selalu tak datang lah apa tu hangover lah blah blah blah then after that the director cakap
there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just apa tu um can you just
and then my director macam wah I never knew you can act eh so then she text me then say okay then next time um can you take over his role lah because he's very problematic
but simpan tak
actually itu ah what is influencer
ya actually it's true ah that time where I so geram you know pasal apa tu I got I was trying to promote one of the my programs lah when I was doing coordinating work right I was coordinating apa tu um
her Facebook posts one Facebook post and one Instagram post ya and itu pun bukannya dia macam uh she write any oh no
she actually she wrote something but dia punya her posts were so funny because
the after that post is very hard to track whether apa tu yang the
your your press conference eh no press kit no bukan apa
apa lah
your post bukan they put on theirs right
is it like some of the comments dorang cakap apa
mm mm habis
tak tidur ah kau
tu pun kirakan macam apa tau macam branding kan
eh apa tu number
company apa nak buat uh
what have you thought about apa tu your branding about your selling point eh apa ni bising bising
tu lah oi
perlahan-lahan sikit boleh tak ai okay okay okay tak apa um
kecoh lah okay patut boleh quiet tapi dorang semua
company okay you wanted to sell apa tu nak jual buka kedai
can jangan lupa nak kena code switch sikit eh nak kena code switch melayu okay
bagus lah bagus lah so ah it's
selling marketing tu yang paling the difficult at the moment actually nak buat
one person said to me lah nak apa tu kalau nak
nak buat business senang
cuma nak sustain tu ya nak sustain
apa yang orang nak orang pun semua macam very fickle
hmm what do you mean tak faham
orang yang bayar ya
dia punya dia punya sense orbit lah the fashion sense
not bad so siapa yang jual I mean siapa yang buat
where you manufacture you jahit sendiri
pandai mana kau dapat suruh contact contact sebegini
kena ajar juga eh sometimes okay
but from dari kecil from growing up you really wanted to do this ah
apa lah tak apa
engkau memang yes
apa apa yang cons dia
mati cepat in in what sense
apa car crash eh apa uh plane crash
apa apa juga pun kalau dah ajal like what you say lah
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay lah is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a um apa doktor badut dorang panggil um
no lah I think growing up I very you cannot decide lah nowadays also I also think about it kita we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
power ranger then I was like okay lah boleh lah power ranger but you know
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist pasal my gigi berterabuh
my gigi I think fall down and then uh I all of my front teeth semua macam
hitam tau like pasal I think it it was chipped and then after that ada ada darah stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
I think it was because I was sick then I realise ugh you know what if only I can become a doctor and then um I just got the idea from a lot people lah one thing I wanted to become scientist also pasal that time pergi madrasah then after that my ustazah cakap apa
err kalau ada lalat tu kan lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul
kepak dia tu kan satu one side kepak dia ada uh
what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other punya kepak tu ada
dia punya antidote penawar dia the medicines I want to say who ah I I'm curious ah
which side of the of the kepak of the lalat tu yang mana satu toxic yang mana satu what
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I kena punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
so dia cakap macam eh macam cool eh korang apa ni what you do performance and I enjoy that lah but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
pasal to get into medicine here at that time ah for me you need to get straight four A's
geram seh but anyway ya
so ya lah and err I remember my teacher you know mister yaz telling me to like eh bila ya lah where are you going to
just drop one subject lah just drop one subject because they were they care so much about apa ni dia punya school punya standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible lah so ya but then in the end I just decided to
this person tak boleh ajar ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say eh you are actually quite good ah uh
ya tapi tu tu show ada banyak problem seh
but the problem also not not not related to me lah pasal dia punya management lah they don't know how to sell the show they making lots of money even now you know a lot of people uh some of the
macam last time also I was pakai fikir apa tu alah nak buat like I always have this embarrassment tau kalau everytime kita buat show kan
how much to sell the tickets for then when you sell ticket alamak macam too much lah too expensive lah like I don't think people will want or like cannot afford cannot afford because we will we care about
the uh apa tu
bila kita calculate the budget
cannot it doesn't make sense we are losing in the end in the end we are not even err we are actually give it like say as if it's charity because we where we pay for other stuff we have to pay macam
you'll get loss lah rugi ah
okay noted tiga puluh minit oh wow
cannot decide ah kalau makanan makanan nak kena lit ah
dia teh tarik is always my actually I'm addicted to teh tarik it cannot kalau tak ada tak ada the teh tarik cannot
like even kalau
kat india okay lah not bad ah that time I was in bangalore
dorang kan ada dorang punya apa tu yang masala chai so and things like that so okay lah itu kelakar because
kecil kecil so I always like tak cukup I have to keep on buying and buying and buying later so in the end I came I said oh I saw they have this bigger cup for other drinks ah terus cakap can I have
boleh because dia dia tak ada the pricing tau for that thing so they just like anyhow give me a price so I said I don't mind then the next day I said even that not enough I brought my own water bottle I want your masala chai in my water bottle
chai just means tea that's why when we play scene when you when you say chai tea eh siapa tu
oh kita pause
kejap as we pick up some delivery
okay sambung balik
banyak distraction lah delivery lah
kau punya phone jangan mati eh dia okay ah
apa aku cakap oh ya okay lah so I think kalau makanan what favourite food I will eat
okay lah kalau drink teh tarik kalau makanan I don't know
I like nasi ambeng but I don't think I can eat nasi ambeng hari hari
buat selama-lamanya mm oh maybe okay lah kalau okay kalau nak fikirkan right I think
if I were to really strategise it something yang healthy
I don't know maybe protein shake ah not protein shake lah the one the one yang ada all the all the meals like
it's for survival dia macam okay you remember you watch matrix you know the yang dorang makan benda apa benda tu
then the guy was saying like um they were in the they were in a vessel uh but then after that they will makan some like some bubur or like porridge ke apa benda
dia cakap oh this is all this is everything that you need for your health that thing ah
um nasi ambeng maybe uh I don't know
for lunch nasi ambeng ah maybe something else
okay let's see what other prompts dorang kasi
promosi oh promosi beli satu percuma satu apakah yang paling teruk okay
ya lah maksudnya kalau macam
eh kau kan dulu kecil kecil ada belajar tu
hmm apa benda tak elok
dia ada batin batin ada dia kan ada kat masjid en-naeem kan
like that you bilang you bilang ibu ah
tengok ah
I also not so sure pasal to me dia macam nampak macam dancing
haven't melayu semua melayu silat
apa tak explain sikit
buka bunga apa open open flower open flower
so it's about really respect lah adat adat adat
okay then kalau martial arts what martial arts you want to learn
apa eh
the flying the flying arm bar I remember dia ajar macam mana nak buat flying arm bar
ni masih uni ah I think because
doing merepek-merepek stuff
because I did I do film school right so he study apa tu
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps ah then I okay then aku more to learn lah then he show me a flying arm bar
ya ya ya so macam mana I got the video ah choreo but I remember it was uh
like ya ya so you you hook on to the tangan and then after that one of the kaki will
ya gitu sekali banyak kali ah that move actually they look a lot dekat apa tu what a lot of the fightings sequences lah that kind of hollywood
pasal okay so now eh do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know uh I was baca lah pasal okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you ah kalau macam all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend ah think of uh somebody you jumpa every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person tanya okay ayisha uh can I uh macam stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
eh oh okay gitu jer eh
kalau an asker
they know dorang tahu yang apa tu if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
two weeks macam
not as lama lah but they will say like how how could this person even
how dare they ask me like that question asal dia tak fikir pasal so there's a lot of like issues that come with it pasal
you either macam
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks dia macam kurang ajar lah very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
got the hull invert um because they think like ada
but for so that's a point on guesser lah so I realised kita
there's a yes or no um people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why ah apa motive kau eh what is it for faham tak
um macam for example lah
uh oh aku perasan apa yang you leave your
that that apa tu yang
if it is a western country I think boleh lah
but they don't understand apa tu yang
uh dorang tak faham
impian eh
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk apa ni
it's okay sekiranya anda harus menyerah segala-galanya bagi mengejar impian anda apakah yang akan anda risikokan malay>kau ni melayu dia
ah aku tahu melayu tak we don't speak like that what
wait kalau kita cakap bahasa melayu kan
pasal maybe
I okay this is what I learn lah melayu yang kita belajar dekat sekolah is not
is not the melayu
in conversation melayu ah
siapa seh cakap macam gitu
tapi no actually okay kita
I mean I I got ada kawan I do speak melayu tau I do speak malay with um
uh cuma with the bahasa the like the language yang bahasa melayu yang kita pakai
ah no no kita tak pakai bahasa baku pun kita pakai bahasa I don't know they call it bahasa pasar ke but they is like
macam mana like it's not
it's not the language yang kita belajar in school
then I also wonder kita belajar bahasa tu dari mana
there see that guy macam that guy is the singapore social guy kan then she she was like
shu shu is my err my ex-colleague the one that is now working for berita harian as the
reporter actually the other day I I forgot lah that kak ain kan she just macam she just err wrote a new book right the java enigma
then after that she got the I err I was talking to her then like dia dapat the interview dengan berita harian right err
taking scraps ah from her colleagues so like quite I forgot about dia for a bit
oh ya anyway next time macam you kalau dengar like any like cool people or stories or people to interview ah just let me know ah then at least she has something to write about
okay so katakan dia is like twenty four twenty one years old twenty one years old
masih you will still consider
abang she's twenty one this year and you are twenty nine this year
katakan lah I I know someone who is twenty one years old this year and
anyway I was talking to kakak the other day she was asking whether she want to
belum but she she did tell me macam
err dia no lah dia ada make like ada make video lah like when she
um okay lah it's very big then dia ada macam err dua balconies two balconies
based on macam the video I saw it was macam dua dua balconies
I was talking to her then on the day yang err
kakak was err just mengumpat pasal dia punya
err mak mertua as per usual lah the usual err
topic of conversation between mummy kakak and the madrina
ya so then mummy was saying macam kakak is
the what's that anak mertua yang biadap I think that was the exact words err
that is a mm adjective to to describe kakak
but anyway err um remember kakak I was asking kakak when she
err celebrate hari raya in her current house
or celebrate hari raya in the next house because
eh no it should be may it should be may cause this year's hari raya was err dua puluh empat
I remember the hari raya was
dua puluh empat or dua puluh enam I think that was the
that was the official hari raya punya date
no lah as in just kakak was asking me lah macam mana cause
like kasi orang jalan jalan raya lah to her house
ya ya ya I I remember is the one yang abang yan dengan yang abang yan datang then he
yes yes is that is that one that one yang dia err minta kakak izin like err
kakak kata okay lah obviously but kakak was like cause what cause kakak couldn't say macam
no tak boleh datang kau tak boleh datang besok but like kakak was like okay
kenapa ni nak datang then I remember mum was saying macam dia tak ada barang tak ada benda lain tak buat apa
then macam why why then mum was telling the story of how he always goes to people's houses
ah ya ya I heard that he's doing it and cik anis is also doing it right was it
how old is abang yan again
suka hati eh abang just panggil orang gay eh
sangat deep
macam best sangat ke
bagus sangat ke ah ugh it doesn't happen in
there's macam everybody is more free and liberal in
for right okay I know that kalau you nak masuk kalau you nak dapatkan the hostel room right
yang the korean punya show yang dia orang taruk the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
kejar them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
like other celebrities have to chase them and cari I believe they have to pull the name tag off lah
she like it was very popular so I remember me and kakak we were saying that
but last time dia punya zaman also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball dengan football T-shirt
last time we used to have this err music teacher kat bowen ah his name was err mister jamal
like professional macam
dia punya club room he
either he's kekek like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers punya basketball punya like
ya so macam the husband must be really making serious money ah
macam tak masuk akal lah like
and it's not that there's anything wrong with kerja kerja lah but
you're so macam
supply chain abang a job that is quite a big need in singapore
exactly so macam tak masuk akal lah macam
those macam how they rank the
hundred shares bonds ah you have to like buy by the thousands ah if I'm not mistaken so macam you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
but ya lah it just doesn't makes sense to me that dah dah dah belajar susah-susah then macam
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that mamat the his boyfriend
he was quite against macam he liked to look down on a lot of this macam people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this macam
the halal version of jack's restaurant lah there was one at
it's the steak one I remember the there's a halal one made by this chef then he had a
I believe it is or it's just err something like jack's but it's halal
then the mother is back there then he is here lah then the father remarried then I think like the father macam
dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit lah like the father
like macam it doesn't make sense lah and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from wei xiang wei xiang told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
lemon yogurt you tak you tak ingat eh
you don't macam
macam bodoh lah macam don't don't jangan lah pakai your own freaking like
so so macam I was telling like him ah that
they they don't want to macam speak out against like gay people because like
like people don't want to macam oh actually she's a liar and all these ya
a lot lah I tell you right all these macam people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like dee kosh is quite stupid lah in my mind macam
you're famous kau famous macam like people know people people know your face then
kau buat macam gini macam you want to proposition right don't use your own account lah
pakai macam pakai fake account lah gini pakai your own account macam you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for macam like someone is
because macam
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to macam
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough macam
so same for dee kosh ah macam just because you you
doesn't like make it right lah you should own self macam
first of all right there is no budak zaman sekarang you and me right are difference by five years only
okay first of all right it's not budak-budak zaman sekarang there are people your age right
what rothschild what those other like err rockefeller and those macam
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder punya line the lauder family
all your shakes macam
so ya so macam
I'm a foodie so macam
you know what this reminds me okay no no no ingat tak mummy kan kata macam she said that
the I think wak nia right was just posting so much about her life on the like
WhatsApp group chat so mummy was saying macam sia annoying lah macam um kenapa nak buat macam gini
mm people yang yang nak attention lah yang yang yang gila gila attention so much ah that's what mum was saying macam
people yang like you know macam
huh they gila kan lelaki no macam they crazy for attention lah like they they
I I would be quite interested in like what is macam joe rogan's punya like
that he has fights to macam to announce ah like
what does he do like what is there macam preps that he have to do does he actually have to like research on
uh twenty nine but I tak terjun botol punya orang sebab I I don't know because that time I rasa macam I terjun botol when you actually uh proposed to me right I rasa macam like the happiest girl on earth lor then macam
macam semak because the thing is that um it's not very often for me to get um
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like macam those people who idiots people lah but then uh
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old wah sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi ha ya so
I rasa macam I think this the right time for us to get married
but remember that time we kena kena tipu
the for our kad jemputan
to your mother also lah from actually stopped me also mak mak stopped me
I actually oh the next one the problem was uh the kalau the tak nak nyanyi eh tak nak show up we got the best tau he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
huh ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer lah then that caterer also say um I don't know lah he's like that lah the perangai macam apa lah gitu so I was like macam ah merepek seh perangai
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude macam siak so macam uh eventually I
call I I try to find kat facebook tengok ada tak siapa-siapa so I found
then that kan so all the lagu semua lah ada lagu melayu semua all mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus uh baju semua awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
the whatever kan semua tak show up tak apa tapi caterer kalau tak show up wah
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that makanan apa kan ha orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa maggi mee
ya macam lah
ya I mean um he he dia very professional lah professional dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu and dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun for ah because the reason is that my mum is under religious punya school studies so kalau
so kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti my mum was like eh don't open like all these kind of song ah
ha so macam he understand like throughout truly lah everything semua dia faham semua so the was good
uh eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer datang we got our photoshoot photographs semua
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes kita punya video tak dapat balik so orang lain um tunjukkan video kat facebook after like what
two weeks kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
yes correct then the things that bila I that's when I found out that macam
um actually I don't really care lah that's it's correct lah macam sedih kita tak dapat video tapi at that same time I say
video could be just a story then tapi I nak cerita I dengan you like forever punya cerita video so I say okay
I want to get my own video tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat because my computer very slow
ya I know banyak tapi video um computer slow the things that all nak kena tunggu the computer baru datang baru boleh buat
ya the cuaca was nice because dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun so it was just that perfect moment
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding um because that wedding kan um I like my wedding betul but
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom punya wedding right is like terbaik ah pada I um shout to shah ibrahim he make it like macam it's like a hotel
tapi still macam tak hotel juga parking is the perfect place to park the car because apa ni kat mana eh
kan tanjong katong complex yes so that place was macam tanjong katong complex where dia punya
um what is called ya mm ya dia punya parking is open space it's there's lot of parking kalau tak ada parking pun you can still park at wisma you can still park at
hooga eh salah group punya side banyak tempat untuk you nak park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then dia punya makanan and then when I ask my friend because um I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there semua cakap makan and everything is just cost like less eh
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like macam that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like macam if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice lah cuma one thing about bad about that place it's not bad lah I say macam
not that fantastic about that place is just that dia punya tempat nak tukar baju and everything mm
ah yes because the things that macam okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as apa kita tahu kan mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali
ya around two to three right uh some ours was three ya ours was three eh no the sanding was two and then the nikah was one but nikah was a day before
so macam kita kita macam wah get married and then ah one thing about ya that one is just that ah
and then dapat hotel semua my friend actually uh because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process lah like macam because wedding malay weddings like kelam-kabut nak mampus leh bukan bukan uh macam jauh ah ah macam
bila you dah you nak tukar baju kan lepas tu you nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding
sekali macam you nak kena naik kereta go to the hotel just to tukar baju and then go back there so macam ah traffic and then campur you nak kena make up semua and then nak kena pakai baju semua so eventually that one ah take process up to two to three hours eh
the hours eh maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to alah dah cukup datang
tak lah tak juga pasal kalau nak buat photoshoot tak ada time mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi kan ha semua orang nak ambil gambar that time semua ha selit sikit
sikit ah sikit jer tapi that's the only macam if for orange ballroom ah but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary kita buat wedding lagi
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum punya dia akan suka okay about malay wedding eh
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or terpaksa like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one makcik when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like eh you got child ni you got child some more ah
walao I was like macam eh nak eh kelakar lah makcik ni
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually dia orang cuma ingat yang my mum cuma ada my brother and sister my kakak lah
cause my brother my kakak is the only people who are like macam
terserlah I me and my adik kita orang macam relax ah kita orang relax chill lepak bro tak buat apa-apa semua kita relax tak macam
my sister and my brother ha kita memang low profile relax ah relax like like you juga kan you pun relax tak buat apa-apa juga macam
ya lah tapi that time uh
we did say to uh my sister did say back because my sister was there I wasn't there kalau I was there macam over
so confirm I dah gaduh dengan dia lah tapi dah tak uh tapi K what if K takpe next question uh just asking you what is the luckiest or like macam you rasa macam
um thank god that time one one thing is the cuaca kan cuaca cuaca was like perfect ah okay then another thing apa yang you suka pasal that wedding
the other guy I mean my friend punya
I feel like macam that is the most the best thing ah of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about tak boleh makan or can makan also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know ah maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually ah menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi
mm tak ha dah kahwin pun ha tapi um
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do lah tapi macam
macam kalau tak then I I I I still okay so takpe okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin I dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana I dapat tahu macam mana you punya cara you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my makcik cakap auntie lisa lah she told me that
orang ketiga ke apa alhamdulillah I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no orang ketiga
it's almost six years already um we are not uh blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with uh being with you lah okay so um tapi kan I nak tanya you what was on your mind
okay uh bila you dah kahwin okay once you dah habis
all the nikah right and then um all the sanding semua dah habis kan and then outside then um kat dalam bilik dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur kan
but what was on your mind eh dalam otak you tu apa you fikir macam it was for me like I fikir macam eh aku dah kahwin lah seh
aku dah aku dah I'm like all these responsibilities macam fuh dah jatuh kat kat I lah then I rasa macam eh I dah kahwin eh like like really I dah kahwin eh I tak sangka I dah kahwin and then ah so I was like macam okay takpe lek even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there lepas tu macam oh wait wait wait kau dah kahwin
okay so that was like uh that but it wasn't a big thing yet ah ah but for you what what's on your mind bila
you bila all this dah habis kan and the sanding part semua dah habis what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya then like because the thing is that uh okay regarding about the call right dia macam mana tau
because the thing is that kalau you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home ke tak
ah not because um curang ke apa lah ha but it's more to like macam um like you pukul berapa nak balik I mean like worried tau worried uh you you also did because the thing is that
bila I dah jadi isteri
where are you tu semua and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like macam kalau malam alone not that good lah kan cause it's like macam
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good lah thank god we've got a good neighbourhood ah but no people like any tom dick or harry ke apa ke you call dia orang nak strike strike malam apa betul tak
ha so I tak suka lah kan
then um so another thing is like respect lah also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you ah bila eh you ni bila nak balik ni semua then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya tapi there's the I mean mostly you like about that lah ah but one thing about him like you tak kasih I you kasih I bebas
kebebasan also so I rasa macam happy lah ha so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind lah like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out lah yang kita ni ada banyak kesamaan in terms of like movies
ya and then like macam movie macam
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like macam harry potter you don't like tapi um lord of the ring you like and then
err so macam okay lah give and take ah stuff like that uh then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
jap at that time you belum apa at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
meticulous lah macam semua benda I mesti macam make sure that everything eh mesti macam
goes well lah uh because I punya orang tak macam itu tau I punya orang tak macam eh tak jadi pergi sini ah pasal ah due to this and that and this and that I rasa macam I rasa risau ha but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day eh kita macam eh on that time we actually had fun eh ha better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu macam tak plan apa and lepas tu kita terus like uh okay just dive ah
kita pergi cameron and port dickson
duit ada so I macam okay I terjun jer ah ha so it was macam it was fun lah it was fun kita pergi honeymoon tu semua and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then uh travel then
uh then he he can drive well ha naik atas semua and then because that one also is my first time I went out to um holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone ke pergi dengan kawan ke or pergi
dengan boyfriend apa tak pernah my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets semua kan orang lain dah siapkan dah
tapi kan ah but one thing is just like it's just fun lah tapi it's it's one thing like I feel like macam wah dah dah start into responsibility end up okay dah tahu macam mana nak book hotel tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis stop tak asyik book hotel jer nak pergi holiday jer
actually ada banyak juga for bandung but ada tapi kita tak tak venture ke sana lah
I regret tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin but then again I rasa this is still the right time because the thing is that
ah macam kita tak boleh buat macam uh and then um but then again after I dah berapa tahun yang I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people punya kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I rasa kan the time I I
I macam suka ikut-ikut orang ah macam oh dia ni ada bag dior I pun nak bag ah yang I nak pun nak I I pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat cafe ni semua but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding lah our wedding supposed to be like macam our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that dia orang suka um
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and hey you jangan cakap you pun tak ada flaws gitu eh ha tapi macam like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example kan macam kalau dulu you tahu kalau before kahwin kan uh kalau kalau tak kalau you kahwin you can play endless car ke apa kan freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but um
after marriage maybe you find like macam oh nak kena layan dia ni lah nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets ah
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding oh macam sekarang ha macam for me kan I tak regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but uh macam being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married ah ah but one thing about you you don't you don't let macam ah give me to kongkong you know macam like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that kan ha tapi you kasih I freedom of what to do like for example even this uh recording screen ke apa ke
some people will find it macam the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give ha so macam it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really macam into it lah
ha cakap nanti berselerak lah apa lah
ya kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah lah kan so so eventually macam not all guys can actually accept this ah so actually one thing I I happy lah I dapat kahwin dengan you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it macam funny ah because that time I wasn't planning mah to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking eh this guy okay or not ha
I I tak boleh seh kalau you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
ha if you do have another girl outside or what then um that was one of my biggest fear lah I have I don't have like small small fear but then macam that one I think that if that happen terus cut ah
ah and also pukul lah but then I there wasn't any hit or anything ah I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything lah uh so um okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
uh like for example anything ah that you think like ada ke apa biggest fear lah
some in-laws lah kalau there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me macam I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum ke apa and then your mum don't like me akan cakap eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni sia eh sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni ha dah lah gemuk tak lawa tu semua but then it's like
not like that ah your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually um uh apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua so we were like
featuring guest lah kalau you nak uh
six years and then macam kalau you want to have another what what what is your no request lah what is your future plans for the next four years before we step into that ten year punya anniversary ya
ha to join us apa semua tu so I wish that kita our financial also is doing good and everything and then um healthier family and also um slimmer but until now also dah five years also still not slim so
ya lah takde lah just just saying only
and then because of that dia upset mengamuk
but we always also carry what angkat jer pe
oh ya makcik seth ya so apparently seh couldn't do work properly ya and then and then got send out and then got send away that's why we wanted to came out why barang-barang semua tak betul kan
ah I mean if you really want you can but I think dia masih qualify lah
she's married what ya but she's she's married kan so kalau dia married but the husband is is B
so dia boleh declare berapa banyak dia nak apa you cannot
in which even if no matter what amount she puts because for us it's below five hundred kasi dia susah report to company
no but she going to class A so mama said will be like not so busy so most probably since dia ah
dia layan orang punya karenah ya
mama bear tak datang mama bear tak datang niari
tan sri ada tan sri mm
I think tak ada orang
it will just selalu on macam gitu but I don't think there's anybody
clement leave yes and then darlene tak ada
colin tak ada colin he's on leave also no no no not colin siapa tu no thomas
for the company he volunteered kena kena volunteered lah
no I was through home then okay lah cause my wife kerja malam today
seven thirty so kira since I'm not going to see her tonight you see so just make it one day and then we just spend the whole day together
did my bookings for my staycation pan pac because my friend dia celebrating
no because my friend did err is doing ah his daughter's birthday party kat situ like the same one I did for my son ya so like eh like he's some relative also like staying over lah they actually asked us to I think just they book dua bilik back to back because the the room can actually you know you book it together
the rooms actually always separate there's outside door yang you boleh tutup then you can remove the bilik macam besar so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no lah then ask us to stay over for dua malam mesti dia ada ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in ah I've been there before no no the pools were but dia limited so you need to book when you're there lah so basically ah I want to go to the pool do you have any like
so ada kitchenette ada apa no no I don't know that's my friend
endorse then present it on saturday tu saturday ya cause saturday we got video shoot with suhaimi yusof
err there's a lot of groups lah yeah sheik alauddin group he sea games ya I mean he's like the he was like he's like the same like fandi ahmad he was the first melayu who got the spot ah so called went on international platform
and stuff but when it comes to sheik questionable ah there are but not a lot there's not a lot ajak-ajak ayam but now my
then kadang-kadang like copy paste copy paste apasal ni tak copy paste to me it's oh ya ya you use Macbook that's why I think I did use Mac computer before last time when I was working for this one company
ya something like no dia punya urat hati dia putus
sedih kan
it's only like what time tu
dua belas eh tiga belas
his parents used to stay two ah levels up from my rumah lama in west coast
so in a way I think we we were like we were so called growing up playing together when younger after that we went our own ways then dah tak apparently we meet back in the same school so that's why I know the whole family so the brother passed away one year after
I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy tau orang yang macam they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
even my friends also okay lah last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then macam like jumpa gitu jer lah like you know
I think so it was baju merah maybe dia maybe dia datang bulan lah eh no it's not august

unless he swings the other way very unlikely he's married ya so like so and still very macam courteous sopan santun or maybe because coming here applying so macam baik kan selalu kat rumah ya kesian
the kata orang tu nak jadi jadi jer lah
because there was this one ah there's this one scene so dia cakap
that's why we are quick to change will be like okay lah takpe lah it's okay dah dah takdir

agaknya it's because of tadi tak yang orang tu beli pokka abeh dorang masuk oh no it's us also
so kalau banyak merah maknanya tak boleh maybe because we are enclosed

why is it cheaper in hawaii I think if I'm not wrong in the states only a few state is like no no not hawaii there's some states also pun murah because that time when I was err playing my nintendo street right so there are some things that you need to buy there are some games you need to purchase in online store so
maybe dorang dua tak jadi
which I am quite okay about also tak ada gambar
no kebiasaan
oh kena hantar
ah tak lah aku dengar apa ni
laki negro ni dia cakap
cam first dates semua tak mahu bawa apa ni macam makan semua just bawa jalan-jalan lepak tu macam wow betul lah pasal kalau
macam dia press for more nanti macam nampak lah what kind of person she is but ni semua orang dorang dorangnya alpha punya fikiran lah
aku keluar dengan kau ingat aku keluar dengan mimi kan tak pernah bayar apa-apa
tu ah cakap perempuan kalau gini dia boleh makan for free seven days straight boleh jumpa
but one thing aku agree dengan dia kan
macam baru kau kenal kan
she belongs to the street unless korang official about the status
macam kau tahu orang cakap macam kalau kau pergi date
kau fuck around pe gini macam suka hati dia ah
so like you have no right to like cakap dia slut ke apa kalau boleh meet sesiapa kau nak kasi dia banyak choice siapa dia nak as long there's no official status
dia berbual pasal ni kan
oh betul
ah ada yang kau pernah dengar this guy nama stephen top
tak stephen something ah some black guy dia tak believe in macam relationships yang macam boyfriend girlfriend
no matter what as long kau belum married kan you are considered just dating
I rather you still dating terus aku fikir balik
it somehow makes sense but maybe culture pun plays a part ah
asal ah
kau nampak ah
kau pun tak ada status pe
takde eh
yang laki selalu kau post eh
untuk aku ni semua macam pun ikut surroundings ah
cam not everytime kau kena guard
musim-musim you know you have to time yourself
kalau it's time to emotion let it out lah but if it's not the time then it's okay for you to be this way we understand
but at the time kau kau tak cakap then you still takde as long ah you know
cause of them takut cakap
laki takut nak keluarkan emotion kan but
some of them dorang okay keluar emotion but they don't know when
bila orang tak tahu macam mana nak express dorang punya emotions aku tak boleh pegang ah
ha ha ha asal asal dia cakap gitu
missus cheong sedih ah tak nak tengok
to think of it kan it's as seram at the same time
once dia dah realise ah
tapi untuk aku singapore is just that kita tak jumpa orang yang extreme ah like feminist
kau sendiri macam it's a wreck
dia is the true
epitome yang yang YouTube
video yang kau cakap most of this
just macam rosak ah like
that's why kau cakap they use this macam as their own is their moral compass ah
like tak tahu apa yang salah betul dorang pakai ni then they just follow from there
that time cousin aku kena
dia post about ada accident dekat sengkang kan
he happened to help orang yang apa this anak dengan bapa dia ah accident motor abeh dia cakap pasal err dorang accident motor pasal dorang apa ada a wild dog
terus end up this
perempuan datang like into the conversation and say that eh like cakap like
there's this humans is the problem for entering dorang punya wild life and dorang cakap if this is what if you're talking about like putting them putting them down
terus cousin aku macam flip ah cakap you don't put words inside my mouth
macam don't stir something up that it is not there
what the fuck sia attention rabak sia
I mean like dia nya cousin aku nya intention is just to show that okay this area is quite dangerous imagine kalau kau lalu kan just beware of the dogs ah the macam apa wild animals
ni semua orang just find it a like opening of for them to just preach
tak tahu ah malaysia ah
yang malaysian
yang belikan anak dia semua eh
anak dia yang gemuk tu kan
what if the this whole thing is turn table laki yang buat gitu then laki cakap kak sedar lah diri muka kau tu dah buruk gini gini then you know it's just turn out to be ugly
ya we are untuk aku kan at the end of the day we are just living in two separate rules
dia tak macam sense of emergency ah
cannot focus macam takleh
ah dia kacau ah
dorang just macam
camne nak cakap eh pasal the reason why tiga orang to operate that one man machine kan is cause that two person tak tahu apa
ah macam terus ni apesal
rabak sia tu
like kepala ah orang
umur berapa sia
kalau aku aku tak kesah sia like I think taufik pernah cakap ah the macam untuk aku the apa not it's too accessible apa knowledge eh
dorang pakai sembarang jer
oh macam dia annoyed
kau kau pause eh
tak kan
takpe ah aku bawa gi toilet jer boleh berbual-bual sikit
ah tak ah sangkut kat luar
a'ah cuci tangan
semalam shuk shuk bawa apa ah makan
wah best pe macam yang taiwan taiwan nya eh
wah aku dah macam
huh bastard asal
oh tak halal
huh kau makan
oh kau taruk tepi untuk simpan
sial ah kau
asal ah
dia apa fight as if like politically or
untuk aku is a marketing strategy ah
kalau dia macam berbual macam admit dia president siapa nak vote dia seh
macam dia have to say
tapi kau tahu yang dia popular face habis cakap grab them by the pussy kan
ah itu bukan dia cakap during press ke atau during ni kan it's during macam dia punya free time want to record dengar kan
pasal tak salah aku aku tengok video clip is like somewhere macam kau tahu yang camera macam sembunyi-sembunyi abeh dia ada wall abeh ada
macam mesti lah orang orang kat luar laki lain pun cakap macam gitu apa it's just that ni pasal dia korang macam nak use that against pasal ramai orang kalau kau tengok they use that phrase against dia apa this is how he treats women gini macam sial ah
pasal orangnya perception eh perspective sekarang is like
camne eh they rather have someone yang in the closet
macam sial rather than orang outspoken
dorang takleh accept orang outspoken macam orang he only talking his own opinion in what appears on his mind what tapi orang tak boleh accept
pasal kalau untuk aku orang tu clean kan terlalu baik aku aku always despise
macam there's there's always a way macam macam mana kita berbual pun kan ]even though
you want the best for each other kan but definitely kita macam gini boys talk atau mesti ada berbual kotor pe like gini gini but
orang yang macam terlalu clean kan aku always very despise macam
bukan aku jealous tau like how are you really sure kau macam gini punya bersih like
cam they feel their feelings express it that's all
lagi twenty seven minutes
all the lie tak ah
asal eh
tak tahu apa dia nak ah
so at the end of the day pun different orang tengok lain pe
so macam upon macam texts pun sama
macam kalau aku cakap sial lah kau
tapi kalau kau baca eh dia ni maki aku pe sial
tapi kalau aku aku cakap in a very playful way
kalau kau tengok macam kau punya thoughts macam gitu then kau fikir cara gitu then
how can can you blame me sia aku say in a very cannot blame me ah
non-stop sia tu
ah dorang ada record macam some dorangnya
talk ah sedih sia
pasal kau boleh dengar dari suara dia sia kau yang ah
aku tak tumbuk kau sia I mean like kau tumbuk aku
kau tak cakap abeh amber macam aku pukul kau jer pe
pots and pans kau campak vase
like tak salah ke tu salah seh kau tahu
macam aku ada listen to few tips orang kahwin ah orang dah kahwin cakap
then that's why it makes sense bila dia cakap
kan selalu cakap stephen kan
buat apa kau nak relationship lama-lama
in the end asal kau nak a meet up marriage before you get married you know you are creating another problem for yourself
kadang-kadang fikir balik macam sedih sia kalau yet to find out
macam apa ni the person that kau sukakan and then bila korang kahwin is just a different person
abeh korang stuck tau you are stuck there don't know like kalau aku tinggal
ni thing aku salah bila aku let it be it's gonna be a problem for me so how do I even solve this sia
like I really dia just stuck sia
that's why aku always believe this phrase macam doesn't mean we can vibe we are compatible
like tak semestinya kita boleh vibe macam eh but we are compatible for each other it doesn't mean that vibe and compatibility is two different thing
like aku boleh kita like boleh macam
ah people always said like wah if I can vibe with you okay okay but sial lah that is just a touch atau it's a two different things seh
whether you're not kau boleh tinggal serumah dengan dia and like accept who she is that's a different thing sia
so untuk aku macam orang selalu macam cakap aku boleh vibe dengan kau it's a
it's not macam it's not cause you can't true
dia nya expectations or
that's why aku takut aku tak understand about aku nya self especially
like sometimes aku suka orang ni then aku akan go for her
but kan bila dah at the stage macam boleh aku just cabut diri
untuk aku is like tak one thing is commitment ah macam the commitment of having someone to jaga is untuk aku really takut untuk aku
ya aku nya reason why aku aku understand this part of me eh aku cakap reason why aku takde mata air bukan aku cakap aku takleh dapat aku boleh but it's just that
dah a few times aku try and then aku just cabut
like aku just fuck up like I always find the reason to fuck this up ah like
just ghost her atau
ya so like sometimes aku just macam bingit ah macam takde then you know like I want something but bila dah ada nanti aku just cabut
so I always remind myself macam
kalau aku suka orang aku cakap kalau dia betul-betul then go for it ah if not then for what you waste your time
like in the end of the day kau akan cabut juga pe at the end of the day kalau kau tak suka dia
that's why that time kawan kau tanya aku aku terus teringat sia ni
kawan kau yang yang kerja nurse eh part-time
tak ah dia tanya takde mata air macam tak ah macam asal entah eh terus aku terus cam teringat ah ni like
aku kalau ada ada ah tapi it's just that at the end of the day aku cabut
aku ya
ya pasal
untuk aku pun itu is a different way of err camne nak cakap eh
it's a different way of macam kita own body ada own mechanics ah
the reason why macam aku dengan kau is always macam
diam dulu then nanti baru gerek is cause technically we are trying to protect ourselves
like dia ni boleh ngam ke tak tak leh ngam then why not why for what aku waste akunya time
kalau dia punya dia punya mindset is macam I got nothing to lose the world is mine
then like just live life to the fullest lah that kind of mindset ah but for us yes we have that mindset but it's just that macam
macam apa ni you don't need it unless we really need it come ya
romanticism atau all the stuff
ya lah I understand
one thing dorang been berbual pasal gender role ni semua kan dorang sendiri confused with their own gender role this kind of thing untuk aku lelaki shouldn't be the one doing it the most of the time it's it's a feminist trait lah I would say
so macam all these macam sweet stuff
all the macam masculine stuff the girl of course have to be kalau dua-dua side macam family then how how do we even counter this
there's no balance ah then after that's when nanti dorang dah complain oh dia ni annoying ah gini gini gini
like you eat too much sweets sakit tekak pe
kalau kau suka laki tu apa-apa dia buat pun sweet pe
dia tak buat apa-apa pun sweet abeh kalau laki tu macam he's not your type
asal pula aku kena panggil creep
ya lah
that's untuk aku there's no such thing ah
cause the scariest part kan macam macam mana kau dah kahwin dengan this someone kan
how sure are you that this twenty four hour otak dia is bedek bedek
bila kita tengah main kan aku boleh imagine someone else asal kau tak boleh imagine someone else confirm kau boleh imagine someone else pe but at the end of the day you have to give and take let her be and let her think let us think
that that's why the misconcept of macam
like oh takde connect then they cakap to make it in a very layman dengan very
to see that they are smart atau they can feel all these oh takde connection ah
ah lagi
thirty seconds nak tidur nak tidur
oh okay okay okay aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni mystery shopper that was many years back lah then after that uh the I only did once
because uh lepas tu like there's no job and nobody call me lah I did the ah aku pernah buat yang apa yang shopping tu eh
I did the one for uh one of the retailers in singapore lah but I have to go it's a it's a one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet tau lepas tu kan
one of the important one is the customer service ah because they are rating customer service punya survey
so you actually depends ah macam when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things err they are looking out for
and then err ya but for me is I just concentrate one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet lah
tapi uh after that they never call me oh for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar tapi dia punya product is
then uh she's given one product so it actually varies macam kau buat uh mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like err basic necessity macam for your home
but uh my friend one is quite interesting dia pergi dia buat pasal uh food product ah I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think macam like uh macam maggi then with a a particular brand specific brand
lepas tu nanti uh dia kena pergi uh two or three no three or four different err supermarket
so it depends ah macam mana kau punya what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
tak lah sia upfront
so it's your own free time bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
ya it's quite fast cuma uh they will give you a deadline lah by this date kau kena submit back come back to the office and submit ah
lama seh but I think that time was not hundred ah less than that
mm assignment tapi the assignment uh dia kasih macam uh tiga
the one the ya then the questions is all similar lah cuma three different outlet kau kena pergi then macam outlet A outlet B outlet C lepas tu the questions are the same ah
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that macam berselerak ke ataupun very neat always very neat
uh eh this date this or this week right got this date this time uh apa ni surveyor coming
so it's like uh consistency lah cuma the
tapi like the working hours how
cuma it's like quite far lah I mean uh I think I feel like it's quite far tapi three times a week okay what ah
ya lah but I heard that the pay is quite good you know uh apa ni I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like macam dormitories eh the they can even pay up to macam I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend uh and my friend was saying lah macam gini like uh she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
tapi uh do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
ya lah rumah dia berapa bilik seh
mm it's so far it's still okay lah we don't have any pay cut tapi macam
macam uh like how long can we tahan like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical lah
so like uh and then plus being in the fintech kan macam don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
then uh like other products macam very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
ya lah I mean rumours have been going around lah it's better to look for something else but again in this situation macam mana nak cari seh
abeh kalau macam right now like right now I'm still okay lah I still have a job what but then
so I was like eh when I look at linkedin I was like eh ada eh orang masih nak masih nak cari ni ah
dia jaga macam uh one of the creative uh asia pacific punya director eh APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas pergi overseas punya office kan
lepas tu uh her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
basically aku tengok macam
I was like oh my gosh macam some people are just so lucky
lepas tu macam new joiner new secretary join kan lepas tu dia tak nak uh macam she she will be the mentor lah because she senior what
and then uh selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak jer lah like like just ask people to do ah ask people to do the powerpoint
uh ask people to change the apa send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay sekali it in the end bila dia punya boss tu dah tua ah
sekali just before I left uh boss dia kena macam apa macam apa tu
bukan retrench apa tu macam uh dah dah tua kan jadi uh kena
so uh they we speculated ah dia dia kata golden handshake so the boss leave right
kan aku dah macam eh kayanya dia ni lepas tu dia tak ada anak
for her europe trip lah this trip lah that trip lah I was like lepas tu the worst part is kerja lepak gila
but who the she was the one who supposed to do the powerpoint you know in the end she ask the other people yang macam very uh pandai buat powerpoint kan
ah then buat lepas tu dia dia just submit to the boss that's all her job like that I also can do and I can still earn eight nine K you know
gila kan
no lah but she was she was okay lah it's just that she's an okay friend but then it's just that working wise macam suka ask people to do buat ni buat tu eh
then she will be like uh sorry I have a a lunch appointment sorry I have this appointment that appointment lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap okay dia tolong kan
sekali apparently that day she's on leave and she never tell you know macam bastard kan then then I will be like oh my god gosh like
eh when you ask me to ask you to to help you I help you seh then I was like okay lah then just telan jer lah because we are all junior level what she's the senior one what
macam merepek kan like so funny
and then she never tell him ke
yes yang dulu tu uh every time want to travel on only
kecoh seh but actually because I want to collect the points ah
so funny but they are allowed to travel on lah but then macam ah cannot the expensive uh like whatever flight eh kau tahu dari like expensive flights and all that right
ya lah macam yang boleh cancel boleh change semua kan
ya lah tu pasal kadang-kadang ah like what like especially the boss that likes to change every time will change lah or confirm will change his flight one right
aku nak book macam ah so scary then I will always wait until like really last minute eh kadang-kadang macam cannot so last minute what
ah macam ah the first name and last name terbalik apa and then got one or like I think two alphabet lah typo error
salah salah salah the name uh of the passenger becomes my name
the traveller's name to my name because I cannot use that uh apa macam
lagi pergi hong kong siak tu kalau pergi indonesia ke pergi mana mana like okay lah got potential to keep uh at most I pay back the company what
sekali tu that one is like like uh to hong kong and then is like completely different name ah so I called them up and asked to change right
and then uh apa ni they say cannot then I said
is I explained the whole situation lah I said I when I fill up I already fill up the correct name the correct passport the date of birth passport number semua
then cuma the last part the contact person the contact person when I fill up my uh I fill up my name
then uh there's one part that they they auto macam auto fill eh
sekali I go and pay everything then I realise and then after ah but they don't they didn't they didn't bother to listen to my explanation lah
tak baik seh
aku bilang aku punya tu lah yang senior tu makcik tu makcik makcik kaypoh tu
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku uh it's okay lah everybody make mistake don't worry tapi dia baik cuma macam dia kaypoh eh
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku just tell the uh pula tu aku kena bilang
dia cakap just tell the he's a very nice person uh I will back you up anyway you just started
cakap okay lah selamat ah first time kan so aku cakap abeh tapi aku offer lah if you want I can pay half of the flight ticket ah muka sedih ah
tapi tu baik gila sia dia cakap uh nevermind it's okay uh just make sure next time you don't repeat the same mistake ni semua ah blah blah blah that one I was less than three months old in the company you know like I see how much was the ticket
ya lah tapi macam irritating tak boleh kasih chance seh
irritating lepas tu kan lagi sekali uh is what ah
then after dah kecoh gila sekali got one guy and one guy right he's supposed to travel he is from vietnam to singapore he supposed to travel uh with
lepas tu the three of them reached the airport
sekali two of them went in<malay>dah masuk sekali tu yang the this the the last guy right was they she want to check in ah then the dengan bag dia semua tau
kesian dia dah lah check out daripada hotel lepas tu dia pergi kat airport abeh airport cakap ah sir your flight is tomorrow not tonight

I was like oh shit I was like mula-mula aku ketawa tau aku cakap huh aku macam ketawa ah
sekali dia kata no it's not funny when you are at the airport and two of your colleagues are going to board the plane and you are stuck here with no hotel room to go to
aku dah macam eh sia ah die die sia mana aku nak carikan dia ni hotel and he is very specific luckily bukan boss ah dia macam manager level there
aku dah selamat sia kalau boss aku mampus
then I was like ah oh okay terus aku macam okay okay let me check for you like the next available flight ah dia kata err
I don't want to fly macam certain timing apa dia sekarang aku nak kena book under the new flight apa dia mati-mati nak leave uh that night ataupun the next day morning eh
because he got meeting or whatsoever lah so he need to leave like there as soon as possible kecoh sia
ya then I was like ah okay okay let's divide and conquer you find hotel I go and find flight then he was like okay okay okay aku
tu lah masalahnya because they always keep on changing tau and then aku rasa uh yang yang lain tu aku dah book siang-siang tapi si lelaki ni
dia kasih dia bilang aku last minute dia nak flight ni nak flight tu the these are the flights he want this is ni ah
kira dia bilang aku last minute aku book kan dia separately last minute ah aku bukan book kan dia orang tiga-tiga at the same time
lepas tu aku tengok eh aku dah kecoh sia cari hotel
lepas tu aku cari flight ah lepas tu lepas tu dia call aku dia cakap did you manage to get the flight aku cakap uh not yet
abeh aku kasih dia options kan lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku ya I also can't get a hotel
uh it's too last minute and no hotels around here ah ya it's all fully book aku dah macam alamak
in the end we got lah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia like uh aku tak boleh dapat flight yang kau betul-betul nak at this exact timing yang kau nak depart this is the only best option eh
habis tu dia cakap uh apa apa apa lepas tu dia kata ah okay then uh he he we sorted out the flights ah
hotel pula then uh last minute he say he just went back to the hotel that he just check out kesian kau I feel so bad I was like
apa dia dia kata uh I just took I'm going to take a taxi now to go back to the hotel and see they have one last room
abeh aku cakap ah okay okay okay uh you take the cab and then I know lah the journey about thirty minutes eh
lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia you go and take the cab now I will call the hotel
lepas tu pergi ah
lepas tu dah dah finish after the whole episode right dia dah balik hotel dia dah dapat tau the last room and I think it's the smallest room he's and he's very particular about hotel room also
so dia cari dah lah last minute tak ada hotel tapi nak cari hotel yang according to his category
aku dah macam ambil jer lah hotel apa yang ada it's just for one more night the next day afternoon that time he's flying off already what
lepas tu dia cakap uh yang dia patah balik hotel tu sekali kita berbual-berbual uh abeh aku cakap dengan hotel tu ah boleh ah macam any room can ah because
it's just for one night ah lagipun dia selalu regular kat hotel kau
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay and then in the end they found one small studio room for him ah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
dia kata no it's okay lepas tu uh sabo sia lepas tu dia dapat dia tak dapat flight yang pagi kan pasal the next day petang dia ada meeting tau
lepas tu pagi dia tak dapat flight yang dia nak kena balik kan aku dapatkan dia petang ke malam I think
lepas tu uh bila dia dia bilang dengan boss aku kira he's under my boss what dia bilang dengan boss aku uh
lepas tu aku cakap eh sabo sia dia ni tapi boss aku tak marah boss aku ketawa jer dia cakap are you just trying to skive and not come for the meeting
dia cakap no she book me the wrong flight aku dah macam oh crazy
kan lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia lah eh then you also should check you know aku tapi aku macam okay lah let's not be let's not fight over this aku cakap dengan dia we are both at fault I booked wrongly and you didn't check
mampus kan actually initially he was like that tapi aku cakap dengan dia there's really no other flights
uh budget flight pun tak ada unless you want to reel up and go via mana entah aku cakap dengan dia macam a very long route eh in the end you reach singapore also like the same
and lepas tu macam but after that he was like okay lah tapi he took that opportunity to shoot me back ah in front of my boss dia cakap ah ya she book me on the wrong date
flight back aku dah macam tapi yang ni pun sepatutnya aku kena declare dengan finance the ya the right
aku cakap eh uh eh this is what happen dia kata in case if uh anybody question then you can just look for me ah but if nobody question just let it go
buy new ticket ah lepas tu pun dah cock-up lagi then the the makcik kaypoh the senior told me like it's okay you just have to declare again aku cakap
declare lagi hari tu dah declare cakap sorry then declare lagi mampus
tu ah
lepas tu aku cakap ah takpe lepas tu but then the finance I think the finance explained to the lah
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay lah dah
uh aku rasa something more expensive tu pasal in the end he earn what right because he get to fly on the more expensive flight and don't have to go for meeting
uh entah
one way ticket totally different airline kiranya vietnam tu forfeit ah pasal dia tak nak travel on that timing yang kat vietnam yang aku dah book tu the next day punya kan
aku cakap pergi jer lah balik jer lah besoknya dah terang-terang dah ada vietnam flight tu
vietnam apa ho chi minh
tak tapi hari tu semua dah fully booked tak ada tak ada flight
budget airline yang kita check lepas tu ada like go uh transit via whatever very far away right
irritating kan with the transit punya tu
ya lah that's why I was like like lepas tu dia pula macam he's very particular hotel leh
then flight okay dia macam apa-apa macam economy apa-apa lah dia cuma but tapi hotel must be really
tu aku cakap mampus sia that day terus sekarang aku cakap uh we let's we both learned a lesson every time I send you you check okay
dia kata but uh it's not funny aku kata it's not funny when your
kan kelakar kan tapi lepas tu bila dia balik singapore I think the next he say hey let me uh hidayah let me buy you coffee we should go for a good coffee
dia cakap ya let's just go to the one across the road no need to get so expensive
lepas tu dia macam aku cakap dengan dia so next time moving forward aku book kau please check because aku cakap dengan dia at that point of time kau tahu tak date yang aku book tu bila
aku book on friday I think five plus in the evening eh nak dekat pukul enam tau
last minute everybody like confirm confirm confirm nak ni nak tu lepas tu kita aku duduk kat office tu dengan kawan aku kat depan ni
we went through like so many booking and then takut macam duplicate booking kan macam aku dah book the book kan
lepas tu some of the people right in the kira total about eleven twelve people all travelling at one time
but all like different departure date ah different timing different flight terus aku split dengan kawan aku ni aku cakap okay kau buat dia ni punya flight aku buat dia punya flight okay
lepas tu macam overlap lepas tu uh bilik pula kau buat ah okay kau buat this hotel room aku buat ni ni ni punya okay
lepas tu macam it's so messy I was like oh my gosh
takkan aku nak buat on weekend seh so I have to do it over what I was like
tak boleh pasal uh why ah
pasal itu hari pasal apa eh that we we divide like that because I think some is his people some is my people lepas tu
lepas tu uh those who is travelling on saturday there is some from my list that is also travelling on saturday so aku pass kat dia
lepas tu dia anyway ya lah
lepas tu ah it's it's like that lah so it becomes like I don't just take care of my team you know macam my team got ten people right she got two for example right
then I got like maybe three people that's also travelling on the same date as her one of the people that she's in her team so macam kita passing passing eh
lepas tu hotel pula lagi satu kan kita kena book direct we don't have travel agent what
ah aku punya team luckily that guy is like like like like very good I mean he's okay with me lah
he's irritatingly macam uh macam action he's from india
tapi actually he's he's a very straightforward person and he he mean no harm lah it's just business nothing personal eh
lepas tu yang si hotel lagi satu hal
kita book direct kita takde ni kan travel agent kita book direct kan lepas tu kita pergi lah booking dot com hotels dot com apa apa yang murah-murah tu kan
lepas tu hotel the the same hotel dah full
abeh uh apa ni aku cakap dengan kawan aku tu eh then how dia ni dah full
lepas tu aku cakap okay aku try go hotels dot com sekali bila kawan aku pergi booking dot com tau aku pergi hotels dot com and we are finding the same hotel
and hotels dot com ada booking dot com tak ada sia then after that

tak pasal this time round dia tak boleh tipu pasal dia ada is the convention or something eh
so he have the he's going for that that's why and we have all the letters from the convention punya tempat ah

terus aku macam aku dah beli empat ratus lebih baru kau nak cakap kau diam-diam dah lah ambil jer visa ni
mampus eh
tapi dia ni very soft spoken very soft spoken macam very lemah lembut gitu
lepas like and then another day is like uh kita tu hari buat video farewell kan
lepas tu kita go around macam uh like everybody just have to wave to the camera ah
lepas tu kawan aku tengah pegang camera tengah jalan around the office kan sekali yang si boss yang aquarius ni
kau tahu dia bukan wave tau dia tunjuk middle finger lah sia
terus kita semua macam terperanjat because he really look like a nerdy good boy macam
you ask him to do anything dia akan buat punya ah macam very like listen like very obedient small boy like that ah
sekali kawan aku tengah jalan take the camera shot in the office kan sekali pergi kat tempat dia he's supposed to wave
suddenly he uh he pull out the middle finger then we were like oh my god did what happen to the good boy like kena sampuk apa sia dia ni
tu dia cakap dia kata cut cut cut retake retake
cakap tahu takut eh we are going to show it to the all the officers what it's a farewell video seh
tu lah aku cakap dia ni agaknya busy gila eh sampai macam dia dah jadi dah lost it ah you know
lepas tu tu hari kita tunjuk the video abeh aku cakap dengan dia uh are you scared or not are we going to show the which one are we going to show
abeh dia cakap ah I know I don't I don't I don't mind you can show whichever one action pula
aku cakap muka dia macam decent kalau dia berbual lagi macam tak pernah pekik tau his voice is always so soft spoken eh
macam very the nice nice boy like that ah
sekali when he show the middle finger I was like oh my gosh all men are the same
ah dia kira aku punya boss ah dia dia
uh marketing side chief marketing officer kelakar
but I was like muka baik macam budak-budak baik sekali padahal sama juga
tak lah singapore ah
sama lah I also
because bila food
but nugget pun chicken what
if it's one lauk for the rest of my life
apa sambal goreng pengantin with ketupat or with nasi
or sambal goreng pengantin with bergedil and nasi
and sis tak akan get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent makanan yang I crave for is
sambal goreng pengantin lah
like ya because to me like sambal goreng pengantin is
sebab you will have everything there
you got paru
ada veggie ah ada sambal kacang panjang
ada chicken
hati ayam pedal eh hati ayam ke pedal eh
limpa eh
bukan eh hati ayam kan
ah so sambal goreng pengantin is like everything that I like to eat is what macam satu dish you makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap seh
but it's considered one what tak eh
oo tak consider eh
why why macam why like that
what tapi itu lah okay lah tak apa lah sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi sis
pulut begitu jer
pulut tak ada rasa sis
pulut lah but you cannot put other lauk
ah tahu lah pulut
because pulut is one dish
the pulut is not a makanan it's not considered lah
because food is life tengok lah badan kita sis
bodoh bodoh
habis sis nak makan apa make up your mind
oo if kita boleh
choose like macam
a dish tak
ada sugar cane
but dia tak ada dia tak ada limited hours you boleh duduk dekat dalam kan
macam if you go yang kita pergi dekat yishun tu yang tu kan if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but yang dia dinner dia up to four hours around three and a half hours lah macam tu
maybe because dia macam on the wheel sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like kenapa Seoul Garden tak boleh extend dia punya duduk dekat dalam
itu lah but if like pun ramai orang masuk apa
mana Seoul Garden Seoul Garden kita duduk sebelum dua jam seh
or exactly two hours then kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu full
so maybe next time we can try lah duduk dekat dalam
for like two hours plus and tengok kena halau ke tak
we should we should apa what's the word ah bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
yang is because dia tak ada they should buat air dalam jug taruk dekat situ
macam Seoul Garden so it's easy pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang the person hantar air
lambat seh
ah lepas tu nanti orang tu get irritated
macam that time pasal naan tu
the person yang get irritated
mm lepas tu dia
macam food lah unlimited food
okay let's say let's say tak ada COVID
so if sis only have to keluarkan duit makan sis have no problem with that
so yang lain so kita bayar makan jer lah like okay lah let's say makan pun alah depends ah
feeling orang kaya because it's fully paid for
sis macam nak makan korean food jom kita fly pergi korea
habis oyster kat mana yang sedap eh was it
the only the the two places that I managed to pergi was
dengan Seoul Garden
and Seoul Garden is totally macam
mm ha macam gitu
woo sis main air satu hari
kalau both of us ah dekat situ ah
kan macam gitu lah
but bora bora is more cantik
but they say yang if they want yang siapa eh they share dia punya travel experiences to see the ah si aifiqah ke mana siapa entah dia kena tidur dekat luar seh then macam imagine it's freezing
oh ya sis terlupa pasal itu ya
oh sis pun nak pergi turkey especially yang dekat hot air balloon punya tempat tu apa cappadocia wah
err dia orang boleh naik all the time you know it's not available all the time it's like terlalu windy cannot then kalau hujan cannot
macam siapa eh that time pergi dia pergi then tak straight away dapat then they have to wait like a few days after that
but they say dekat turkey it's haunted
ya turkey punya sihir eh turkey punya black magic is very very scary
bulan puasa jin is outside only syaitan is locked
so it's like that sis the logic because adik sis pun bulan puasa kena sampuk ya
ya turkish turkish people is very scary dia orang kalau buat buat sampai mati dia orang tak fikir tau dosa dosa pahala dia orang go straight punya dia orang berani mati punya orang tau
ya and dia orang punya macam and
dia orang macam I think dia punya polis eh when it comes to orang mati pasal sihir I think it's a norm thing like I think unusual death is macam benda biasa untuk dia orang
if you watch dabbe sis watch sampai terngiang-ngiang okay
like they can even like sanggup buat mak dia sendiri
yang the latest one eh ke apa
a'ah habis perempuan tu she's aware that
husband ada affair
lepas tu dia buat macam semua kena tau if you watch eh dia macam pretend that dia tak tahu apa-apa pasal dia yang buat
I don't know it's no dia buat mak dia
mmhmm ada nanti macam dia ada macam revenge macam
apa macam tadi you say about mak apa issue ah
like family issues I don't know lah lepas tu buat sampai adik dia gila and something like that lah
the anak buat lah anak dia buat mak dia dengan adik dia
kakak dia yang jahat lepas tu kakak dia nak revenge cuba you watch again
no kakak dia pergi pergi dekat ilmu sihir tu then when the person want to help her the orang yang ilmu sihir tu orang orang yang ilmu sihir tu terus mati he met the ilmu sihir tu tau
yang tukang ubat tu yang si bomoh tu tau
don't want sis tak nak being haunted again it took me a lot of time to still forget about it you know
a'ah a'ah lepas tu kan dia buat macam husband dia ke perempuan tu bunuh kan
the girl the girl yang doctor tu jahat the girl is a doctor what
so bila sis tengok cerita tu sis macam wow like so many things then bila orang tu figure out everything kan
turn turns out macam orang tu pun mati
ke orang tu
ya the tukang ubat tu pergi jumpa yang sihir konon very popular tau
the after dia ada jumpa
like macam perempuan tu jahat
dia cakap kan perempuan tu cakap aku tak suka perempuan ni aku tak suka perempuan ni
so the girl can see tapi lelaki tu macam kau merepek ah macam itu
err macam to to the guy macam he is in between believing macam dia dia as
dia percaya in the unseen as part of faith
cannot mix with science what so he's trying to do both tau to be like nak try to make a logic of that
but ya lah pasal logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but benda unseen ni
we cannot macam
and it's not of our faith to like rukun iman we have to believe in the unseen sebab tu
I don't know lah sis ingat nak pergi
yang macam sis dengar tadi yang cakap dekat situ is cheap yang ada buffet tu halalan toyyiban
ya ke I thought like no lah they showed example if it's eighty dollars eh let's say the amount is seventy five dollars you still it's better you pay seventy dollar then five dollar you pay cash ah dia begitu but that dia tak cakap kena breakdown in how many parts what dia cuma cakap cannot stack
cannot stack that is not macam tak boleh is not refundable
dia cuma cakap begitu jer apa so I think I can pay one ticket ah
it that time dia punya normal ticket is sixty plus sixty eight then express you tambah ten dollars jer seh
ten ke fifteen dollar so it's around eighty plus lah
but cat cat tak boleh bawa masuk dalam
ah dia ada nya turkey
but that time sis makan tempat dia punya yang dekat shrek punya tempat eh
ya sis nak try then dekat mana eh is makanan india
because sis pergi dua kali the first one is
like makan and everything sponsored
bedek seh
sis tak dapat pergi pun
one is at night time because masa tu is like a charity event
so sis dapat masuk malam it's from seven to eleven only
but tak ramai orang ah and the queue is not a lot so sis tak payah beratur panjang but imagine
but imagine pergi jurassic park punya tempat malam-malam sis for a minute there sis panic
yang dia punya ride yang air tu
habis kan dia naik kan
sis dah panic sis nya claustrophobic coming
yang dia duduk yang macam yang dekat roundabout circle kan begitu nanti dia warning then naik
dia macam begitu dah ternaik kan naik tinggi lepas tu dah dekat atas terus shoot begitu
ya I had fun too basah
that time yang yang kita nak try mummy sekali mak dia sampai pujuk the mother pujuk me untuk naik tapi mak tak takut kalau mak penakut ni mak rasa tak takut means it's not scary at all
mmhmm mak dia don't like to take ah roller coaster mak dia scared of roller coaster
a'ah mummy is always long queue then I asked the guy you know yang dekat situ is mummy ride scary
no lah to me if you ask me roller coaster tu lagi scary
then macam dekat sini cuma gelap sahaja lah begitu
but no but the tepi got the drying station what
eh halloween horror nights let's say if you pergi for the halloween horror night right so that means all the rides is still ada lah
then hantu-hantu tu
sis jerit tak
terkejut a'ah lah
sama lah without the express ticket lah
but I think halloween horror nights more people daripada biasa because people nak pergi haunted houses dia
sis nak pergi yang that time punya halloween horror nights yang ada kak pon tu
sebab dia orang cakap bila dia orang buat and the the no no he just gave birth
he wanted to ajak me then sis was thinking then sis macam should I go sebab I heard cerita that masa dia orang make the kak pon punya tempat they malam tengah malam bila nak dia orang nak tutup I think dia kena kacau what
kak pon hmm
oh dekat situ then
maybe she don't want to tell people because nanti orang tak nak datang
ya nothing will scare the shit out of me unless benda tu
a'ah and benda melayu because sis macam melayu
serious dia orang sabah also believe in benda-benda voodoo
oh orang asli is scary also you know
oh that time kan ada yang macam ah there's this exhibition right that macam museum kan exhibition dia buat yang macam you asked me nak pergi ke tak like benda-benda black magic
I don't know lah dia ada macam keris the keris tinggi lepas tu ah dia tangkap the toyol the toyol in the jar and everything ada kak pon paku kak pon
it was it was two years ago lah but where is I think it's at pasir ris the the apa
ya ya I remember it's there because ah I remember hafiz telling me that you want to go like it seems fun lah then I said like macam but it's scary sebab si
jian cheng pergi so I'm not wrong lah

ha engkau tak kelakar eh brother
it's not funny sia you not funny lu lu cari pasal sama wa brother
in islam we believe right kalau kita mati our roh does not exist co-exist in this alam already so that means we are in another dimension tau so our dimension only macam co-exist time we sleep betul tak so like for example if kita mati kita nampak orang-orang people then if
is it the roh of the people or is it ghost or like jin in a form of people
jin or syaitan lah but is it
a really roh atau jin in a form of
ah manusia
apa sia
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn rumah tu semua is actually not because of to have rumah for them and others right
it's actually to show that ah bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita or something like that
what if like life is like that ah then the miskin like got tak ada chance seh
you just imagine eh kalau kita macam the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe orang dekat sana
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you macam too depressed and you tak boleh happy tu cakap you it's like a lot story in the news that people bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision atau
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin apa
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin lah so that's why I say macam
so even if kita kita tak ada duit pun it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do lah kita bunuh diri kita sendiri
kau bunuh people
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money what you you ah yo hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar gets into the head dia stress sangat then macam
socked in the head then terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa is it happens
but we don't know what like macam some people depression macam too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve dia punya debts then they kill
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim eh let's say lah even if you have a chance syurga then if you still have to stay in neraka like you never know how long you have to stay in neraka
and one other story is like macam like sometimes it it gets to me yang macam ah
they say the first thing that will be questioned in alam kubur or in the hereafter is solat like if
if kau the first question like solat kau tak pass yang benda lain semua tak matter already
then it gets to me lah then macam then some people say like some mazhab say ya you no need to pay balik yang
the solat that you missed ah solat just solat taubat then you just try not to do it again
but some people some mazhab say you have to pay back after every solat like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until kita mampus then I asked I asked some people lah let's say kan macam how are we going to know how many solat that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay lah let's say kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis that at times kita solat juga
repay oh maybe if tak
I I wanted to I wanted to ask lah if let's say kita because we are busy in this world kan kita kejar kejar kejar kejar sometimes we don't have time to qada kan so let's say in a sense that kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh
like let's say like aku because of the missed prayer kan
then sis taubat so maybe macam sis susah nak tidur malam then the only time that I can wake up is pukul tiga pagi onwards ah
so maybe that's the time that like macam can be it macam not ganti lah like can it help or not
kan sis macam takut tau let's say macam I want to be prepared macam sis want best of both world I want macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat so let's say macam kita dekat dunia macam ini jer macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam we are already bad dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini
ya just like the story yang yang the orang yang bunuh yang the ninety nine killer or something like that or yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu then dia repent
dia repent dia mati dia masuk syurga because the person say no he didn't belum he haven't tau taubat because allah take his niat as orang tu cakap oh engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang first the first pergi dekat first ustaz ni he went there lepas tu ustaz tu say oh kau tak akan diampunkan lah kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua something like that lah so he out of geram he killed the ustaz
dia kill the ustaz you know
ah then he went to this another ustaz then the ustaz was saying oh ah kalau kau nak berubah if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place macam tempat yang lebih baik lah so he ah kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama something like that
no this is another ustaz so he dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place dia meninggal mati so bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga
ya because niat dia because dia belum taubat lagi tau he tak tahu apa-apa because he just on his way to nak taubat to get out of the place then he already get to syurga so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the niat that matters lah
tapi dah maki lah tu
ya lah tapi maki jer lah
so if you want to maki just maki jer lah kan
moral of the story is all based on out niat what so if like allah decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins dengan kita punya doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of jannah
tapi tak minus
dah ada stated there
I hope for that ustaz also yesterday that macam he's saying lah macam we should educate our child
that be modest penting is part of islam and all but kita pun kena ajar anak kita that you know doesn't mean that dia tak pakai tudung she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child macam what islam is all about since young and it starts from asar dia cakap
ya lah macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap oh dia tak modest dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik it's not a good thing ah to me personally lah because pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan is all masing-masing
I think just now ah flying all my tudung then macam apa ni ten
lam soon singapore ke tadi
kurang ajar eh what
kita dah pernah kena judge lah that's why we don't we know how it is kalau people judge us
like sis pernah kena judge masa sis kerja dekat ah my previous workplace yang kat tai seng tu kan
ah I I apa after I started pakai balik tudung right
slowly lah I think after that dah dua tahun ah but it's still slow still new lah then masa tu ah I was judged by one of the co-workers lah dia macam
aku tak suka ah perempuan pakai tudung then I asked why lah then dia macam oh semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak jer baik but behind semua hisap rokok lah ambil laki orang lah I macam who are you to judge like macam just because satu orang buat kau nak judge aku macam itu
ya lah but it's not perempuan pakai tudung jer buat apa yang tak pakai tudung also buat what
so why are you judging just because we wear tudung wear tudung doesn't mean yang kita ni malaikat what
and then sis macam tak puas hati lah kena judge macam itu
step baik
kurang ajar sia
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are semua pun macam tak betul how
at first sis was like sis dah jadi defensive lah because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends semua tak nak friend with me
because macam alim begitu kan she don't wan't to friend with me sebab she say ah kau dah pakai tudung
then buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat
then I say to her lah tak semestinya that I wear tudung aku baik seh
I wear tudung is because I wanted
change for agama lah
like sis want to change like sampai bila nak jadi macam itu maybe if I wear tudung it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to macam jaga diri in public
like sometimes kita dekat public kita
you know like macam dulu I never wear tudung then sis pakai baju low cut and nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk tau
our intention is not macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun but nampak
so macam to me it elak fitnah
a'ah especially especially if you wear niqab
when you wear niqab right dia punya niat is to stay away from guys right to macam
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern nya days if you wear niqab instead you attract more guys
you kau tak normal apa like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
hmm a lot of guys are macam itu sekarang
masa yang si nurul tu kan then yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin kan dia pakai niqab kan
not the ex one lah the girl that she's getting to know lah yang dah kahwin
when she wear niqab dia nampak cantik lah like you will imagine her to be a cantik girl so many girls are adding her tau
memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab she is very she is wearing niqab what so she delete all her pictures yang tak ada niqab
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear niqab
but sis don't want to be macam tu but sometimes
ada apa you know in malaysia ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab
dia pakai niqab and then she's very young then macam nampak mata jer kan then she berbual very lembut very lemah lembut
ah then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like macam wah lemah lembut then muka kau cantik
then I when I was having this conversation with hafiz I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear niqab lah because the purpose of wearing niqab is to grown away daripada attention what
so if like aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku then lepas tu aku berbual begitu
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know kita dekat public eh bodoh lah like that
because sometimes when we wear tudung also our cara cakap also still the same what
err pakai pakai niqab
you nak jaga macam mana nak makan then macam like sometimes when we talk to guys like
tak tak open masuk kat masuk kat bawah lah tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah
then macam I say macam I hear perempuan pakai niqab I hear dia orang macam giggle macam gedik like I don't like
maybe because I have unresolved issue with perempuan pakai niqab
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue macam
like neelofa ah macam neelofa
so macam so
people lagi macam have a better understanding of islam
so if kau react wrongly people macam oh orang islam macam ini lah
then I've asked myself if I were to wear niqab then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes ah like macam to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like macam if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing hijab I am not wearing properly
so sis jawab apa
people will judge us name like makcik-makcik
mmhmm maybe we should maybe we should start doing that lah macam neelofa you know like
she change the misconception that macam oh pakai
purdah mesti boring but if she change ah dia tak macam sparkling macam
tak macam there's bling sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam okay lah
so if you that's why they say when you pakai benda ni you are sacrificing the things that women like most
cantik lah
then remember mak saying you know like when you want to wear niqab when you want to wear purdah
because you are attracting people like if kau dah buat macam gitu that is
uh for me ah in the future future kan I uh I rasa macam my age lah like my my age right now um is fifty so that means in ten years time I'll be like sixty so sixty it is like more to finding a very uh peaceful kind of um life uh I I just want to enjoy the nature uh macam suka pergi tepi laut lah tepi laut then uh kita tengok apa pokok-pokok uh then um and having uh just a a few number of friends you know
ah you know talk about your you got kids talk about your uh your life about you punya health uh like that lah
ah betul betul betul macam kita nak apa beribadah gitu ah banyak kepada mungkin ukhrawi lah
tapi sebab tu lah nak kena ada macam apa tu orang kata uh barang-barang yang ada kena-mengena dengan sains lah okay okay okay okay okay
dia tengok time lah
martial arts ke action movie because that is really cray you know to me
uh it really like macam excite you uh you really makes you awake tau macam tak mengantuk you know at least at least eh when you watch eh your mind is not really working
uh their apa ni their actions dorang punya lawan-lawan ah martial arts jadi macam
best lah kalau dapat tengok cerita-cerita macam gitu
tapi tu tak selalu sangat lah that one's only like once in a while only but then sometimes you you
you you want to also watch uh like macam family punya kind of
ah kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan lah pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada fit body
of of course lah you have the looks you know tapi kalau your body doesn't fit
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like uh macam orang kata tu cerah lah ah macam glowing kan ah glowing so I mean it is
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about uh what to eat and what not to eat you see ah jadi dorang banyak macam ah apa tu tengok lah banyak pergi mana tu uh makan fast food kan ah you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
uh they always think yang the important is to to have a good looks you know buat expensive makeup you know and then wear ah good good clothes you know so that they will look good
younger generation need to be educate mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu lah kena banyak membaca
and then ah dorang kena tahu lah you know uh
macam mana nak apa tu ah mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
uh do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no lah I think from from ya I mean daripada awal dah kena start lah macam choose makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua
it is not really easy to say lah okay it's not easy to say because we do not know ah what are the experiences that ah you know people uh I mean orang orang orang experience
ah pengalaman orang kan cause everybody has their own experiences ada background yang berbeza
so jadi um this mental health ni
uh I mean okay lah memang makanan tu penting okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like macam they selit lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar ah that is already dah important lah you know because even then
ah secara holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that uh but I I take vegetables I take also uh I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know ah depression ke apa so I I so I rasa that um
I rasa it is how you manage lah the situation
ah how lah you manage and you did also like macam talk to people uh with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters eh macam like when youngsters eh kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri lah kita kena bercakap dengan orang ah bercakap dengan family tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang very menjayai you know
ah jadi sesama lah you tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah you kan
so kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh accept uh the first degree of stress
yang ada ah second third degree pun masih boleh terima
ah ya depends on dorang punya capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents pun tak boleh push ah cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind yang
mm nak ke mana eh mungkin zaman kanak-kanak lah
mm ye lah kanak-kanak sebab zaman kanak-kanak macam tak ada stress gitu
ah zaman kanak-kanak zaman yang kita tak fikirkan apa-apa ah tak payah nak fikir kita tahu kita makan tidur main dah ah you see I mean
mm uh macam best lah kadang bila kenangkan uh waktu kecil-kecil dulu uh when my late dad was around ah how I spent my time with my dad and then uh apa tu
mm bila kita sama-sama ah apa tu spend time balik kampung you know a lot of things and as a children you don't really think so much lah about like
ah then you woke again then you you like play again you know ah you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people punya problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people punya problems ya macam those memories are I think are the best lah
uh there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them lah but as for me my own experience um if I have a timer like what you say you know uh where where where do I want to go I nak pergi tu lah the my childhood life lah mm
so jadi um what you say you want to go to the the ages lah okay okay
I think peringkat umur lah eh I think uh that that that is the reason ah why like macam you you are still young you know
orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak uh kembangkan lagi pengetahuan
uh kan nak expand kan lagi your knowledge so jadi
you rasa sebab you perlu pergi to that ages you know to nak lebih mendalami lagi uh benda-benda yang you tak pasti benda-benda yang you tak tahu mm
apa lagi eh yang kedua ketiga apa eh okay lah yang pertama dulu lah kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap
oh okay maybe um wang lah ah I think oh I nak jadi seorang millionaire ah bukan sahaja healthy tapi my wish
kalau I ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa ah I mean not for myself but I think ah I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity ah I'm a very like macam
then bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak ah kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang so I think tu yang yang can give me the most satisfaction lah itu second wish lah second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish uh seorang jutawan ah kaya raya
ah takpe lah you dulu lah what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
since I have uh children so of course I I don't really ask ah more like of course lah as a a parent you want to see your children ah succeed in their life you want to see your children like macam
have and will be a successful because the of course that is uh memang tak terkecuali memang you nak tengok anak you berjaya
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people macam sombong gitu macam apa tu
uh tak nak dengar kata orang lain you know macam terlalu ego ke so I
err tidak ada perkara yang uh kekal dekat dunia ni so jadi uh whatever that you have whatever that cherish it lah cherish it and also share share among other people
people will like macam apa tu ah respect you lah respect you
you know ah in this life right manusia manusia ni dorang ah memang akan tengok pandang tinggi lah kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua kan
tapi kalau you berduit tapi you tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga
ah you see so the best thing is uh whatever it is ya buat yang baik lah kalau you ada duit pun tapi you sombong kan
ah so tak ada gunanya lah orang pun people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant ah you know you have a
kalau ada superpower eh kalau ada superpower I nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit
oh macam flash ah speed lah
ah macam tu macam speed gitu macam whatever that I want uh I do eh I want to do in a very fast manner
then I I I clean up the house right like macam wah habis one minute gone or two minutes wah all the house clean already semua dah bersih wah see I I I
uh I mean like then you can have apa orang kata tu relax lama-lama
ah rehat lama-lama ah but unfortunately I do not have that such power
um tapi kalau ada
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use uh apa
ah you know senang semua but okay dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu flip flip flip the pages ah sekarang tak payah sekarang ah sekarang ah you tengok jer youtube
ah you google jer okay nak cari resipi apa masak apa ah then you know from then on can you can already uh find the recipe that you want
main problem like contohnya I think for adults eh adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know ah they know when to use it you know uh they they know like macam when not to use it you know they they they have the orang kata tu tahu bila nak focus tapi kalau children memang talking budak-budak ni you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age eh
you have TikTok and dorang dah lah macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok TikTok sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat TikTok kan
ah kerja rumah semua terbengkalai then homework pun terbengkalai kan and then uh last time eh you see uh budak-budak dulu they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them eh cannot watch television ah you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them ah you see so
ah you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you suka tengok youtube you suka tengok netflix ah lagi sekarang netflix selalu dekat phone ah you see susah kan kadang-kadang
nak nak nak stop ataupun kita nak ketepikan mm handphone tu
um pun ada good and bad dia lah maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of uh you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it kan kalau were to take over humans kan then what humans going to do you know certain things boleh lah kan certain things I think um can you know take over humans tapi certain like macam profession tak boleh take over humans ah you know I think certain certain professions lah not all professions you know macam doctor you that's why boleh jadi doctor ah macam mana jadi doctor
I rasa patient tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan ah you see ataupun nurses take over nurses I I don't think so lah that's why I tell you macam certain professions uh memang tak kena lah kalau I mean take over
still need uh you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine kalau take over abeh kita ni nak kerja apa ah you know how to earn money like that
see so kalau macam humans kan lain humans kan ah humans ada limitation ah dia macam sponge kan humans dia boleh adjust
ah you see so ye lah and and to add to that and to add to your ini kan questions you tengok macam ah apa maid pembantu rumah
ah you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right ah you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe lah can but then in terms of you talking about eh taking after the old people don't know uh how to how to really like macam like you say lah human touch they lack of that
use use the app for for macam good purpose lah I think for cleaning up no problem because like like macam you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like macam uh I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like macam
uh thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up um like macam uh you do the job cleaners and all that uh simple simple job can take over lah
uh you know but other jobs that require uh you know you need deep thoughts ataupun kemahiran ah macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar kan macam doctor dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar kan so takkan you nak suruh take over kan mm you see
tengok lah tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang when you talk about technology in years to come ah macam-macam kan technology akan datang so jadi uh we'll see lah that
mana yang lebih perlu lah at which at which sector
rather than you know like sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah mental problem sekarang I think kalau ada kita nak adakan lagi um orang kata untu menggantikan uh all the professions uh orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah mental health problem
mm and and and one thing and one thing pun I think um if you nak have this right untuk menggantikan the soldiers pun not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war ah kan tak ada ramai lah human beings yang mati mm

 tak dapat keluar negeri ah ah the before this ah  kat my my current  kerja lah when we did physical events ah the good thing ah like what you say we business kind of travel is
uh half a week or something then  balik dua tiga hari balik dua tiga hari balik that's what
ya just  tengok-tengok ah  macam ah especially like like it's the first time I've been to that country lah then  macam boleh jalan-jalan beli apa souvenirs lah ya ya ya but there there there's also a few time  macam with mah apa  pergi london or  pergi

so went err london bridge  apa london eye
 kita pergi paris is a train ride away ah ya ah no no we just went around paris ya ya
ya  agak I met uh one of my friend  kat sana so he brought us around  jalan-jalan
err then  lepas tu pergi um where is that
ah night train uh night train pergi uh uh brussels
that the good thing about that area is all  semua connected by train
ya so  kita just  naik the train from paris you go all the way to brussels
then spend half a day there then  patah balik
um then from there I actually we actually went to  apa ni manchester tengok bola ya I'm a big big fan lah
I will I will never leave I will never leave ah london without going to manchester and watching one game oh okay talking about that my profile photo  yang uh  tengah main bola lah  tu kan
uh  dulu Uber was in singapore
uh they have competition they said ah okay you answer a few questions and you win a a jersey man U jersey okay lah then I just enter lah I just enter and on the um the Uber app just enter my name my details so that uh was in the morning on on the work day ah so lunch time lunch time I  keluar makan dengan my colleague
then  tengah makan then  ada orang call  cakap uh hi mister alif uh I'm I'm calling from Uber uh you entered the competition
kan fine ah okay fine then  masuk later then in the car they had GoPros all over the car then ah ah then they ask question by question then I got all correct lah
 macam mana eh  nak kalau ah dah eh  kalau salah salah tak dapat apa-apa buang masa kan ah then ah  cakap okay lah nevermind ya ya ah
then I saw on this cardboard ah gambar manchester  gambar of the city and then they on the bottom they said you are going to manchester
ah then I was dah stun ah  tengok dalam hati
 apa ni takde benda apa macam ingat macam boot or apa ah player one of the player sign the boot or something because is is like a shoebox size
 bukak cardboard  apa itu aja but it didn't hit me you know I was was waiting  macam very slow reaction was like
what like  terus dah  terlompat-lompat kat situ
so is a is a is a is a um fully paid trip for seven days  pergi uh their
stadium  jumpa the player  pergi their training ground ah everything was
a fan lah ah so so that photo was actually  kat the their  apa ni training training ground their training ground so we we had a a a small football tournament between the winners from other countries
okay uh can no worries I I'll arrange everything so I went back to  kerja they are but said this was during lunch time so  lambat ah so I went back to  kerja I went to my manager lah first she look at me alif where have you been K ah I have a very cool story to tell you you're not gonna believe it but
you have to believe it I it happen lah so I told her the whole story lah then after like ten minutes of talking to her  dia cakap alif  kalau dah  lambat cakap aja lambat tak payah come up with all these stories
 cakap ah are you sure
so ah I just had that as my proof so-called proof so I  balik I told my wife my wife  pun tak percaya
then the the whole night I was waiting at my email reflect reflect check check check then about two three in the morning an email came in and it's the confirmation lah everything lah they need my detail passport  apa semua
I woke my wife ah you see you see  tengok see is real I'm not lying I'm not dreaming is real
ya this guy replied lah okay okay I I can take you I can take you okay we go then  yang lain semua eh  tak fair seh  aku tak tak baca pun aku tengah kerja ah I didn't read your message ah then sorry man I
we so we we went for one week lah that was time of my life man ya  jumpa
player free travel free hotel everything I just need to spend  duit belanja lah
from from mana ah ah
if central central paris ke the outskirts
ah ah ah okay the  ada eiffel tower
that that that time we  kita pergi night train from london
so  kita jalan lah  jalan around the area
jalan from the train the the
train  semua what what's the train say the
ah  jalan through the streets know sightseeing always  sampai the
um yup then some ya pernah but okay lah they are they are okay ah
then from there ah yup ah  satu naik stroller ah  satu the the smallest one ah ah mm
ya ya ya ya banyak halal ya ya correct
 dari from  apa ni the loop  kita naik dia ada apa the the river tour eh
ah river tour the the sand sand river all that  semua ah ah
ah ya ya ah ah we are  kita punya is just the the sightseeing just the  duduk-duduk tengok-tengok
ah then then  situ kira macam rest lah
we still have the picture the exact same picture that uh it was that was on the news  yang dah  terbakar
architecture we ah  kita kita jalan ah all the way  jalan
apa from from gare du nord  jalan around the area
the english guys oh  paris is dirty but to me  dua-dua equally dirty the difference is paris has ah more sightseeing places
the the  dekat-dekat first ah
then there's there's this  apa shopping mall  baru lah  apa nama dia they
 dorang betul-betul cater  untuk singaporeans but because I went there
 besar-besar lah the poster uh you can use Nets here Nets is a singapore thing what right so
literally every shop in that mall I think is paradigm ah I I can't remember the name you  boleh pakai Nets so it's obviously catered for singaporeans what
mm  nak kena tukar
I think out of all the people you know right like how much I love to use SIRI every like every err err everything that we want to search on google I'm always hey SIRI and dorang tak faham like dorang selalu macam give me some weird err weird like response
I macam malas nak taip okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life tapi it's like double job ah I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it tapi you you yang selalu macam
for their day to day like everything is SIRI seh because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more macam how do I say like err they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI macam everything tak boleh
kita just tak kaya lah kita tak kaya
ya so if my phone can actually macam faham what I'm saying from time to time it would be nice lah I would I would appreciate it a lot lah
ah okay okay let's think of a scenario okay maybe raya raya kita pergi rumah dorang
okay salam hey selamat hari raya selamat hari raya
oh I makcik I I yang makcik eh wah okay
okay okay you makcik you makcik
you pakcik okay okay you pakcik you pakcik okay
okay okay kita buka eh hello selamat hari raya
baik dari rumah pak ngah punya
tak okay okay jer okay oh sejuk sangat
oh okay lah so pakcik tu akan cakap err hey SIRI make it hotter
kan yes it like that always happens like what's the point lah honestly I tak tahu lah what
I hope dorang macam it's it doesn't become like one of those err you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy eh okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he err macam fell in love with the so macam because the became dia punya kawan like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels paling faham like paling understanding
something like that like so dia macam
very err macam
existential crisis kind of thing macam oh no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
it is kind of cool lah actually macam
it in this recording he said that tak tak dengar
I cuma dengar
no okay let's not let's be good citizens but anyway macam ah I think it's a good thing what he did only because like he made use make good use of the time you know of a bad situation he made it into a good one and
um like you macam lupa life before COVID mana concert err err indoor stadium ada
err you know what's weird like err I've been to concerts dekat big box and I feel ya
err err don't know but I think it's like the third or fourth level something like that and then dia macam um it's like a big
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is err like standing and I think it's weird because macam
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there tapi macam to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to jurong so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like err a bit more macam authentic singapore but
like weird lah to have a concert there cause it's like sebelah dia is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop tempat makan I guess macam what
it's like you ya you have to buat research dulu ah like you cannot straightaway
is it in the the food court or is it like macam like tempat makan on its own
oh oh like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much dekat sana is
the naan oh my god the indian food dia punya naan is I think two dollar fifty and sedap gila and like the dia punya ah butter chicken macam tak tak ah lokek super sedap
I know macam dengar you punya mulut macam berair liur macam you know
not for more than just satu occasion ya
oh okay pasal like it's every macam not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all kurtas are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
and mahal gila like kita pula dia
oh murahnya you shouldn't gotten that one
okay kedai apa because I pernah makan dekat tekka punya market and there's a certain stall yang sedap also like it's not bad
is it dekat entrance you know there's the bus stop
I menang seh
ya so I macam very competitive
and like macam you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I boleh I akan menang lah but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
mm like honestly same to me macam I'm not really surrounded with people yang
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends dorang like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature yang dorang not the most err not say friendly not the most social macam
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly betul-betul ya err before that I tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main monopoly deal also I tak tahu main
this is the thing okay the only thing I played eh a board games macam betul-betulnya board games macam meaning you are the board macam not card games or whatever first okay kita just board games was the game of life
I I think masih ada kat rumah but I have to find it
okay everyone will start at a point where okay kau nak belajar ke kau nak
ah start kerja straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions ah that will make you ponder about what to do next tapi dia macam fast forward gila ah sebab after maybe a few turns you dah graduate lah err then for those yang macam dah start kerja after a few turns towards the ending you dah ada anak you know you dah get married you dah ada anak so it's like it's very fast tapi it's quite fun err so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know macam introduced me to board games and shit oops sorry err introduced me to board games eh I wanted to ah bring that board games to
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me macam snake naik atas ke turun I don't know ah ladders boleh turun ke naik atas you know like I don't know which one is which err I don't know proper dice rules also macam err you know like if you um)(ppo get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think cuma ada satu dice satu die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends um but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
dia macam aeroplane eh ya I I ingat and I think I rasa I rasa I pernah main juga but I tak pernah
like research how to main betul-betul ya
like kita lend or macam like kita will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
it's the one yang you cannot move the thing right
whatever it is okay lah some people will think strategically dorang nak amek the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it eh all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this dah one hand and then dorang just lepaskan that's it
I think is I think as many I don't know lah but like only one person have to do that and then dia lepaskan kan so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one lah
ya which is okay tapi sometimes even the one at the top can tergoyangkan yang the other one
okay I tahu about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like macam is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
for a moment I macam
in my whole life I tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa so kenapa I cakap tu dekat you I tak tahu main chapteh no err I I think I'm pretty bad at chapteh err for people who can play what's that called yang the sepak takraw I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you pakai kaki like flick the thing up like I think sepak takraw is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play sepak takraw
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I tak tahu kalau the rules betul ke tak completely tapi basically like ah I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay congkak gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
kita ada this one corner
macam kampung-kampung eh like but okay
err with the steps as well like it was like err I don't know how to explain ah okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you tengah naik atas the ya to the to the macam what's that call like a patio luar the kampung like outside part of the house
okay ya the serambi and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets ah like shelves of games you can play so congkak was one of them
like something similar right okay lah dah tak special
so oh that one also macam macam eraser
err I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country punya flags ah
oh ya it's always like the hardest to find eh singapore err but I never had singapore punya flag
oh wow apa tu it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
um and hopefully it will happen lah but till then macam it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a macam okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
mm cause I think err macam uh in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
no like err macam I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe macam the planning lah planning maybe boleh
but macam kalau I nak buat sekarang execute everything sekarang I don't think I can yet
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you lah someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that macam kita dah discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
um tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her macam err buka her own ah no no not buka ah she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated dengan this satu sunglasses company
ah like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but err that's not my macam
a household name like okay like macam everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
such a global phenomenon macam and it's because kan like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right tapi the way she did it eh because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was macam err
macam maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain um products that are not the most friendliest to macam that kind of skin tone
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business macam like it really
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life macam I dah tak payah kerja dekat office I
dah macam my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries dah tak ada and all I can focus on is my business
but it's more of a personal thing it's not macam the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns macam to get return customers maybe that's one way of like um success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that ah
hundred K you nak tahu tak kenapa I tanya tu sebab kat instagram I wish I wish tak lah but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so kalau you boleh faham you boleh try to explain to me ah so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall eh kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the ah kourtney kardashian punya
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like err the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was um answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase kan like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people punya accounts tapi the moment the giveaway is done orang akan unfollow ah
but it's just that like kalau orang tu terlupa then maybe the account is still there
okay so lepas ni semua orang so seventy K plus like all the bags tau plus tau it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from
so it's like it's cool lah macam you menang you menang you tak menang you tak menang ah so I ask you that because I macam if I really menang what am I going to do like
it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so macam and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states ah florida or something it's not me ah they they said the results on friday I checked tak ada notification ya but ya like so um
I I think singapore quite mahal lah like
because the bags were different sizes macam there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
okay seorang wanita yang suka
oh okay bag bag beg-beg apa what's like the
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something macam my mum works at coach gitu ah then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I macam okay I got to humble down but no but basically like um I haven't heard lah ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I ni tak pernah masuk macam
sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah and very judgemental
err I don't know man I don't know dia punya price list seh like I think satu handbag eh
I tak tahu like
empat ribu probably gets you the small zip hmm probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I tak tahu I tak pernah so
just macam whether or not you'll be mm
I tak ingat sangat tapi
cause okay the only reason why I betuk-betul tahu there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the err the doctor from
no no cause macam the people who listening to this probably dorang biol like you know
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor punya salutation that's given it's not medical
I understand macam it's not something kita um
like something we want ah basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable kalau like you tak tahu the only reason I tahu is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it kalau I don't I don't know mm
apa kita tahu is just main game
ya kita nak main monopoly after this actually
sorry kita curse banyak seh
tapi I trust you lah don't worry about that oh
okay err in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that macam that is a plus point lah
err kentang the way I say it kentang goreng kentang kentang kentang okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately sebab to me macam a bit
in terms of food but we'll why because kalau dah nak keluar makan
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a tempat will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya ayam err ikan semua okay err so ya I think it's still pretty okay
just that andes andes sedap gila and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but kita actually dengar waiter cakap andes so
so macam usually if I go through anything that's not
so it like macam it reduces that err
that is not a good thing also jangan berhutang-hutang orang
tetapi err what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and macam really support you in times of need yes
macam mm there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
cause it's easier then later bila nak pergi kedai ke apa kan itu semua kan senang sikit apa macam I had macam
sekarang macam senang takut mengandung sebelah sebelah orang senang daripada jauh jauh daripada orang semua
eh tak lah merepek tak tak tak tak no lah
eh nonsense nonsense ah no lah then if like my other wishes is macam I want to have like a lot of money so I can do my business all able to do the stuff and all ya
ah nak banyak duit banyak
no as in cause ten K some money I save up and then I go like I do my stuff I do my own business cause nak
I don't wish to be that much to have that much straight way begitu you know I don't expect much even if it's a wish I don't expect much
then if it's you if you have this three wishes apa
oh sikit setakat kalau gitu the tiga wish is
to like tak nak jadi tua

tak nak mm
sekejap eh
ah there was tengah tengah duduk kat kerusi then I was like then then my kawan cakap dah dah dah dah sampai dah then I'm like okay lah then I
dah dah sampai then I'm like I was tengah duduk kat tempat satu tak bukan dekat dekat kat satu tempat ni agak library between the library there there's this
tak my kawan yang dah sampai
my kawan dah sampai
dah sampai then I wait there while waiting for her there I was waiting for her for very long then when she said that she dah sampai then I was supposed to go out lah when I was about to go out
my I was the seat was like so like together with the the tempat duduk uh tempat meja dia then the tempat meja tu then
dah pusing terjatuh then there was like five chairs peoples of full people like like there was like I think many people inside that place there was like I think thirty people already over there
they saw me falling but the best thing was that my hair was all face oh to my my hair was all to my face right so dia orang tak boleh nampak pun my face
oh cause bilik spare
pasal okay
recently dia buat dia
he did this one thing ah dia
okay and then afterwards yup ya tu the the other time different something that was something shadier ah
what he did was he like borrowed money from kawan aku cakap kawan aku lah ah this one guy
I mean I think you can guess lah who what what this entity is lah rather than who abeh
abeh lepastu then
kawan aku texted me
ah my our mutual friend dia cakap
eh apasal ada orang text aku
ni cakap owe money pay money rumah tenet nya
abeh like with pictures of his house and everything
in a bit I thought he was kidding ah cause aku saw the pictures eh ni legit sia
so I call him ah called my aku called tenet aku cakap dengan tenet eh
kau tahu apa-apa tak pasal ni please reply ah
abeh dia cakap oh tak tak ni semua tak tahu ni dah lama dah dah<malay>lama aku hutang abeh aku tak kasi nombor wafan which is our friend ah
aku tak kasi nombor wafan abeh I don't know how they got wafan number
abeh aku macam okay ah initially aku percaya dia ah then afterwards aku talk to my friend on the phone ah yang kena
eh afan kau ingat tak that time there's this one time ada orang tiba-tiba call kau cakap they are from
ah clarifying you abeh cakap ah do you know tenet
kata ya ya it's not my brother but that one my friend
macam okay ah
abeh lepastu ah ah then after we came to the conclusion that tu yang
that entity he borrowed the money from ah standard lah nak verify
you just anyhow give random person's number ke tak kan ya
so that afterwards aku macam oh
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend ni that he didn't know that dia would be part of this ah macam
collateral damage I keep saying collateral damage pe semalam
abeh macam we were just
abeh terus when I call him about it aku cakap kau tell me honestly ah kau cakap kau tak kasi number then afterwards I ask him
yang that time this one
shady number called my friend tu betul tak
what you claim it was ke ini
abeh dia cakap ah actually betul lah gitu then asal kau tipu
kau tell us lah when you already in this shit
kau tell us properly ah abeh macam terus sorry sorry kata dah clear
aku dah macam dah haiya
oh tu aku tak aku tak sure ah but he can go there ah
so ya aku abeh lepastu then yesterday eh this morning ke yesterday he said
I'm going to move out and by the end of the month aku dah macam
cause any harm to me or my family yet apa so I don't think it's fair
so aku cakap it's okay for you still want to stay here tapi like end of the month ke apa ah
ya by october that was the initial agreement abeh lepastu dia cakap eh yang dia nak extend until first december aku okay
then afterwards she said dia nak tukar until
eh no ya five ke march I can't remember
ya aku okay ah cause he's been a good
so far tapi then
one thing on top of another lah that happen to him abeh then aku keep telling him don't do this don't do this you want to do them not here
abeh well
what macam very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term nya thinking
you know you know those kind of people apa
snowball anjing
dia belum move lagi dia cakap dia nak
abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah lah
end of next month dah okay
abeh like he thinks that
I don't know he thinks macam ye lah paiseh ah
if he knew about shade kau asal buat ni semua kan
ya he should have been tapi
that's the thing lah that's as good as me using your name abeh aku tak bilang kau macam eh ah nak pinjam duit
you know aku secretly put you as the macam kau applicant ah without without your consent
tu shitty thing to do kan
abeh kawan aku tu gi geylang dengan dia cakap macam
not really doesn't have a place macam I dare not kind of thing macam kau lah basically
aku didn't really bitch at him about it lah aku tak macam bising ke apa lah aku tak
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront aku I I said
I'm not angry at you aku more concerned rather than angry lah cause I was not in the receiving end of this ah so it's fine lah
cause that time pun the previous issue pun he didn't tell me then I found out aku pun pissed ah I told you already not to do that anymore
macam it's addictive what
yes of course it got stolen abeh lepastu he was really bummed out about it
am thinking lah what to do now abeh ada other ah ada issues as well
no he borrowed me money abeh lepastu aku trying to recoup back the amount that he took
bab tu lah he's going to pay back I hope lah eventually
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us ke
from what aku understand ah my wife said the same thing you get me
farid cakap he would just salam me and just cam balik
I mean okay lah it's true ah macam you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
ah aku aku do feel that every time aku hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress ah now they divorced kan
aku every time
aku do feel
what I shouldn't be there okay lah kim said it perfectly ah cakap
I don't want to validate this relationship tapi I don't want to say macam eh you cannot hang out with us ah
macam I want to hang out with him
but then eventually what I did was aku just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
lupa ah good names
twenty twelve I think ah aku don't really remember exactly
tapi eh eh anal lah then okay anyways stress ah aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas think
cakap please boleh astagfirullahaladzim
tapi kalau just the
okay let's say it was just aku fahim and
lupa ah good names okay whatever lah bukannya ah okay anyway aku fahim and mistress lepak just the three of us the whole time
tapi this one whole group
tak usually we will know though
I mean initially my wife was worried lah dia cakap
what if you get tempted to you know macam add in to the dark side aku dah macam
to be fair kan aku only met his now ex wife lah very very few times I think
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
you know they don't have eh eh concrete plan to do whatever lah cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both lah
ya ya okay it is controversial tapi
but aku I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating ah this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family punya background dia macam financial background ah more than anything lah of course lah that plays a huge part
tapi okay ah to be fair
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not lah I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her aku rasa dia punya other other point
she aku tak tahu eh fahim ah probably it is ah maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is macam he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not macam many many many times
ya ya aku agree lah I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
aku macam how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
tak tahu ah
no some apa no no surprise lah where you came from like which country you came from
aku rasa that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
aku believe kan the country could do much better if the royal family
invest in infrastructure in country lagi sikit cakap company
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come abeh lepastu boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on ah
but they don't so aku found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
other things ah macam wan ah
so aku macam find that to be very thought superficial is one thing lah the other one is
lama sia
kau okay you you talk to the guy before kan
aku tak tahu lah abeh oh anyway dia cerita cerita abeh then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
aku dah macam please lah get on to your next point lah
ah aku tak tahu eh
tak tahu ah
ah aku find that
takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial lah eh he said this one line ah aku macam palm his face ah he said you know initially I thought
aku dah macam eh kau don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me lah sia
aku dah macam eh kau please please please don't give me a
macam there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see lah for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue ke tak if it's what you really want then go for it of course lah no one listens to my advice pe aku kan just an apa
which which she should have done from the start ah aku tak tahu kenapa she still engaged to follow him around
aku just find that very creepy
takde anything anymore together asal kau do this also I don't know
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying oh my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much macam you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her lah
macam aku don't agree with the mentality ah ada orang cakap oh tak lah ni semua kerja perempuan macam eh
ah ni ni untuk kau
tak you know some people would step up ah dorang macam believe that they are better at it
yes I do only aku only one t-shirt aku don't iron
it's good to have one kau at least buy a steamer ah
masai sia tak iron
um so aku
you know lose not losing weight apa
he said he was at her play ah their place ah her place there there so long if he was their place he and din this mat salleh melayu aku very confused
his balding tak penting ah but
both of them went over to fahim place abeh ah ruqayyah was asleep
macam aku gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain lah cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared sia to the point where aku realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it lah I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing macam
ya lah I I know lah but macam you can tell what there's a huge difference when you look at the photo macam from six days ago ke ten years ago
then macam
I really gain like twenty kilo sia macam you can tell lah pe the difference
I think for me aku at most gain about
ten around ten aku actually gain more initially then I aku started losing weight
aku controlling my food intake these days
aku don't really care what I eat more of
ya macam let's say aku the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
then the second meal let's say if you eat macam merepek minang ah aku just had minang again yesterday best decision ever
lepastu end up kau confirm lapar pe
ah minang then at night aku makan cereal
aku started at sixty six
tak not there's some most nya chart would say aku average ah
oh local nya eh
yup you have a point ah pasal the whole ya shouldn't have
I should look into the maybe atau kalau malaysia nya pun boleh pakai lah
aku tengok benda-benda bodoh macam dia cakap nanti ah
aku tak tahu ah
kau lain ah
ya takleh cakap sekarang
then they took a took a picture lepastu aku perasan macam
eh aku dah gemuk gila ke apa
then I macam
ya I show you before ya which which is good lah then I was not expecting that turn ah which really changed everything ah aku stop drinking sweet things exclusively I used to drink flavoured drinks exclusively and I stop
there's a while aku really crave teh then aku macam okay lah we go buy teh then I think so okay ah
not so lah couldn't not really heavily addicted to food kau tahu macam people some eat a lot of gluttony gonna shit I don't lah
german nya the vacuum guy
I think so but I forgot or you never did I am not sure apa dia apa dia buat
sardin pe
like some people tak change their passport semua they just
change for the heck of it macam kau tahu you get the conversion card kan
macam grudgingly ah
oh as in the whole ah like handling the zakat
oh ya ya ya tu aku agree ah I have to agree with that correct
so ni semua subjective pe
siapa they both
your dad ke your mum
who she she tak
is it one of those macam trial lessons
no some people think of it that way macam are you sure you want to stoop this low and want to marry asian some people which fucked up lah but then some people really think of it that way I can do it
ah so aku tak tahu ah macam maybe just tell her that
tapi if I know switzerland is doing ke australia forgot like german speaking country it's not

tak besar actually initially saya nak saya nak belikan briyani tau
pasal apa tau dia orang punya dia orang catering tak boleh masak sendirikan so dia orang catering
habis kita dua-dua orang masak macam dia orang punya lunch caterer tu all tu masak pukul berapa tak
pukul sepuluh malam caterer tu start masak
habis pernah satu kali tu dia orang macam dia orang gunakan psychology sia kat I
lepas I nak kena korek lima lima lima lubang
sebelum lunch
dia orang cuma sempat did I tell you the story
so that day nak kena korek lima lubang sebelum lunch

kecoh ah dia orang
helicopter pula
tadi apa hebah ni helicopter
ini saya kena design lah
K lah yang
this illustrator ke photoshop ke walaupun ada class tapi
belajar sendiri sia
I cakap dengan bapa that this sifat token of appreciation is not
mm especially bangsa dia
ah apa nama tu
it's like a feature wall belakang katil
satu nak macam like that
then depan dia you want to put your projector or what then it's up to you lah
nak frame apa
might as well paint sendiri kan terus tampal amacam
I don't want to put something like you know macam frame
kena kat kepala tengah tidur sakit sial
confirm sakit
confirm sakit
I thought you want to tear down the wall and then taruk dining room
eh dining room pula dining table
entrance tu kan nak buat ah ni
nak buat banyak raised floor
it does so that macam if let's say orang datang
orang duduk kat atas raised floor tu kan macam lepak ke baring-baring ke
a'ah eh orang daripada luar boleh nampak eh
mmhmm nanti jadi
kaum puak eh
nak buat raised floor tak dekat sebelah tingkap
on anzari had ada ah
okay how about that room the first bedroom tu
kita buat yes kita buat raised floor
and then kita
buat bilik tu macam our workstation
ya it's like macam
it's it's a macam mana nak cakap eh
okay dia
raised floor dia sampai dekat tingkap tu so that kita boleh baca kat atas tu kita boleh duduk kat atas tu kita boleh lepak
where you can even baring lah senang cakap boleh boleh tidur lah kat situ
and then dia tak tinggi sangat dia tak rendah sangat
correct so if you can either duduk or you can even baring
but it's near the tingkap lah then bawah tu can put books or maybe kita boleh taruk maybe some
apa drawer or something like that
okay remember bilik tu ada ada almari
yang almari yang built-in
pecah kan
we we make a table macam yang
ah or either way lah mana mana nya side lah so that is where our
ah apa nama dia
laptop and our workstation ah senang cakap
then at the side maybe we just pasang satu
ah satu apa nama dia
satu swing yang mount dekat daripada ceiling
we don't mount dekat ceiling lah then we buy the the one that with stand
we get the swing yang you know yang facing each other punya
you know the one yang kita lepak dekat
nanti swing tu goyang sendiri
tutup lah pintu jangan masuk masa I tak ada
no lah I mean the swing yang satu tapi the stand okay pe
if we are going to workout kat rumah
okay then maybe okay then maybe satu
ah for us to run ke apa ke
if I want to go for weights then I go to the gym yang dekat tu
alah then tak ada swing
tak lah swing tu tak bergerak sendiri lah
atau swing taruk dekat living room ah living room lagi nampak
the yang
mount nak kena pay extra eh
mount cuba kalau because if we mount kita tak boleh alih-alih kan
why do I want to alih-alih kan
if let's say ya macam like macam kat rumah awak
kan macam mak
from this side then dia nak change to the other side
ah lepastu ni sekarang dia nak change to this side balik
ah macam dia boleh change tapi kalau dah mount
dah tak boleh tukar dah tak boleh ubah
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down mana nak taruk tu
boleh memang betul but then
dekat wall the other side is not
wooden wall faham tak
dia boleh alih even with the console dia boleh alih
okay kalau kita ada console
we can move it to the window macam my house
ya okay pasal my house dia tak mount kan then on on top the console pe
ah so dia boleh alih-alih
so from there dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat wall atau dia boleh dekat this wall
so you can you can actually macam if let's say this year you nak macam gini then next year you nak macam gini
ah tukar mood you know tukar tukar tempat ke
it it might you know we don't know which which one yang
kena dengan kita pe
no lights can just tampal belakang jer
so the light shine dekat tembok
so it it if kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang lah dia tak shine
dia boleh shine boleh boleh shine tapi tak nampak sangat ah
but if you put on the wall kalau ah facing the wall
then the the light will show apa
will memacarkan
dekat wall
of course lah tak lah
tu dah colour colour
no okay macam let's say sini
putih eh
then sini macam grey
and then sini putih sini grey
so that it will look macam apa tau how to say eh
because your okay because you said you don't want the colour to lari jauh pe it's medium grey and light grey
so okay if you even if you put it together macam gini dua dua and then in the middle you taruk
you campur dua dua
and then you go and paste ah macam
mm mm ya ya tapi satu tub one whole big tub tu tak cukup satu rumah
kalau one whole house is about two
yang besar yang as in tub besar gitu tau
ah yang the one yang sikit hari ayah bawa balik ah yes correct that one two
kalau for the whole house
it depends on the colour juga
so yang chalk nya is like macam
susah nak hilang ah
oh macam macam you know the pagar yang colour hijau tu
pakai chalk sudah normal one
dia jatuh takut belakang tali dia pasang tali tali putus jatuh kat kepala kita sakit kan
might as well just tampal
tampal tak okay tampal dia boleh cabut
so in a dia tak stay permanently
I thought living room you don't want to put ayat-ayat
eh kentalnya tak nak ah
frame is so old school seh tak nak ah don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want
but if you put frame dah macam rumah pakcik makcik
tu jer I can say it looks modern but if you put it in a frame it looks old school
faham tak then that is a different story
okay then kat bilik ah
see kat bilik pun tak nak
so nak kena ada pergi balik
okay is it ayat as in ayat from the al-quran or ayat is just macam words of wisdom
since awak tak nak nampak sangat eyesore sangat kan why not put it in the dining room
where got tembok
masuk rumah is just tembok kecil sikit jer
ah tembok kecil sikt lepastu dah pagar pagar pagar pe
tembok tu I think I want to macam panjang kan sikit ah
then the yang yang satu satu satu tu nak buang
but then kita tak ada if like that then kita tak ada store
I know so I thought if let's say kita dah masuk then we make that store we make it as a store
and then our dining room kita kecil kan sikit ah sebab meja besar gila ah meja dia boleh duduk berapa enam tujuh lapan sepuluh orang boleh duduk
I don't know whether we still need store room tak because barang-barang besar kotak-kotak apa ke nak simpan
kita beli vacuum like vacuum punya kotak you know that kind of thing
then kotak-kotak tu nak simpan
okay so we kita akan kecil kan that dining room
so that masuk boleh jalan kat dalam
atau sini taruk barang aje then sini boleh jalan
nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu ah I mean I think by next year I think next year kita dah boleh buat ah
bomb shelter is semua rumah baru
kita nya bomb shelter is kat bawah blok
bomb shelter kat bawah
yang tempat budak-budak ah sekolah tu nursery ah that one is bomb shelter
ada uh I think kat bawah
mm tapi dia buat macam
I don't know lah but I don't think ada orang occupy that room
ah flat yang ada bomb shelter
ya because my flat ni ada bomb shelter untuk orang-orang yang macam macam daripada blok sebelah
blok sebelah ah nak lari
second room is macam taruk
maybe kita cantik kan sikit ke atau do some cleaning on it
so we just I think just guest room atau tempat orang nak solat ah dah
if let's say orang nak solat ah
even kalau dekat dalam study room tu orang nak solat pun boleh
kecil ah
but okay lah should be okay lah macam bilik amni
mm bilik amni is like that
ya kita nak taruk dia kat situ is katil yang
for now maybe my single bed ah single bed taruk sana dulu
because kalau
satu orang jer boleh tidur
tak kan satu nak tidur bawah satu tidur atas kan
takpe lah just
apa nama dia mm
katil queen-sized
just masukkan satu katil queen-sized
tapi nak kena swee swee kira menghadap
gitu lah so ada space a lot more space
so can solat down there
eh awak punya handphone macam jauh jer
tak tahu dengar ke tak lah but
because down there dorang dah buat
uh apa nama dia
dah buat almari kat situ
okay the the almari is L shaped
ah camne nak cakap eh it's like macam okay ni tiga room
letak sini dua then satu dua tiga
ah faham tak
rather than I have that might as well ada one two three
then one two three then in the middle put cermin
that place kita buat walk-in wardrobe
that short yang dia cakap yang the one that you say is short walkway tu kan
ah that one kita buat walk-in wardrobe ah instead of dia buat macam gitu L shaped
we tambah lagi satu gini tapi yang tu yang dalam tu the one inside
kita pecah kan
three macam gini
ah this like this wardrobe but three macam gini ah ni this is three
tak tak tak this dua pintu is three inside
then kat bawah sini ada
ah laci correct ah that one is one two three
then in the middle I want to put macam baju gantung untuk kat atas tu gantung panjang
from here to here sampai hujung
gantung tapi in the middle I want to put macam satu drawer
apa nama dia ah macam taruk jam jam ke
ah jam jam ke ah your accessories ke
can see through apa nama dia panggil tu
cermin eh not cermin
kat situ ah
because it's two faham tak it's two
so tempat siap is tengah tengah sini and then depan sini is ah
apa yang got space to walk of course lah got space to walk
got space to walk maksudnya
unless I want to take my baju lah
tak kan tak boleh tepi sikit tepi sikit
tak kan tak boleh
tepi sikit no
so kalau gini jalan senget
boleh pe
so the cermin okay the the ya is like this cermin
exactly beside that macam table macam gini tapi rendah sikit with a cermin
if you don't want cermin also can
then just satu table jer lah kat situ
satu table macam gini ah
like this kind ah like macam this this kind of laci ah
corner seat okay juga
then bawah ni semua is not our stuff
boleh juga up to you
can this one you want to take out pun boleh pecah kan taruk yang glass
but then not nice lah kan dalam kalau berselerak abeh orang macam mm
definitely berselerak
then the katil
my side dekat dengan tingkap
or you want to dekat dengan tingkap which one
then my side of the bed ada satu meja kecil jer bukan meja macam gini
dia meja kecil jer
bed side table pun boleh lah
mm then in sorang is a
ah apa taruk projector kan
kat mana nak taruk projector tu
tak ya your projector will project the image on the wall but where do you want to put the projector
you want to gantung dekat ceiling
or you want to gantung dekat atas katil
no lah I mean buat satu macam
not rak ah ya maybe rak
buat satu macam rak gitu then taruk kat situ
somewhere around here pun
waste of space might as well you just tampal tampal tampal everything on your
murah punya ah
if five room berapa how much harga dia
if four room berapa harga dia
tapi dia cakap five room
not my pasal what
correct what not my pasal what
tak tahu pula eh
if malaysia boleh
we also boleh mah
mm tak ada apa
check lah we check like macam bawah bowl ke bowl seat bowl tu ke apa ke
tak lah I think the sanitisation tak include cleaning ke
ah apa nama dia they will have a
jet no they don't need the jet spray you nak
dia nak scrub apa lantai
ye they have that they have that apa nama dia
I nak minum hot chocolate dulu
okay so kita memang dah tak
meat products as much as we did before I mean dua ribu dua belas eh dua ribu dua puluh dah kind of okay
so how how far lang nak go in to into veganism
I rasa
tapi in a way I think we're almost
I rasa
tapi I rasa I macam ada
selfishness sebab I don't
feel the same thing bila macam guna ikan bilis just because they are smaller than a chicken or lembu
ah I rasa selfish sebab they should be equal
ya ya ya faham mukbang
a'ah in a way lah sebab
I mean orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing is our companion pet banyak orang guna sebagai ah ada anjing as pet
manja lah binatang tu can be so is that the same comparison
tapi kita start dengan err hunting and gathering food from ah natural resource macam
dia pergi memburu semua kan then baru come this era bila orang start berkebun and jumpa teknik berkebun
wah I tak ingat
jadi kalau you nak go into veganism you akan
be a vegan lah bukan vegetarian
telur I cannot leave that I mean I
I boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu but I feel like I need my protein daripada telur
tapi the challenge
ah you I tak sure tapi I
the challenge will come bila balik rumah mama
masak apa yang dia masak lah I don't think I have the strength to tolak
because it's not something yang I boleh dapat every day
I I can do that kalau pergi kedai kawan
tapi kalau balik rumah family dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan
but I myself don't have the strength to tolak apa yang dah ada tu ah
ah and sebab I tahu
so susah ah
you macam mana
apa yang spark your idea untuk
err timeline ke
yang membuat you sampai ke part yang mana you nak jadi vegan ni ada cerita dia ke
macam cringe cringey
I rasa
yang betul-betul macam the moment yang spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
and because of a lot of things eh yang you bagi tau I lah and dia macam I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan kan sebab we have abundant soy sauce we have that err we have abundant soy derived products macam tempeh tauhu
mm sedap jer
ya lah sebab kita crave
spread penyakit ke macam nyamuk you you never know which one yang gigit you yang bawa aedes
extreme lah I mean I I think dua hari lepas kot I kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi
selain delving into veganism apa you punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu
kalau ada lah
I think ada kot
I rasa I rasa I punya azam tahun ni I nak
sebab I dah lama sangat tinggalkan drawing and sekarang I rasa janggal nak buat the kind of drawing yang I pernah buat dulu
janggal gila sampai sampai macam halfway tu dah menyampah tau
tapi tapi I I tau lah kalau kalau practise every day
dia makin lama makin okay so that's one of my
lepas tu I nak
belajar italian
and probably greek as well sebab tu pun dah tinggal quite lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu
um apa lagi eh
I wish I can say yang I nak seriously
belajar music but
but quit susah lah sebab I I don't have the same passion untuk tahu what's behind the system
ah dia not not as fulfilling but
atau maybe about
nak cakap lack of audience pun tak juga ah
even dekat rumah pun
dia macam not as motivated lah untuk untuk pegang musical instruments
just in case tapi kalau dah beli then tak main
apa ah my other resolution
sebab ah before this kita depend on performance and
if we have side jobs yang
then tu macam bonus but by by the end of last year dia dah turn to the other way round
memang ah memang more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way lah because I tak selesa pun untuk keluar and perform and jumpa orang in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still nak ada event takut juga ah
kalau you punya new year resolution apa yang dah boleh tiru dah I punya
berasa macam I nak belajar japanese sebab I tengok food wars tu tapi
better untuk focus dekat
tu lah
tapi so far italian is not that hard I rasa I boleh catch up balik
ah and I suka sebab macam once you belajar italian you can kind of faham french as well dia ada kaitan ah dia dia ada kaitan
quite beneficial untuk learn that one language
sebab dia boleh branch out to bahasa-bahasa lain selain language to apa lagi you punya ni you punya azam
uh I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore cakap the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself dia dah ada everything yang dia nak
I rasa it's not
and then ending pun
you you you you decide the topic pula
apa yang akan jadi in two thousand twenty one ah
I rasa akan ada
for sure sebab in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
ah dia punya
macam musicians tak dapat buat shows
ah ya artist tak boleh buat exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start macam
to make everything better for myself lah sebenarnya especially if that's their only creative outlet
dia redundant it's very redundant
but what about live shows I think um live shows pun dah start ada search juga because um sebanyak yang start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations memang
social distancing code scanning and everything so itu pun I rasa in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
I baca dekat twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
dia orang cakap your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
macam flu or fever side effect yang teruk-teruk
so I think I pun tak walaupun I takut jarum but I don't think I akan stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
ya lah faham
I mean even sekarang masa pandemic pun I dah tak ingat what happened in june in may
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic ni akan berlangsung lama and they cannot depend on skill yang dia orang dah ada so they have to broaden their horizon
okay can you explain pasal stoicism sebab I try baca tapi I macam
apa you punya philosophy philosophical standpoint
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you memang dah
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding tak sama so
once the border buka
scandinavian countries dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama european
bukan yang yang yang tak payah stamp passport tu ah dia tak termasuk dalam schengen countries eh oh termasuk oh then why
tapi I memang curious on how they can manage to provide
what about southeast asia or asia lah in general ada tak yang you nak pergi
ke kita memang western centric
I think sebab I think the the the reason is because
um dia orang preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit macam dekat sini most of them are
tapi asia I
nak pergi tak I nak pergi indonesia but but but the parts yang kita tak pergi before ah
I think tu pun interesting and for some reason
I nak pergi thailand sangat sangat sebab I rasa macam I nak dia punya street food
tu jer kot as for now
ah india but maybe bila umur dah lima puluh nanti lah boulogne and lah
mm selain tu
eh tapi yang tesla buat
the space flight yang you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
kan they dia buat dia buat this err flight flight system baru yang mana you can travel across the world in less than three hours ke two hours a'ah
so I don't know if that is still running sebab dia nak
benda tu affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years ke
balik hari jer pun boleh
I suka that documentary
centric tapi understandable lah sebab creator dia pun from
wah I punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam what do you want
you dah cakap you stoic so I dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu
apa yang you nak change
mm I faham
tapi tu lah I think I learn more
ah dekat dekat internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually kat okay I mean form five pun I don't have
and I tak pakai
hujung form five I pakai iphone but before that I pakai
ada laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use ah but I
I lebih I I understand bila ayah yang ajar
kena ambil to TOEFL lah lagi sekali
tapi tu lah dia punya price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so dia expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until dia expire macam the last time I ambil rugi jer
then sia-sia even if you dapat offer travel while once you nak masuk dia akan minta balik your TOEFL punya sijil then you have to take again
two thousand twenty one ni
kira start of the decade kan
bukan yang two thousand twenty kan last year was the ending
a'ah kita tunggu the fireworks
kita tunggu the fireworks but nothing happen
I pun takde expectation
that that one quite fast tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah
I harap
entah lah I don't have any
poll sekarang
like dia macam
tak dia from semua benda sebab
I tak rasa
macam you tadi cakap lah ah
afterlife punya benda kita tak tahu and it's not within our control kan dan ni pun sama it's not within my control so whatever happens happens lah
apa pun yang dia orang buat I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
tu jer
entah lah
tapi I I'm quite positive about
tak hopeless sangat
it's been awhile since I rasa hopeless dengan
the whole tahun
oh kaum is a very sensitive issue
and I tak suka tengok Facebook comment
dia almost macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu you don't have any feelings at all
ah bangsa malas membaca
lepas tu tajuk everything click bait
ah I wish that kena change
yang tu kena change
but journalism yang spark head
orang yang malas membaca tu ya malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun they have to click in order to know the
ni nurse yang nurse yang yang ni infected tu dekat yang vaksin mm mm
and then kismis dan
mm tapi yang news pasal nurse tu very misleading sebab even if you take your first vaccine untuk dia sampai ke fifty percent immunity tu dia ambil dua minggu
dia kena COVID within I think hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu it's not even two full weeks yet and even kalau dah two full weeks pun not a full total immunity
second shot baru ni tapi
and lagi pun journalisms sekarang mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then jadi satu bentuk berita ah yang penting ada content ya monetisation and yang penting duit jalan K
tapi content memang tak best langsung especially because the audience dalam Twitter and dalam Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
oh dah ni
lagi satu minit there's only one minute left
ah nanti kan bila you dah settle you click right ah tick ah
okay lah macam tak rasa sangat can speak one hour macam tak
wah so shiok to wake up on a monday to atas view of orchard and eat breakfast in bed in
it's it's in the middle of town but it's like the entrance is ulu but in town like like you cannot find the entrance like if you didn't tell me I wouldn't know where is it
no lah but at the rate like we are walking like ulu hotel entrance but literally in the middle of town is like
I think the only thing you cannot tahan is the toilet because of the frosted glass toilet
their customer their customer base quite like a lot what people go there and makan like I think because lucky plaza is cheap
ya the grandparents are both super cute but I think the grandma like err sit on the chair only but the thing is when you eat there right you cannot like chill chill you know like lim kopi like lunch hour people take their own time
ya ya like it's not like you're eating like super slowly but like sometimes you have the macam the luxury of eating at your own time own target but here maybe if you're not used to how their system is like the first time right the first few times we went we like oh ya cannot own time own target cannot choose your own seat cannot

tahu and all but but the bulk of it is tauge and I'm like she is eating one big plate of tauge I'm like okay healthy people
ya they're forced lah like die die die die must do what because like oh shit people know I've been gym-ing so so it's like if I don't show any result or something like quite lian</mandarin like quite embarrassing lah or like macam you know remember you made this comment about a schoolmate you said ugh she workout so much but don't really see much difference remember

like I think you really I don't know lah whether you need to like but then malaysia boleh so everything boleh you just need to have money
the younger ones ah macam the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still lepak lepak and like
no ada what remember during the circuit breaker the the the
the expat yang is it the group of expat pergi robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching what like kalau like kalau dorang didn't get send back home eh actually dorang tak kena hantar balik kan
exactly that's why this people expats all rich what boleh bayar
but then again right it's quite bodoh because you think about it ah kita tak boleh gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody boleh nampak
yup my cheeks are like oh my god it's like rabak
but then cannot do anything but it's okay lah the mask will cover so uh tutup jer muka and the trick is pakai nice eye makeup so the mata nice like lawa the
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because um nanti orang perasan
no orang akan perasan and orang akan rasa macam eh dia ni caring eh this person boleh dengar aku
no you cannot do this because all these mamat belok ni semua macam um
dorang is it bebal dorang bebal so
and also kalau even kalau macam um oh is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this mamat-mamat especially malaysia you must think like the typical melayu
actually I don't get it macam it's only in games mah like you can talk ah but macam why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
what is favourite buaya
bodoh lah oh my god he
what bila dia nak tidur then he play game and sayang sayang people
tak dia bini bini nanti kalau bini bangun dengar is it bini dia tahu
bodoh lah it's just like cari pasal
husbands game so much ah biar pe tak kasi attention lah tu lah ni lah
interest lor or like um like like their own free time ah you cannot just macam oh aku nak main game tapi kau kena make time for aku macam all that shit lah I don't know
while playing game how is the kid going to be concentrating bapa dia tengah main game
why cannot main game kat rumah
there's bodoh it's just like
ah ya lah dekat kita punya void deck bawah block like the the kind that government makes
dia duduk tepi road untuk main game
macam dekat park or like the estate
just to main game until really late
but then dia main kat keluar dia pakai data
apa tu err is it some flu vaccine thingy the normal one ah
it's only sakit because it's not like
ah I don't want tak nak takut
asal okay now I scared tak nak is uh is wait
no I went to the toilet what then you were telling the story then emilio also said something then I didn't really hear apa
no tapi apa tu kan is like err isn't it like penetration unless they put their whole fist inside then then
exactly so why would you bleed if it's only tangan
I think maybe they should try to lube people when they do pap smear jadi dia lube
tak nak lah give up
nanti aku takut lah like what the fuck oh my god alah now I'm like oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm gonna be like so worried
pekik or not huh
ah okay my tolerance for pain is teruk so I'm like okay now I'm like err oh my god
then I think the the thing about orang-orang yang first time kita semua bela sotong you know right
tak ambil epidural ke
oh the contraction before dia sakit
nak so macam pergi pergi appointment first time semua macam apa tu
err pregnancy first err blur blur pergi appointment husband pun blur blur
pasal awkward
ya nasib kentang pergi clinic seorang orang husband tak nak ikut
I told you what we had this conversation yesterday kan I say kan some husband check-up macam tak nak lah geli lah takut lah nak tengok lah tu lah ni lah tapi semua nak bila nak ambil semua nak
got lubang any lubang also can
everything lubang just lubang
at least the mum ikut I think it like kalau kena
you eavesdrop dengar apa jer
as in budak tu nampak dah pregnant tu tengah oh
tapi the youngest yang aku nampak
she's turning twenty one next year habis anak dia turn seven and I'm guessing tak habis school lah right
unless err defer sekolah atau pergi sekolah until like you're thirty eight thirty
no you can differ what macam skip school for ya lah macam lepas beranak she can pergi sekolah then mak dia jaga lah
fourteen what the hell kau beranak fourteen empat belas tahun empat belas tahun you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right kau beranak like oh my god kau beranak at like enam belas tahun or like maybe uh enam belas tahun onwards kau beranak is still considered teenage mum
kau beranak at empat belas it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was I was waiting for my menses
err maybe their pull out game rabak lembap atau uh atau err because oral contraceptive kena bayar condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
you bodoh lah just bodoh
eh but then again there are people on or like even the tubal ligation then tiba-tiba mengandung
no sometimes it's quite uh quite err oh ya after the menstrual cycle entah lah tak tahu
and then ya is people all this whatever lah I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like tak gagak sia
why would you why would you do that tapi kan she signed on to army so is like
empat belas tahun catch no ball with a son to look after
the sperm stay inside bodoh it's like
because when they do sex education we are asian dorang tak nak cakap oh korang tak boleh ada sex with like condom but kids are not stupid they're watching porn eh eight or nine years old
huh but all kids have phone now what you know even if they don't know how to search right you know sometimes like let's say you know like you watch show habis ada pop up
okay so after that the third year engkau move out because with your aunty and then
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
tapi when you go back that time uh like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
ya ya but you and her now dah okay lah
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree lah you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life lah mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy lah you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my nakal my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school lah they get into they they start to steal from shop lah that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument ah so aku suka jawab jer you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum lah you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course lah you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you lah you know you ended up becoming a fight often ah but for our case is not religious matters lah for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche lah because she was a single mother for awhile
ah so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so macam ah ya ya so I can understand her stress ah she was the old school hard knocks kind lah you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind lah if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness lah so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and um I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
ah when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two err I stayed at uh you know those government rental house ya I I stayed uh using uh someone's name lah ya because that person had was sick so she uh the nenek like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus lah ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely lah I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area uh my my house was at outram there the old school jalan kukoh lah you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better ah
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot lah and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay uh when when I was in my early twenties kita actually nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah so by right we already moved to yishun way back already tau but then err this err it's a it's a chinese family lah so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house ah so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room lah my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us lah but you can feel lah after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like rimas if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate lah then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you lah the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight lah like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve tau but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her alah she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke you know
passionate ah kira defensive ah
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example lah uh you know like how sometimes people um okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very nya one the nya one ah actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before ah wah sometimes when people in the level of managerial position ah are sometimes very guai lan you know bro dia orang
ya lah but no lah I truly mean it empathise lah kau jangan ketawa now you make me feel bad for laughing
eh but dude I thought all this while memang you were actually very motivated to be a pilot what no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about macam mana kau jadi pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid tau not the interest tau the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
oo sayangnya
eh no lah because new house you say you use mah you don't have to cash contribute what ada how much
eh but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know nasib kentang eh like like first okay lah the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID pula happen like wow
your nasib is so kentang lah dude
nasib kau sangat kentang bro I don't know why I say kentang ah but I feel like it sounds right nasib kau kentang
another ujian
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to salihin ni edwin jadi nyanyuk ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there orang yang dalam asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you siol lah funny sia
siol ah kau
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story lah I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist ah so she's like a old lady lah you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage lah like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just macam smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing what you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you kena arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you kena arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing lah as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see lah
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand mah so aku anytime can just like you know eh
he's a new zealander but sekarang he stay in australia
no it's not about mahal bro even if it's not mahal you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand macam mana if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example lah like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and um I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say oh my house will kena tarik they will say oh I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
the only reason how they can tarik your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house kena tarik not true okay number two uh you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy uh I give you one one scenario lah one of one of this person oh like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount lah so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
because your will still cut mah bulan-bulan for the house ah okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you ah bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years lah depending on the amount that you have to pay err so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that one right they are the people like ah fuck it lah I don't want to pay aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat ah so if they never pay then they cannot travel
but it's not like so long in advance pun you know it's just like a day probably you know ah but the thing is people thought oh cannot that kind of thing
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will tambah balik one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario lah so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay lah let's say you you a newly married couple lah okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans mah
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay habis kan another thing kan macam the second way let's say macam the minimum eh some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the susu pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come lah lawyer letter come lah
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic ah this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see lah they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country lah ah so ah normally they have their debt consolidation plan lah that debt management program lah all these thing lah this is by the by the banks lah of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria lah you know you are eh aku rasa dah habis ah bro okay lah five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done ah okay
habis I letak blanket
and then baru dia tidur betul-betul
mmhmm rimas
bangun pukul ya seven tujuh setengah
lapan gitu but she starts school at nine so macam kelam-kabut ah
dia punya bapa lah kasih makan benda-benda macam tu
uh dekat dengan changi airport
like my mum nak pergi sana because my father have something on
ya on friday but then after that my my father replied to the group chat dia cakap uh nanti first december ada hundred dollars singapore rediscover vouchers habis terus dia buat muka silly face means dia tengah hint hint dia tengah kasih kita clue yang dia kita tak nak
yang dia tak nak kita pakai that
yang kira tak nak kita pergi staycation
aku baru jer baca tadi
dekat article kat goodie feed
I not so sure when but I saw the article then I read it dia cakap tak boleh stack the vouchers
mm mm because bila you nak book kan
distractive seh hutan-hutan dia
yang menangis macam suara dia macam bayi or orang besar
oh maybe couple tu lah tengah gaduh
apa seh entah-entah nanti dia pakai benda tu dia boleh track kau dekat mana
seram seh
I read but I that's then they showed the video lah picture lah oh my god when they show the video ya and they talk about the small kid yang budak kecil
ah jenguk-jenguk kat lift
habis I macam oh no then I letak
telephone jauh-jauh kan macam tengok macam itu like scroll scroll like that tak berani sia aku tak berani nak tengok budak tu
jenguk-jenguk dekat lift
tu ah tak berani kalau let's say kalau aku ternampak and then budak tu macam mata merah ke apa
seram sia
dia ada dua alam dia naik lift
tapi dia asyik pergi the same floors
kau nak ciao pergi mana kau dekat dalam lift
oh my god sampai macam tu sekali
then lift tu buka ada nenek dekat situ
suruh dia bawa masuk makanan nasib baik dia tak masuk kalau dia masuk aku rasa dia stuck
kan a'ah tapi dia tengok macam lain macam
then dia tak jadi
mmhmm tak lah I think because maybe
ah nenek tu kan tua so macam nenek tu suruh letakkan dekat meja takkan you tak nak letakkan tapi dia punya situation is like so scary and creepy until the delivery rider ya
tak percaya ah
so tak ada so kira dia jumpa orang tu dia tengah kejung ah
tapi tak ada tak ada any response
I mean kenapa masih ada seh I mean orang tetap beli
uh ah sebab kita orang nak tengok the farms and everything but then tak jadi because my father have plans at the airport there
ah bila
bangun pagi nak ambil wudhu kan nak solat and then I was taking my ablution and then after that but this was in my mother's toilet because I was scared
ya it's so scary then you know I after that I have been seeing like uh lembaga
lembaga dekat through reflections like
thank goodness ya at that point of time and then like I've been dreaming I've been having nightmares and then in the middle of the night I woke up seram sejuk so I pergi my mum's
my mum punya bilik
keluarkan gigi ah
ya lah and then we that time ah we are going for a gathering dekat
dekat tu ada
then I tengok dekat sebelah

what do I like oo I like comedy oh damn eh err superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so aku rasa macam group macam a bit too much gitu
macam you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
dia macam a bit awkward
um so dia
so like the way that he act macam
macam half-hearted gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu

aku boleh pilih ah dia punya
macam tak biasa ah
eh sial lah aku tak belanja sia aku sedih sia cause last year last year aku macam bingit sendiri dengan sendiri tau
err aku tak ada duit kalau aku kan kerja kan eh aku tak kerja aku sekolah
so aku fikir cam simpan dalam apa dia punya basket eh shopping cart dia
benda-benda yang aku nak beli takleh afford
sedih sia
err entah macam
aku rasa aku terbawa-bawa dia punya feeling for sebelas sebelas punya sale
macam it's nothing for me um macam I don't have to worry about eleven eleven because there is black friday
because at the point of time last year black friday aku beli benda so but eleven eleven tak boleh sekali masuk kot aku rasa
kau takleh ni eh macam err collaborate
apa right right right
oh benda dia jalan
anting-anting jer kecil besar
macam stud gitu ah
sembilan puluh lapan siak ah beli kat shopee lagi berbaloi
repurpose ni kan kedai ashley lah mmhmm
eh but then if you take like macam for example if you take like the buttons from a top a blouse for example Chanel buttons how would you know it's actually authentic
belum sia eh kau tahu kan yang one thousand note dah tak boleh pakai
okay bukan tak boleh pakai it's more of like it's obsolete now um so like whatever that it's like remaining out there in the world whoever has the one thousand ya so uh laki aku cakap simpan dulu atau buat investment boleh jual kat carousell berjuta-juta dolar tak aku tipu jer so I don't know
like apa ni
err apa emas
kat cash converter eh cash converter betul lah money max situ ah ah maxi cash

ya simpan duit dulu ah
ya sekarang tak boleh belayar pergi mana-mana kau tahu pasal yang travel bubble
ye ke no lah I think like I mean it's more like commercial travel but um
tak normal like normal nya allergies jer
sakit ah sampai nangis semua
serious dia
laki kau kena block rabak
kirakan kau dah biasa ah
oh dia pun
tapi macam siak jer
dia gardener
damn oh kirakan dia dia kenal tu market
cam dia dia buat survey tak pernah beli
oh pandai juga eh because I have no idea who wants exotic plants I never met anyone
so dia baru start ke
apa nama dia mid-life crisis eh
mm dah lama kan I mean bukan lama sangat lah
macam a few years but
I think it's a thirty thing ah you start to reflect on your life and your parents dia bukan muda lagi
asal kau fikir gitu sia
aku rasa at this point in time
comparing to like our twenties kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu
and we're in denial of it macam other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like aku cuba ah solat subuh like susah sia nak bangun alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
aku bingit sia selalu adamnya ringtone kan it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying dia punya vibration dia just semacam tau
its more mellow so bila aku bangun macam like oh bird you know its much more
compared to bodoh punya handphone
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok belajar eh so I came across this Tiktok with post err they were mentioning about like err
my kesalahan right kesalahan aku it's not
on my husband's punya shoulder
my my kesalahan is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like tegur
so like it's the same thing as wife lah so sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh part tu kesalahan aku lah
so aku macam like aku tahu kan husband aku tak bangun then aku bangun kan dia so asal kan aku kejut kan dia kalau dia solat ke tak solat
okay aku tak tahu but that's how my understanding of it lah
like time kau bertemu janji
kau fikir macam like oh ah aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then kau bingit sendiri
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara
ah kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam oh aku tak sayang dia so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me lah but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume aku aku macam in a way macam a bit
so ya sometimes dia macam hint hint hint then aku macam like what is it that you want and dia dia macam he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then macam like cannot make up his mind his decision then aku macam bingit ah
oh kau kau tolong dia ah untuk hantar barang-barang
tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang like perasaan semua then apa dia cakap
untuk kau kot the way that you say it
dia mat teruk okay
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card bila kau run away kan swipe
you you you run away now you deal with it later so nanti dia accumulate accumulate ah then one day bam oh spark fire
eh dok Tiktok aku dah obsessed tau dengan Tiktok
tapi itu tak pakai that kind of idea untuk business kau sendiri
orh itu lah inspirasi kau orh dia filter tu glove putih glove apa lagi kau nak
kau tak ada glove oven sekali
yang penting aku angguk muffin
mungkin kau punya hidung boleh ni ah boleh sense kau tahu yang mingles dia boleh sense the weather berapa degrees
err aku kena unlock phone jap eh
um nak masuk tiga puluh lima minit
okay kita harus berbual
lagi sikit lagi jap maths aku tak bagus
satu jam enam puluh minit kan betul lah maaf ye saya mengajar seni lukis okay siapa eh
months adam has been obsessed with like watching documentaries so every single night before we sleep but he finds it as an entertainment so dia tengok um macam YouTube nya video semua
abeh dia ketawa-ketawa sendiri aku bingit lah macam like sial ah sis nak tidur sia kau takmo ah abeh buka kuat-kuat pula tu bukan nak pakai earpiece
then bro ya so like err I mean it's entertaining to them because like you know trump super confident so he's like in a way find this macam like a a filler for him to before you sleeps ya so aku first macam annoyed ah but then like err it's one day one night that I actually joined him is quite funny actually cause of the trump being himself ya allah
ketawa siak
kesian dia eh
kau nampak dia punya post

kawan ah
err ada tapi dia dalam aku
so but tak banyak ah cause it's
aku tak tahu aku tak ingat ni semua adam punya ya cause okay aku tahu this is not a good way to do it but because my husband is a agent so aku serahkan semua kepada dia so macam like uh my mother is a bit upset ah macam like okay mean
um everything on the table what if you know what if what if right so that would be on me lah if let's say anything happens but aku sekarang macam like nak tahu benda ni semua pasal insurance investment aku macam segan sikit so bila aku nak tahu nanti aku tanya because it's just that that's why can you stop asking
dia ambil from the

but is that they want to like macam lessen dia punya
camne nak cakap eh
to the free time I won't say free time macam
dia ada kerja mana ada kerja sikit it depends on how you see it
sebagai cikgu aku rasa aku suka yang lama punya because it's much more as in its more pro for teachers rather than the kids because the kids would be more stressful ada tiga major tiga exam tiga peperiksaan ada common test ada mid year ada end of the year
aku ajar art jer
aku rasa untuk budak lah menarik because like the fact that they know that this err the first three weighted assessment is not as heavy as last one so they can learn at their own pace but some students especially the sec ones
dorang macam like
rasa macam like dorang dah like gerek ah macam like eh tak payah belajar then ni ni jer buat buat quiz jer buat group work jer ah tak payah kita relax jer ah until they reach to the end eh bila macam september sept holidays eh sial lah next week ada peperiksaan sial lah aku belum belajar eh sial lah apa sia tu aku belajar dari january tadi ah so dorang panic ah so if they would have to grasp they if they have grasp the concept
of the this topic that they have learnt in err in from january onwards right then you don't have to worry you ah but kalau dorang macam like ah aku tak kesah aku boleh belajar procrastination and it won't do
online tak online dorang tak belajar langsung
siak aku bingit siak nak ajar dorang online satu ah selalu problem apa camera
cikgu tak boleh nampak ah cher cannot see you pasal aku tak on lah bodoh its like err okay teacher cannot hear you then you unmute lah ada message cher I just woke up
kau ingat apa invitation apa so macam err
um I will have to ask I don't know why macam like aku tak tahu pasal err budak-budak ni kan dorang baru bangun ke tak biasa dengan online punya attendance taking so dorang macam lemak sikit
example eh budak-budak ni nama dia azmi
dia tak dia bukan online ah dia dia dia dia tengah tidur ke apa
okay can anyone call azmi please terus senyap
um everyone can hear me right nod nod will be nice tak ada sikit ah satu dua tiga budak aku nod okay can you call azmi senyap
then aku macam sial ah apa siak
kau tahu aku kena call azmi pe sekarang then lepas tu aku type dia punya yang class monitor ya aku err tapi dorang tak respond I don't know they are scared to talk online or something to show their face oh my god so difficult aku tak tahu how ugly they look dude I seen you in school I know how you look like for goodness sake nobody cares oh my god aku nya online tau aku busy online aku pilih debate so technically its gonna be very hard the thing is we talk and we need to see each other face
to react on the on the reactions lah ada budak perempuan ni err kat rumah kan so tak payah ikat rambut ah boleh rembang kan semua aku rasa dia baru habis mandi dia main rambut dia kanan ke kiri twirl twirl twirl abeh senyum-senyum sendiri kat handphone eh sial ah aku bingit sia aku ambil video abeh aku tunjuk kawan-kawan aku
super annoying why she trying to flirt with me oh my god I I dah stress then lepas tu aku message one of the err the student in the senior aku message eh tengok kena annoying aku cakap dia suka budak err yang dekat eh dia cakap ah ada satu laki dia nak cui
dia tengah so annoying oh my god gini gini sial lah aku takleh concentrate sia
pasal some kan that point of time they were having like like err field training so the coach was lecturing tak kan aku nak excuse me sorry ah
tiffany can you stop moving your hand left and right aku tak buat gitu eh aiya how sia tangkap jambu ya allah

um entah girl ah jap lagi lagi sikit jer
tiring eh just now I pergi kerja then it's like it's black friday so store is like so many people
masuk because the store is too full scared like there's health ambassador will go round
um I so penat I just I just went home straight
but too bad lah tak ada duit haven't gaji
I tak sure probably maybe I save dulu wait for another pay
nine wow kerja malam eh
mm tahu pun your fault
I ada project I ada exam so I have to like
sekarang the
the the first project was actually video editing then I I was like really rabak ah
I have someone to depend on kalau I tak tahu then you
dah lepas intern what's your plan
kerja part time ya I think most probably I'm going to look for like a full time job so I'll be like more secured you know
something like or engineering end up you nak go to like something yang tiada kena mengena before you studied
higher NITEC cert but I rasa kalau dah dapat diploma
tak apa lah like oh tak mahu berbual pasal kerja lah stress
the first place I want to go is actually just I nak
shopping and makan and just relax but it's like the nearest at least
like you buy your groceries ke you beli makan ke or you like even if you just uh stay at hotel over there
you dapat save money
I just wear anything selesa
um it was actually my first time pergi korea but mostly I buy is like their skincare cause
then you kalau like
there's in this if they continued the season four but haven't watched like I'm just going to let all the episodes keluar dulu then baru I tengok
wah inspired inspire apa
selain anime
like come on like you don't know like uh boys over flowers like the are are you sure you pernah tengok itu semua kan
ah I love but sekarang pun okay lah they still funny but
I don't is I think left with jong min I think if I tak salah lah
then from there like I get to know yang dia actually dalam A pink a girl group like so cute like you know like she totally got talent
bila-bila masa I watch soccer
like I I don't really minat soccer or football
I'm not really cerewet you know cerewet like about food
I I usually just eat just that the one thing that I don't like is asam pedas
if I see asam pedas I'd rather you know starve
but it's okay lah tak apa
malay food I eat it's just I tak suka asam pedas but if fast food
like no matter how many times I eat or how long I makan already I still go to McDonald's
like I'm sure I'm sure everyone favourites is McDonald tak ke
um selain McDonald leh
apa lagi eh
I suka
I suka anything yang macam chicken macam Wingstop ke Nene Chicken ke Four Fingers ke
but itu semua like if you eat
a lot of times you get jelak so
I think I have been I think is it the one yang
they got sell like all the you know the mee goreng mamak combo is it with the cheese fries is it is it is that where adam's corners is
hmm is there like tebu over there you know tebu
no lah bamboo and tebu is lain
tebu is sugar cane
apa lah
okay lah so jadi over there I should get like the maggi goreng combo
uh no ada dah dah habis dah she ya I think if sekarang I think is every friday I think the
the cerita is uh I think is called
lesung if I'm not wrong you can try you can try uh tune in every friday dekat suria
like I feel like I watch once a month sahaja no lah I'm not into
like the drama and all if I watch also I just watch it through like Netflix ke Viu or YouTube tu jer
now now I tak
tengok apa-apa cause I like actually I am busy
like morning kerja then
bangun makan tidur kind of thing you know
uh still still lama lagi I think now like
ah like you know like I say myself is chill but yourself is called you know cari nahas
huh you tak sabar nak pergi malaysia I can't wait to remove the mask
really cannot tahan already people really need to follow like
ah cannot be anything I'm sure like mesti dia macam
ya but you can only use your own voucher I think you must add up with pakai cash
go sentosa untuk apa
dia naik habis suddenly dia turun
what tak ada kena mengena car and roller coaster
who said I tak suka car I like car
people boleh bahagi masa dia orang to to be into this
so let's let's just tahan a bit
like you know there's you people say macam uh there's like there's a
or apa the rainbow comes first something like that lah I forget I lupa
the job punya name if I'm not wrong it was apa tu
it should be ah or siapa-siapa yang boleh faham ah melayu
ya but the job punya
the job punya description wah was not that not that bad uh
transcriptions oh sorry err listen to audio punya files
no I think it's like maybe macam punya type of thing uh
ya ya basically ah but I think there's also another aspect of macam
err natural language processing punya
because kan you know ada ada debate kan whether language is
err nature or nurture macam whether there is a biological foundation for language
the brain punya mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke tak whether the can learn
because my results kan belum keluar
if I apply then like a bit weird uh but I'm quite sure I will pass lah so I think tak ada hal kalau nak apply jer
special education punya teacher
because I fall into the macam the
only one exam was quite difficult uh the other three macam
gitu-gitu jer uh okay ah I did two of them quite well err
but at the same time kalau dia rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest punya score possible
oh so macam what are your strengths what are your weaknesses gitu ah
wait he got cut off oh because the break up room punya time was ending
sebarang jer siol leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the benda ni compulsory kan
belajar belajar all the way like for hours and hours straight
for the eighteenth century punya lit
it's work for me throughout the four years uh for all my lit punya courses ah plus I hate lit uh so
biar lah dia
tak menyibuk lah dia
left maksud
oh kejap pause
but the appointment pukul enam pagi
nak kena siap apa seh you just need to go over to the location pe
okay so he's not actually baru ah macam gitu
so so your shift doesn't deal with macam punya barang-barang ah
apa and oo
kirakan dia lost ah
kita orang macam chair destroyers eh
I mean even on your off days also most likely kena tidur kan
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift punya thing uh pasal dulu nasri pun bila dia tengah kerja shift
macam even on his off days his time was taken up by
tidur dulu because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
wait so so you mean different punya clients
I think especially because macam lain-lain punya organisation ada lain-lain punya processes
so macam
solid base to work from within your own organisational punya itu
like it's dependent on the client rather than the itu
what what do you mean kena macam tu eh apa
first come first serve siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu
pukul lima five in the morning
and you don't want to be the kind yang
tanya tanya tanya macam oi you want or not eh you want or not gitu
like I have a feeling like usually the one yang step up is you and not all all those other people yang itu
pasal kan ada apa budak baru nama jaden kan abeh seniors dia jaded
so jaden dengan jaded sama-sama
never mind never mind let them cringe janji janji kita punya audio dorang dapat
no no no it's like it's like bila kita orang dua orang jer berbual macam
kalau orang melayu apa ah
ada ada ada there's a there's a uh there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
macam like like ah is it
is it kayu tiga
I think it's kayu tiga
oh okay lah betul lah I mean we we're having
I mean maybe the design of dia punya blocks also plays a part lah
but at the same time tak kan you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time orang nak balik rumah
tak kan orang sia-sia jer ketuk-ketuk siol
banyak ah anime
weeaboo kalau melayu apa weeaboo
kalau indo weeaboo
part dia pun belum sampai dalam anime dia
they had they had to stop for a while pasal COVID
uh apparently january next year in japan lah tapi kat singapore belum tahu ah
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own macam
cinema punya based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of uh apa
err to do with the film ah let's say macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself abeh nanti macam
tak lawa ah dia punya tu
ya ya that's the thing macam kalau film it's like
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel punya density
like with digital all like you are constrained by dia punya
the pixels ah and the resolution that it was framed at ah macam you know lord of the rings
is because dia punya digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
takde ah but it weren't limited like if you if you film
but all the and the extra extra punya barang-barang
was err ten eighty P punya rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether apa tu
dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya effects
or whether dorang nak apa
err just use the existing punya rendering
and then upscale to four K tapi macam buruk ah macam zoom zoom in gitu ah that's the kind of effect
ah ya ya ya macam stretched gitu
tunggu ah dia
ah ya lah you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script macam mana dia punya scene develops
you know like the three quarter removed punya angle or like
macam the kubrick punya
stanley kubrick punya follow through the halls
no tak nak tak nak
tapi macam kenyang ah boleh ah Gong Cha
how to work the camera to achieve that itu
I think director director macam gitu is
dah successful dah ada banyak duit then
the ego that comes with it is itu uh
I think it can go anywhere ah doesn't necessarily have to be macam
horror or itu it can be like it can be like drama
the person and the nature of the person macam who are you gitu
macam telling you
the the thing that I like about the original punya jurassic park is
that that err that apa
it kind of moves beyond macam like what what constitutes
like how you know there was a scene of the guy yang dia dia
err apa ada T-rex
then after that dia abandoned budak-budak then after that dia terus dia lari masuk toilet then T-rex gigit kepala dia
it's like err macam
I only remember the beautiful shots of the itu
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also macam lawa gitu
it's very macam ethereal
I cannot remember but it was the director of pengabdi setan
but I I want to watch pengabdi setan ah where to watch ah
because I I took the scriptwriting punya course apa
you make the film I write the script dah settle ah
like next year because tu apa tu
like my monitor punya resolution terlalu tinggi for the for the card
so macam I need a stronger card
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm murah punya maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know rehan that time buy on sale thirty seven murah
that's why it's so macam itu
sebab I don't like it ah because all the mat reps semua macam tengok macam uh demon slayer demon slayer
boleh beli dari AliExpress pe
of the thing because it's actually dia macam
macam with real respect for people punya feelings and not just some
random rom com yang dorang macam sebarang rojak letak kat dalam ni semua abeh mix mix mix abeh
janji kelakar habis ah
but at the same time like you must also consider macam kat japan kan
yang the source material dorang punya manga ke
dia punya light novel ke visual novel ke pe
has to be actually very popular dalam its own format
or sampah habis
different ke
so sahaja jer ah dia ambil
oh dia muda eh
husband dia singaporean pe
oh abeh dia just dapat kerja kat sini ah
maybe dia punya dia tak kasi basis book tak suka ah
wait dia tinggal kat mana
as in as in in indonesia dia tinggal kat mana
boleh eh
try uh nanti
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time eh kita kita cari korean punya movie
wait so so far your your korean punya tu sampai tahap apa
as in like dia punya apa tu
boleh understand adult punya language ke
macam hyperinflation
came first sebelum writing
dia punya shine through lawa tak
oh macam too good to be true gitu ya
ah ya I mean it's not lucky lah it should fit because it's all out punya key cap apa
alamak minta tolong apa
alamak tutup eh tapi today today saturday kan normally weekend sabtu ahad buka apa okay mm
doesn't matter where tapi nak kena dekat ke nak delivery ke nak apa
mm I think for me kalau recommendation I recommend just nearby kalau since you're going out already might as well pergi to err minang minang
I forgot the name ah minang house I think minang or minang house I know of a few so that one yang popular dia dekat dengan masjid sultan just in front so kalau you masuk from the
eh from the back I think boleh tapi from the side lah the side gate you just park there then
masuk maybe like lima minute jalan lima minute
then mesti nampak mm mm
selalu long queue lah every time tapi the only thing is you have to go with your parents early lah kalau tidak lunch time selalu wah the queue is like gila like oh my god like you can see
I don't know dua puluh orang dalam queue
tak boleh tak boleh buat reservation ah just queue I mean I don't see them taking reservation lah because dia punya tempat macam macam biasa macam kedai kopi tapi dia macam atas punya kedai kopi sikit ah cause boleh ada two storey so and it's like a shophouse so definitely I don't think they take reservations but
ya lor just walk in lor but I mean kalau you want just go maybe pukul sebelas
mm ya sebelas setengah sebelas setengah for lunch tapi because dinner normally err I think tutup
um ya so I think kalau nasi padang kalau nak makan fresh you makan lunch lah jangan pergi dinner dinner
susah lah kalau nasi kalau you know lauk kalau basi sakit perut seh
tapi tu apa tu err singaporean yang buka apa
ke indonesian
orh okay interesting I mean cause from what I know kalau nasi padang normally lah selalu lunch kalau dinner I don't know I mean the the other one that I know is at paragon tapi that one is in a mall lah
and be be prepared to pay like I don't know I don't know I on average lah macam empat puluh lebih lima puluh lebih because dalam paragon you know lah it's an atas mall so tambuah mas
tu also very popular because last time you know lah tourist selalu pergi and then
err I think it's at basement basement one or basement one or two lah hmm so you can expect the place to be a bit more atas lah
ya lah you know lah situ beli gucci lah lah prada lah ya lah kalau ada duit lah kalau tak ada duit then different story lah tengok-tengok jer boleh lah kan tengok tak ada tak tak ada duit apa tak minta duit eh
mm try lah I think that one is one of the popular ones but I think makan situ lagi sedap
eh lepas ni nak pergi mana
pergi shopping ke
go earlier lah nowadays because aiya you know lah sekarang because of the pandemic alamak macam macam like nak masuk mall jer nak check in check out then like ambil temperature lah abeh mall lain habis store lain
abeh every store you go you have to take your temperature my god it's like I mean after awhile I don't know for you and your parents but I like for me when I go with my mum it's like penat seh just masuk keluar masuk keluar
like non stop and then kalau tak kalau tak ambil temperature tak ambil tak masuk dekat safe entry thing tak boleh masuk
even if you want to go for like five minutes also tak boleh
I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops tak okay I'm like really like come on lah like give chance a bit lah like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously lah that is true tapi macam kelakar because at the beginning bila this started semua orang macam alamak kanchiong kanchiong spider you know macam alamak
okay how ah macam how to check in how know contact tracing lah this and that and then after that after awhile
I think right the best kalau ada duit beli online sudah
uh uh betul memang memang my mum also experience that before dia beli apa lah kelakar it's not just baju eh it's like barang-barang rumah sekali after that dia punya colour lain and then dia punya size pun lain
ada boleh lah ada like macam all those order macam order from china all that how to how to return back seh
no gambar cantik selalu gambar cantik makanan pun sama every time kalau order grab dia punya gambar alamak macam photoshopnya wah it's really like damn atas the photo
and then sekali datang like that time okay it's funny that time eh I'm sure you mesti you ada story pasal like failed grab delivery punya apa tu
punya orders my god my my time bila I mean my experience so far is like oh my god
like it's really crazy like okay example leh that time I beli ayam penyet and then you know what happen nasi tak datang boleh gitu order ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet tau tapi nasi
tak ada and then bila bila complain dengan dia orang firstly dia orang tak angkat phone abeh dah dah gitu and then nak tanya lah
mana mana nasi kan nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang order nasi lemak tak ada nasi order nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar
and then dah lapar and then after that dia orang boleh cakap oh I think the nasi dia orang either dia orang lupa atau driver makan huh tak I don't know nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa
you imagine if it's you kalau if it's your if you are in my shoes tak marah
nak nak tunggukan nasi and then takkan so the the kelakar part is the kelakar part of the story is what know
bila I call them to go and say that the nasi tak ada and then dia cakap so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say ah tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke and then
kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa tau dia cakap ma'am because right the restaurant err a lot of order ah ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait ah maybe one or two hours untuk satu nasi I'm like ah
tak payah lah in the end my mum masak nasi sendiri ah so thanks lah so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
satu jam eh eh kalau I mesti dah
dah membara you know like dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk
abeh still nak tunggu satu jam eh tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli mcdonald's sudah
ya lah masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak clean up tu nak bersihkan eh tak payah lah
ah wah mesti crowded gila ah
abeh huh cancel
eh eh jahatnya sedih
so I think also susah lah macam the restaurant nak blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end siapa yang suffer seh
dia punya gaji bukannya berapa seh kesian mm mm
tu lah I mean I selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal lah dengan motor lah dengan kereta lah and then
selalu macam you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun alamak macam susah you know macam kesian ah macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya
apa tu dia orang punya job lah like tapi tak tahu eh macam let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer lah
eh eh baiknya lah eh eh siapa seh tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu as in tip in cash or huh oh my god
mm mm betul
mm betul
mm mm betul
tu lah lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua still ada comment lah singaporeans standard lah kalau tak complain bukan singaporean apa
susah lah nak order macam like that time baru my friend order apa eh I think dia order
susah kalau I mean that time my friend pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang eh that time my friend order during bulan puasa ah during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk lah because dia orang ada macam
apa macam err open house eh bukan open house macam
err family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be lah you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is dia hantar banyak rumah so they order macam maybe like four packet like empat packet satu rumah
so altogether maybe about empat puluh packet they just put you know lah
malay family banyak kan
so dia baik hati lah because like one of the days dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the makanan basi ah dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi and then macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan
so dia punya order datang pukul empat
and then dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas and then after that makanan dia basi so satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih
ah abeh yang kelakar punya yang the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that err food stall dia boleh cakap apa tau oh err sorry ah to customer who got the food that is basi
ah ah so also kelakar lah because okay lah kalau macam restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you macam a bit of refund or what lah but because they are
correct and then nasi I mean okay nasi padang eh maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month eh plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus tau then imagine half of the nasi basi macam mana gitu
tak ada tak ada tak ada refund tak ada dia boleh cakap oh we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya lah tu lah kesian and then it's like macam
pergi mana cycling kat mana seh
boleh juga lah eh tapi esok sunday seh confirm banyak orang
oh masih
ah ah sama mountain bike ah sama tak tak tak tukar
mm I think makan apa err cinema tempat wayang kan masih tutup kan oh dah buka eh tapi dia punya gambar semua macam gambar dulu-dulu jer siapa seh nak tengok
mm mm I think sekarang that day I think what lima puluh or something like that
boleh lah sounds like a plan bro
eh tapi kat changi banyakkan dia punya tempat yang nasi lemak macam semua semua best nasi lemak so semua semua kalau tanya mana satu yang bagus dia cakap ah semua semua famous tak tahu I think I don't know like five
six five or six stalls there right that jual nasi lemak or is it is it more than that I can't remember dah lama seh tak pergi makan changi tapi as usual kalau nak tanya orang
mana best nasi lemak semua best ah depends ah yang mana depends on apa like you suka tapi more or less sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah kan apa apa yang beza dia
kan unless it's sama apa kalau nasi lemak I mean okay lah the good thing is that dia punya price there is like macam dua I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya
uh uh dia punya nasi punya banyak I always I always ingat dia punya ada dia punya stall kasih lauk banyak abeh ada nasi macam macam walao like mountain like that know makan tak habis
mm ya lah standard kalau makcik kalau kasi wah very generous then kalau senyum-senyum sikit nanti mesti dapat lebih
okay boleh mm
okay lah boleh lah hopefully tak hujan seh sekarang kalau weather you know lah macam unpredictable that day punya lah panas I think I check the temperature you know what's the temperature thirty four degrees seh thirty four degrees tapi
kalau you tengok iphone punya app kan dia punya degrees ada macam ada macam feels like ah macam macam actually
feels like is forty two eh wah forty forty two dah macam dekat dubai seh
ah ah tu lah it's like and then kelakar kan because nowadays bila panas very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time dekat dekat singapore I think kat mana entah changi ke pasir ris ke bedok the rain sampai flooding sampai banjir and then the banjir is so bad that
at the bus stop dia punya orang is standing on the seat eh
and the air naik all the way tau
macam bukan kat singapore seh
a'ah betul a'ah betul betul
ya and then I saw seh banyak orang macam video
and apa tu banyak orang video of the incident that happen then like one of them is so funny because kan at that point of time you it's like I think I don't know lah since circuit breaker or something like that
or phase one or something then the dia punya it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus leh and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers habis lah
basah kuyup seh habis ah
kesian uh uh tu lah that's why it's like really not like singapore seh
and then means weather forecast semua salah lah
tu lah like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain dia cakap actually suppose hujan sampai tuesday ah next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today punya lah panas mana tak dengue kat singapore
weird leh no but talking about dengue oh my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day pasal the dengue case and then one of my colleague boleh kena dengue seh uh uh and the kelakar part dia mat salleh
dia dia asyik I think dia asyik keluar petang ah pergi jogging ke apa entah lah tak ingat lah apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap oh I I was out sick for one week so I said lah how are you so I thought maybe um like he fever ke cause you know lah nowadays kalau sakit it's like either you kena COVID nineteen or you kena
dengue and then the funny part is dia cakap dia kena dengue
uh uh confirm and then dia dah takut because they dia ingatkan that kena masuk hospital lah so actually tak payah because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
I I I don't know how he got it I think dia cakap that maybe because dia selalu keluar petang ah dia keluar petang to go jogging around dia punya area and dia standard lah dia tinggal dia tinggal kat robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area ah then after that
err don't know how he balik and then dia macam dia pening lah abeh dia batuk-batuk lah and then dia macam
dia rasa macam something is wrong lah so dia cakap actually dia pergi doctor first time then doctor say oh maybe you're just tired because dia sekarang kan everybody work from home ah then after that dia ingatkan
okay lah maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end dia pergi to another doctor the doctor cakap dengue then dia dah panic lah
so dia macam eh macam mana ni macam mana seh so dia dia takut that dia kena hospitalize lah because kalau hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
p[a'ah tu lah and then nowadays you know lah kalau ambil is not like those days lah ah like dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi I mean ambil boleh lah one two days stay at home sekarang is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss semua tahu habis seh
is it tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak
abeh macam mana seh dia orang nak check macam I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay lah I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like err kat apa tu at the west side I think yishun or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day ada fogging ah
and then fogging you know lah the smell oh my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in yishun and woodlands they say every other day ada fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell macam nak muntah seh and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
my mum even funnier bila dia dengar pasal these dengue cases and then like because that day I read it was ten thousand so then when I was talking to my ang moh colleague the the guy then his then err he said he doesn't know lah that because they ang moh apa he from sweden ah dia tak dia tak dia tak baca local news sangat lah baca pasal COVID nineteen COVID nineteen
and the pandemic and everything that's happening in the world lah then but then he never read about the dengue then he said oh I didn't know that dengue was a very big thing so I said ya it's actually ten thousand cases sekali I read on the day itself is already more than twenty two thousand cases eh it's crazy my god
tapi macam mana seh
macam mana nak tengok kalau even if your eyesight is like perfect eyesight macam mana nak tengok
by the time they want to gigit you they just gigit
so leceh lah sekarang kalau kalau sakit then susah tau nak kena pergi doctor lah nak kena self self isolate lah then macam-macam ah like macam-macam test seh nak kena
nak kena ambil is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know lah is hard to predict right ya so kalau dah
I don't know lah just keep healthy lah ah just keep on exercising makan betul-betul jangan makan all the
he just drink water a lot everyday because dia tak ada medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary ah
macam-macam lah nowadays
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day mesti ada something you know and it's only what august oh my god
ya lah ya lah betul susah lah
ya lor that's why how seh they check everyday like that tak penat ke macam
mm mm ya lah that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see lah the weather like panas lah hujan lah then all the air bertakung like that then mana tak dengue seh ya then there's nobody like
because my house area ada banyak new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks macam seram seh like so quiet mm so I guess lah because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
more and more ya mm mm betul lah correct
ah ah betul lah kesian eh
mm mm tu lah makan maggi jer lah hari-hari they are also heroes ah mm mm
no lah work from home lah because office tak buka then how
mm mm kat raffles leh oh my god
sama ah
mm mm tu lah
correct and then kalau you know lah kalau lunch time situ not only crowded like raffles and area I mean most times you are like spending so much on your lunch like you know you know lunch you know the lunches are like what
ten to fifteen dollars on average and then and that's like every other day kalau makan luar jer dah mahal imagine like five times a day five times a week you have to do that walao like it's a lot of money you know
correct like all the small small things ah like I think you spend less lah when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy nak pergi shopping nak beli apa seh
electricity bill lah bill air bill api
mm mm betul
mm ya a lot of a lot of emphasis is on work life balance nowadays ah I mean you tengok ah kalau
whatever lah like macam you are
kelakar right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees eh completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal lah you know what I mean
kalau tidak susah macam mana seh macam like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
every every singaporean loves you know mm mm like that day apa tu baru national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend
tu lah
mm mm betul nak fourteen fourteen days leceh lah nak pakai mask lah pakai ni lah and then I don't know like the amount of money that you're spending is not worth it lah
virtual workout virtual makeup I think that day I baru nampak virtual makeup session then like
like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day baru I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
mm mm betul betul lah netflix eh netflix hari-hari
ya lah tapi the amount of things on netflix you can watch is
homerun even like malay shows I think what bunga tanjung or something like that that they have so it's quite interesting and it's like they have diverse range lah like malay english they even have like tamil shows and all that it's quite interesting like I mean I guess
I think dah buka lah but like I mean you have to take precaution right
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say lah just go out for awhile then balik cepat-cepat you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks seh oh my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that oh the fireworks you have to do at padang because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year oh my god so many different places kat tampines ada kat jurong I think is it
once every four years right mm mm millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the duit
mm ya ya lah betul lah
boleh nyanyi mm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you rasa like macam-macam lah you rasa marah lah you rasa sedih lah you rasa ni lah macam-macam
macam-macam perasaan tapi at the end of the day mesti positive lah you know kalau tak positive susah seh I mean hari-hari takkan I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive lah of course some days kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke just feel all your emotions and then
tak penat ke eh mm mm mm mm
betul no lah and also you complain
mm mm betul mm mm
ah ni kalau ni singaporean kalau tak complain bukan singaporean kan
mm mm betul I mean there's good and bad lah I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know macam
mm betul
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask lah right I mean ya I mean singapore nak semua orang kena pakai mask
tak payah pakai mask
so like macam suka-suka jer then I like
eh boleh ah I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory lah for all but then I guess
jaga diri baik-baik lah you know kalau pakai nak pakai up to you lah you know
semua nak jadi famous ah semua tak ada kerja nak jadi famous ah so okay lah so dia orang tak nak pakai mask then like I guess
tu lah
bukannya mahal ke the mask ada I think what less than one dollar you can get already
uh tu lah
nak buat apa five year aku tak tahu aku cakap macam oh definitely I want to excel in my career meaning that I wanna be moving up the ladder not just in terms of management role lah but you know like also like macam okay if this is something that I have never done before so that to me is also a progression right or if let's say
I was like apa seh nak cakap
I aspire to inspire kau nampak kau nampak
yes so ah I had like three interviews and then um so this is what for it's like so as in I got three interviews err no was it three I think I I had three interviews and two follow up post yes yes yes from the same company so um I felt that macam this company is kan and and
I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know err where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like macam like siala I want go interview but I scared sia yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where macam um aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain then bila aku cari kerja lain I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that macam
very much so yes okay lah no look my training ground is actually quite far tapi aku aku fikir panjang kan dia cakap five year plan kan aku fikir five plan dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun okay
yes my new colleague tell me okay okay we will see you become like reach this position in five years I just no lah no lah no lah satu tahun then coming july dua tahun
cepat juga kan I feel like macam wah all the job demands macam I'm like just taking in everything so it's good that you when this new colleague masuk kan beberapa macam
berlega sikit lah hati aku tak payah banyak sangat buat macam everything is on me you know and some more yes but when he ask me like oh like you want to become a we have a senior position at my workplace in the next few years I'm not sure you know having the having my own local brand
but I really wanted that tengah estate house get the the sales of balance flats if I get it the house will be ready in may twenty twenty two twenty twenty three because it was the first few launch yes the one that they released in november as in recently the house will only be ready in twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five jauh seh
because my fiance dia tak ada passion nak pergi sangat to get a house planning or let's say we'll see how
not not like what's in it for you but more of macam
uh role in terms of career wise I'm like in redeem kan so I used to be in right and then now I'm in like mass production retail so people it's funny macam we see that aspect of people who like I don't want to buy ah you know I want to save money ah now now tough time lah cannot spend lah
and and we haven't had a lot of okay lately there have been a few chinese tourists tourists bukan bukan local aku takut
boleh bah certain certain countries can come in singapore already what
so macam like a the same thing lah okay yes I I hear the same thing you know like now cannot lah no cannot spend lah now err must save money you know market very bad financial very bad blah blah blah blah blah but your bill can go up to like what five six hundred dollars

but previously aku buat gitu juga I like you know the
ya then after that the the barefoot kaki ayam girl said lain kali nak turun slope is either like you control or you just squat so is like heavier so is like slower oh ya why I didn't think of it
dekat ring eh macam dekat ice rink gitu back there
she wanted to bring then but but I didn't ask lah then err the husband or something tell us she wanted to bring the roller it happen to just come out lah the speed roller skate then like dia kata lupa nak bawa then they were matching you know the husband was wearing hot pink short
and then baju hitam
so it's like terbalik
ya dorang in theme sendiri
but when she speaks is a you know eh baby B passkan air B
then she tell me like penat ya here here here here here I go drink I go drink like the voice like people was like dah penat eh air air air you know
uh apa tu
takde eh
naik basikal I see the cuaca today like hot only
I need to wear face masks right now sekarang dengan COVID nineteen ni semua
oh the kain yang macam instructor when they do instructors when they do camp they wear that buff mask right that kind that oh ya okay okay
tadi that time you told me before lah apa you cakap you you cycling abeh ada benda go into your mouth is it
susah nak nak bernafas lah ni
lalat as in ah as in lalat as in housefly
but a lalat the black flying buzzing thing
you swallowed you went to swallow ah the housefly sedap tak
so you were cakap orang cakap apa ni perfectly fine ah after you accidentally swallowed a housefly
the oh ya true true ada tempat yang
err ya I mean ada tempat
entah mana lah suka they they love to makan all these maggots spiders all these weird weird apa binatang ni semua
no no I I don't I don't want to eat all these any weird animals eh you said you you ride bicycle eh datang sini
and you tengah ambil your motorbike licence right are you oh yes
kat mana where you take where you taking ah
and kalau you naik motorbike if I'm not wrong lah if I'm not wrong err if you work under foodpanda dia punya gaji lebih kan sepuluh dollar per hour I think
tapi I think I got some friends who are under
who are under foodpanda dia orang I ada tanya lah I ask them eh how much gaji bagus tak if you work with foodpanda as part time and stuff and they say it it's not bad lah actually like I think they have the for foodpanda if I'm not wrong they have the
hourly rate and then if within that one hour you boleh hantar banyak makanan they call it docket if I'm not wrong
so if you can hantar more food means you earn more dockets and there's ada macam bonus lah kasih dia orang happy sikit kasih the riders happy sikit
macam competing lah
oh okay tapi if I'm not around kan ah kadang-kadang if the customer happy you bawa
their their makanan cepat-cepat then they will boleh kasih you tip eh
tapi tengok lah tapi ada orang kasih ke tak
okay okay okay tapi ah what's the
what's the paling banyak ah orang kasih your tip
macam paling banyak tip one time they give you one big tip ada tak
one customer kasih give you ah ten dollar tip
wah very good ah but oh ya your bicycle I see I like so terkejut no I follow my friends semua nak beli basikal I thought lah I ingat one bicycle maybe
sixty dollars ke hundred dollars ke but
and we can you imagine you tengah hantar makanan orang tengah tunggu at the house waiting where is my food alamak then find out the the rider bicycle pancit or the wheel
ah pecah ke apa then like quite wasted lah if you buy a cheap very cheap kind of bicycle
oh ya lah dia punya drivers kalau nampak orang bicycle they will try to try to apa tu drive very near to the bicycle ya lah I mean I know that you all want to rush for more orders means more money but then sometimes terlupa that eh you guys are on the road
and there are buses ada apa tu lorry ada motorcycles semua so next time just be more careful lah tengok lah before you pusing you tengok apa apa tu blind spot check back check back eh check back whether there any vehicles around you ah
okay okay then you tadi morning you told me you were taking your motorbike practical also right kat where again kat mana the ubi ubi eunos there right is it
ah so you macam tahu lah apa dia punya dangers and stuff
so next time when you dah dapat license your motorbike licence ke car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see eh got one cyclist coming or eh got one cyclists behind me you know lah to be more careful
eh wait wait that means you on which practical five eh lima
ah okay okay okay before oh ya prac five yang you have to do everything in the circuit then kalau pass prac six then only can go out at the road
uh okay tapi one thing about ubi eh cause I took my license there at ubi also
that dulu lah dulu lah when I when I took my license apa tu ubi ah very crowded so you just be very careful lah kalau especially when you first time keluar naik road
because I know some of my kawan they took the license motorbike licence kat
the one yang kat the one yang kat mana woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there sunyi ah quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded macam kat ubi so I think for them was macam lagi senang to pass the test lah test
you naik basikal to ubi
oh you tak ambil public transport
orh okay okay okay then for you kalau dari hougang want to cycle to woodlands itu dah penat bro
by the time you want to start your lesson at woodlands you already penat you cannot really ride the motorbike motorbike ride you I think I don't know whether motorbike would go then later you kena scolding from all instructors
tapi I think one practical how much is it now
dua puluh eh dua puluh lebih
oh yes yes as you I think as you naik naik uh as you progress the cost of course lah dah lagi more mahal
kalau you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's lagi more mahal lah as you go along this
but when do you think you will get your license though boleh beli motorbike boleh naik motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
lagi that day yang kat ah news north west line the major ah blackout alamak itu dia orang during bila peak period and then the red line the green line dengan dia punya yellow line sekali breakdown
ya but ah apa tu when you when you dah pass eh which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero itu kan the tuning training centre punya motorbike eh tak
oh you can get cause I know my friends yang sekarang tengah pakai they say it's err fuel efficient dapat jimat duit sikit
atau kalau you banyak duit sangat kan you boleh beli those err more expensive motorbike yang macam triumph
triumph or ah the one I paling suka when I see people riding on the motorbike uh royal enfield
oh but you don't want to buy a first hand punya motorbike eh
wah and then kalau you tak ada here for six months then who going to use your bike cause you need to always someone needs to start start your motorbike right you cannot leave it err sleeping for too long period
but I mean the transport transports sekarang tak boleh reliable sangat lah sekarang
tapi I would say that the transport has he has been getting better lah dulu I think a few years back three or four years back ada this one period of time macam every week confirm plus chop ada breakdown every week confirm ada
breakdown lah ada yang
the travelling time was too long ada jer problem kadang-kadang but I would say now is much better lah they're doing a much better job but but having said that masih boleh improve that they can still improve so that's my take
the best surprise eh yang I paling dapat uh
ini many years ago lah eh many many years ago when a for my twenty first birthday selamat hari jadi eh my twenty first birthday ah my kawan-kawan kaki bola my soccer mates want to throw me a birthday
ya so I remember that time masih masih bulan ramadan that time when we were still fasting and then my birthday fell within that month lah
then err they chose this place namanya is called mark's place the one at eunos they wanted to belanja me dinner then okay I was like okay sure ah then I went down
they book the table for seven so senang lah bila time buka we all boleh makan together right
so I came down I was so excited lah kirakan eh I went there at about pukul berapa eh I went six thirty so I sat there and I was the first to come I was the first to arrive so okay I duduk I duduk there at the table
then I duduk I tunggu tunggu tunggu for my friends nobody turn up tak ada orang datang
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know ada because the place where I tengah duduk uh is facing the road
so I saw this one kereta just drive past tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak jer this kereta then I noticed dia punya driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
oh by the way kita tak makan kat sini I tengok them they tengok me and then I still remember other tables
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like terkejut sikit lah eh asal tiba-tiba want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then err so they blindfolded me so when I masuk the kereta I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me diam-diam and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location lah location yang I sendiri tak tahu so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the dia punya pintu
I can hear the pintu buka but when the pintu buka also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car dah park and then my kawan-kawan say okay now you can uh get off the car so of course ada orang pimpin my tangan cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into longkang or something
ah okay then I just ikut I just pimpin my friend tangan they brought me to a unknown location ah next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
kita kat marina barrage
ya oh if I remember correctly tak salah there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they letak uh picnic mat they letak uh fairy lights and they prepared some makanan like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were err tengah puasa time tengah puasa I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks ada bawa uh game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice lah like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
yang paling best uh lepas kita dah makan dah sing song uh perut dah kenyang and then err one of them pass me a birthday present
and nasib is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a kasut nike like this specific kasut yang
was quite mahal lah actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this kasut that I think was about dua ratus lebih this pair of nike shoes
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will tanya the person first like oh apa yang you nak you want a teddy bear ke you want
you want if motorbike cannot lah I not that kaya so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack boleh lah if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time bila aku dalam kereta macam eh
takkan they want to kidnap me takkan they want to hantar me to johor bahru or put me in a abandoned house or something ada lah there was a period of time I was like asal kereta ni macam suddenly so quiet eh like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my apa ke tu ah kawan-kawan kaki bola so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents eh
because sometimes I don't want to belikan orang tu a present that they might not want or atau present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like oh okay what do you want for your birthday lah or it's either I buy for them uh
vouchers like it can be macam adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers ah pergilah kau apa kau nak beli
I know kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal can buy err gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually lah girls I think lagi senang to to buy presents for compared to a guy
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I tak suka kalau macam
uh big uh birthday bash macam ada orang kan they especially kalau
twenty one birthday they will have their macam nak glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite macam kawan dia nenek dia cousin dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang like I tak suka that kind of stuff lah
kawan-kawan rapat lah so is good thing that they didn't throw a big uh big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like kalau anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
and also kalau macam banyak sangat orang especially kalau invite banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang you tak kenal atau orang yang that you barely talk to so you macam tak nak awkward lah then kalau banyak sangat orang also later you have to
you have to split your time with err different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you kena go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having macam a very good time and macam shiok sendiri
and I so I feel like kalau like you want to have a this macam grand gestures right you need to kena fikir where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until macam sakit kepala lah you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance kalau you want to do like
tempat mahal-mahal macam hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you kena book
ah makanan I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue nak kena fikir pasal uh makanan
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to fikir oh what entertainment do you want I mean kalau you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay lah then you can like lepak don't have to
if you gonna dapat orang birthday planner or something like that then you kena bayar this birthday planner pakai duit lagi
oh ya I mean like quite true eh tadi you cakap pasal if your birthday on macam twenty fifth december ke or macam your birthday is on err
thirty first december where's the peak period macam banyak orang confirm nak nak book err tempat macam want to book the hotels dekat dekat dengan the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder lah I would say or even if your birthday falls uh during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and susah to dapat all this uh bookings and stuff
and also kalau macam some people macam tak nak celebrate dia punya birthday kat singapore nak pergi overseas ke apa nak pergi batam
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu plane tickets semua tapi sekarang bila time macam gini
nobody saw it coming macam time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more gerek lah if you can celebrate your birthday in bali or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more gerek sia
like I think for me kalau if I can choose eh where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that tempat banyak sheeps ah new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a tempat for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside boleh apa tu feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
err kambing so at least when you go places like new zealand especially dia punya countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of uh
natural activities like apa tu yang kat river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
uh nice nice mountains and of course dia punya cuaca also lain lain from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times dapat juga some snow you pernah pergi new zealand eh
tapi kalau uh japan japan nak cari
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food punya lah susah and
it was not readily available so you have to do your macam homework lah before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to makan halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food boleh dapat at food court you can dapat your halal food at a hawker centres which are all semua dekat dekat boleh jalan so there the
their are halal food ah is different different locations and you have to go and find it in orang jepun they don't really speak english so kalau nak berbual you probably have to use ah the app google translate to help you out
oh the place I went mana eh I went to their
uh tokyo so tokyo was tokyo honestly dia macam singapore lah macam banyak sangat orang it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of jepun that I would like to visit err I will go further up north
err pergi hokkaido I think hokkaido also lagi tempat dia will be more sejuk and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to pernah pergi tak hokkaido
so I think kalau if you don't want to go jepun another place that I pernah pergi also err south korea like at least south korea you know lah people there dia punya complexion semua cantik-cantik
semua the people there their are complexion all putih-putih and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of err herbal food dia punya makanan is very different from singapore like our singapore diet kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai err makanan yang very oily but there in korea their food
and they always like to eat their favorite kimchi so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more kacak and cantik lah actually
oh ya because their their location have err what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located dekat equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure uh countries yang ada four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to ah further up north
places macam err sweden ke or you go to norway or finland if you tengok their completion putih macam letak bedak kind of putih
and err one thing kalau want to talk about uh going on vacation and stuff I think one err important aspect about going to vacation is to naik kapal terbang like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this kapal terbang just to duduk inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
in a roller coaster when the plane dah nak takeoff atau the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID err introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the tempat economy
so maybe I will decide nak tengok nak pergi ke tak but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing lah that you can get to travelling during this
err COVID situation will you go for this err parked err makan
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong lah is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly kalau nak fikir pasal six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation kat sentosa ke or I can use that money for
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december dah nak dekat
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher lah to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since orang kat luar cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
okay so err tadi kan kita cakap pasal three wish tadi kita cakap pasal the three wishes kan for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
your youtube punya channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
because macam I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights lah but if you don't have those kind macam those text yang dekat tepi tu say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video dia orang tak on the audio what kau kalau macam the person switch off the audio and you just you playing macam tak ada some err text visuals to compliment you punya video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft jer
oh okay I faham so that means dia punya the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel kan it's like macam highlights for that particular night punya game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses lah that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve lah
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of macam those err it gives me that kind of impression macam when I watch people play game kan it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video macam it's just it's similar just like the makan punya channel or makan punya video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious mm ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience boleh visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of err are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the um your spidey spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is apa tu the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's haram because it's very very very ketat unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my aurat so I I mean macam if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement ah tapi yang the one you beli tu berapa ah
black cat apa cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather kan cat woman punya
cat woman punya okay ah ada cat woman punya I nak ah
oh ya you dah telefon your mother to come tomorrow
no wah you tahu my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days eh oh my god I was like
how did everyone accumulate two digit punya leave balance seh
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time kalau tak already I tell you by august begitu kan I would already have exhausted all my leave already for safwan appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember saffi hospitalise
ya I guess that's the only one ah oh ya tadi kita cakap pasal what can you mentioned the IKEA punya cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
whether right we should just err err fix the cabinet dekat err the master bedroom side because um for this mean toilet I nak ada other some improvements in err in terms like macam there's that rail handrail so that down the road kan kita tak payah nak renovate
ya because adding the macam cabinet there kan it might like macam block orang punya as in it might block lah whoever who
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the jamban
then oh right that was not your right the one that err rumah dia is actually just opposite B P there right the resale kan actually no wonder they need to err hack the toilet because she um megan got tell me before the dia punya rumah tu macam quite rundown and then if they don't fix it kan macam is cannot as in there will be leak and everything lah
huh ya ke that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
oh then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything ya ke izzad punya rumah dekat mana
oh they take over they are not err apa tu getting a new house ah because I know the dia orang punya cousin wardah and umar kan nearby kan that's why they don't intend to shift ah
so bila ija bersalin
oh man tapi they they always give a one week one week
tak baik seh cakap macam tu
I think I think dia pun worried seh
eh tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan
orh what tanya jer ah what the heck
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time ah the pregnancy ah I really want to have that element of surprise lah it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will tak boleh tak boleh like not prepare
it cannot that and then I know for me kan I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't macam if I'm not wrong planning need or what right macam it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it what cause like my kid keluar I need to macam make sure oh dia punya the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours lah it's just that I don't know ah macam
macam ah very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green kan actually the bottle yang I belikan tu all green kan because ah safwan punya milk pun green dia punya apparel pun green ingat tak and then dia punya yang all the friends yang kita beli ni semua
colour hitam so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination macam those kind of paddle pop punya colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
yang dia rainbow tau yang paddle pop punya ice cream tu tau
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue kan kan it goes well with this kind of pink kan cantik kan
wah okay lah actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually kan I nak amend and fix the dapur punya counter top I really cannot stand the counter top lah ya macam so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the macam the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because macam kita punya rumah is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind tak masuk I did but the thing is when I wipe it kan there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya lah usually they will they have like some uh ventilation lah so that the tu so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing lah I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the apa tu pintu cabinet will pecah kan actually oh my god
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was err my friend called ah from uh ya just like uh like so it was quite interesting because uh they needed a picture of a day doctor err then err the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital tapi they need a doctor to be featured dia orang punya newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer lah so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel ni I took I took a picture and err portrait punya macam mode kan
but when I when I send across kan it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it macam why would you need like um a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like dia require exactly three hundred because kita punya my mobile phone kan when I check uh is like hundred eighty
so no choice nak kena pakai lah
ya lah but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two apa tu two style eh two apa tu file format one is the raw one is the uh so kalau macam dia orang nak edit kan they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the macam the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in dua punya format then I send to the to the printer err not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw kan actually raw image it has to be set from a camera kan
are you planning to change your phone oh wait you change already ah I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I suka dengan my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I tak nak pixel but that time kan tak ada ingat tak I ordered online
it's it's really huge ah serious I just find it too huge but macam when I hold it on my palm kan I will need to stretch I punya thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I ambil I ambil the ring and tampal you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card punya holder tu so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder
the kids see that one they don't like tak sedap seh I don't like it's just damn weird oh but I like the ninja chicken burger though
love it I don't know the sauce is called nambam sauce or something like that namban tak pernah dengar seh that sauce
is never never heard before I pernah dengar macam miso err miso err teriyaki is like some people ask me whether is teriyaki I feel like is a mix of teriyaki and something salty I don't know what its chicken is nice you tak you tak try ke that time
kenapa kepala you pening tak minum air eh
you should just do eh tadi mana air I eh
oh ya anyway tadi weather was ya okay tadi the seller stop dekat mana
habis macam mana but is ready is ready ah
I'm just thinking like whether this person dia ada jangkit or what sebab tu dia tak kasi you picit the door bell no but don't even allow you to knock usually I don't mind knocking initially I don't mind knocking but door bell cannot doorbell is too loud
on the floor tak ada bench orh okay lor
that's very considerate of you all the deliveries yang I dapat all hang at the handle ah then I was like how am I suppose to open the gate without dropping it so I I pick up with my hand and then I open the gate nonsense kan that's very considerate and very thoughtful
so dua the dua is dari mana punya section
no but dia nak kena tulis apa like you accumulate like which is like blind spot okay right
tapi yang paling kelakar yang I tak faham is I punya kereta I pass sekali I punya motor I fail it one time
take so long to cakap I punya figure of eight eh take so long to finish lah figure of eight must be eight seconds
ya lambat must be more than six seconds
did I tell you some uh an accident that I witness on the on a plank orang ni dia err it was rainy um but ah it was sad lah because after dia I witness dia punya accident I think it was it will stay in my mind that I couldn't forget and then I fell on the speed you know the the you have to speed up your speed then you have to brake at the line ya correct so what happened at the plank was I was right behind this person
I tak tahu apa or kaki dia stuck or what kan dia went up the plank dia dah nak dah nak like maybe err err five metres or like maybe one or two metres away from the last one and then jatuh off and then dia punya gigi hit the another side habis chip off the two teeth chip and it was not a nice cut oh it was like a like a diagonal line
oh my god you I tengokkan dia and it was a guy yo I mean okay ah I'm I'm not saying that oh err guys should be okay girl shouldn't lah but seriously it was not even a test it was raining a practice session oh my god habis dia gini-gini dia asyik pegang dia punya gigi tau instructor ada instructor no but
but rabak he just trip like that you know even the whole gigi patah tau the dua gigi patah better kan
oh boleh eh as long as you find your because I I know he didn't pick up the thing ah
oh I see I though you tampal from the
sial oh I can't forget seh I tu dia terus kan I bailed I cakap is okay I think the plank very slippery I go the other one dia betul-betul I try the apa tu emergency break tu I think I step on the the the err back punya brake kan too hard dia punya is so weird tau the back tire just swing forward you know it's so fast you know it's just like swing macam ini seh then I drop on my left knee
tak lah tak pakai
eh ada knee guard ke ah
because you say nanti you penat lah you nak I bawa motor lah apa lah
it's just water what is not like rosak what
kejap kejap vendor for what the backdrop
oh habis sekarang
the vendor bail pasal you all make too much changes or the vendor bail pasal you all tak bayar betul-betul
uh huh habis
but not because you guys made banyak changes ah
apa nama company dia
you mean but the company is not father in law dia punya company ah
I see tapi you cakap lah maybe your kerja kasi you freelance
eh vendor tak nak buat dekat you all
the yang this video ni siapa yang minta dia
so the person that I don't really like tu yang siapa tu so this saturday this sunday she will officially become that number one lah
because I know whereby sitting as a board member you can err you will officially can become macam you voluntarily kan volunteer with err providing your remarks and everything kan so called strategic directions when you are just talking and complicating things right
that's like senang kata ah senang kata because too many cooks spoil the broth
the broth tak lah spoil the soup lah wait what's the what's the idiom again apa too many cooks spoil the apa apa soup what serious I suka ah berbual macam
pasal kita no
tak pasal kita pun sejak kita kahwin kan we only kita selalu keluar and berbual macam ini only when kita the before with kids are really easy our window is just like tanya okay dah alright any long conversation do it with a phone kan we are a phone phone ah what conversation ya
kalau lah boleh screenshot jer the text messages and then err verbalise it screenshot the old messages and then we just verbalise the the text messages that would be fun
aiyo I'm just thinking uh okay I'm just thinking yang sunday ni this sunday ni eh kejap you sunday eh this saturday you kerja kan sunday ada apa wait there's something on happening on saturday orh eddie kahwin habis why why your reaction like that
no but how do I tell my father that he can't come wait kita punya wedding is for what time to what time ah two hours jer kat pasir ris lah kan okay two thirty to four can nanti kita kita naik teksi sana unless you want to go the downtown east ah lepas tu
nak pergi downtown east tak lepas tu I don't know ya but I think nak kena book ah you know nak kena book you know eh no no no tapi I rasa dia orang nak pergi wild wild wet tau boleh kita pergi wild wild wet lepas tu
alah confirm the kids nak main the tayoh
wah that means this weekend we are completely filled alah eh this month siapa punya birthday lagi you cakap
no I mean family lah family siapa eh punya birthday
asal you tak ambil gambar bila you dah dapat kan senang
mm mana ada dah berhenti apa it's not lah ya lah ya lah
sorry ah I pakai contact lens please
kena lah it's just um the thing is that I have too many that I don't know which one to do first ya lah but usually
oh aduh the the the person yang email I ni dah apa tu ya yang tadi I berbual dengan dia tu dia dah email eh oh dia also macam I sama ah a'ah
tak lah what we are small fry we are obviously right that's why a'ah seh kita semua dari tu eh get that experience
dah lah that's the thing is lah a meritocracy world I don't know lah I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is dekat my place ni kan I don't know why is like your capabilities tak cukup tau you punya papers is to macam is to support dia punya capabilities padahal it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that lah of course lah]basic is like have you pernah masak ke tak lah kan tapi doesn't mean tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you suruh I buat something
but to compensate me to compensate me you cakap oh err I know you do a good job tapi but sorry you not wearing uh err this err nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not kita tak boleh buat apa-apa this kind of things are like beyond our hands oh the
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense kan then bila I cakap macam tu will be like shit don't be too don't be too like err ini lah
see ah can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you tahu I kena buat about this digital plan about this um publicity booking schedule tau this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six eh I kasi one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I punya like okay for example maybe person A ada event then person B dia bukan event dia punya it's just a reminder ke some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to uh ah I have to give priority to the A person kan but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
err you have three people who want to put reminders and you tak ada event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing ah is it the thing is I can do it but it requires err half a day I cannot do this kind of planning kan macam like as a macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana I cannot I need to do macam I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so sekarang ni so I don't even want to start on it
that admin person coming second jan a'ah wah because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is itulah dia I don't know eh maybe err Q one end of Q one building up ya you dengar you dengar ni
actually I like something it's very funny tau this person yang masuk ni dia contact so many people around me except me tau to ask me about the job to ask about the job tau macam like
you could you just ask me what padahal kita but then I always like no orang yang dia tanya semua melayu like is like kau boleh tanya aku apa like ya shah aku dengar ada opening I mean macam we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the apa tu the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me apa seh dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah left a'ah macam dah transfer this one I tak tahu whether macam a'ah dia tanya sinar habis tu dia tanya meha except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and orang yang tak kerja dekat department tu I don't get it seh
then I just like macam so I am a bit err I'm a bit like macam weary tau kalau macam why why she needs to tanya orang lain besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I tak payah nak guide through macam that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running eh maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector kan dia ada we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very macam very very rank conscious apparently you you macam like err of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that macam sometimes bukan
orang rank conscious tau is because like you tak boleh ask err a associate to be doing err punya kerja ya it's not a right what ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank tau it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I tak faham when people say like oh err you shouldn't be err you um saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin ah you can see as like oh ya uh I shouldn't be err drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing lor I I find that it's very hard to juggle kat at this this place I'm working at
dia macam tak dia tak err macam kalau kat yang kerja lama I ni dia very is very obvious tau macam you macam tadi my yang call I dia cakap dengan I err kat at least dekat kerja lama kita kan err we know okay this for this job cuma but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them tau macam if thing goes wrong kan they are supposed to check
this and um they should be responsible um take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person kan ah baru punya orang and this person is from punya side lah so they are still learning the ropes to run that place ah side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for err diploma holders so dulu kan exactly so kan I bilang you there's ah err in that admission kan they have um
err the comms officer err assistant comms officer dengan abassir kan the one that I kan melayu they are very so now comms officer boleh pergi can take up the comms officer job
I know lah tapi macam ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go tapi dia tak pakai tu ah ni ah tak pakai tudung ya so I mean it still applies lah I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this err diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like ah that's why you say macam the cockroach keluar malam-malam kan I mean dia orang mati kan I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like dah lama sia I spray but if you notice this past few nights I tak spray tau maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but err what I heard is you run over the tray kan you got you mati
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line kan they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda punya powder tau then semua mati
bedak just normal bedak ah not bedak apa-apa
oh macam the the talcum powder eh
aku pernah pe keluar dengan perempuan dua kali
dinner dengan lunch ah
dinner dengan lunch aku bayar siol
pasal aku was like err apa nama dia
aku lupa dinner kita makan apa but
itu pasal apa eh
pasal aku aku nak tengok ah dia offer ke tidak then aku don't mind paying ah
cuma wah kau terus macam diri tepi jer eh
tak cakap apa-apa eh oh okay lor
I mean the fact that that macam
entah macam kena buat pakai ah
just want to have a good fun apa
like macam
macam that time ah macam aku pergi yang aku dekat zouk that time
then ada satu aku tak tahu siapa how the conversation was brought up ah but
berbual jer ah
apa nama dia the si ada satu perempuan tu ah macam
kita nampak satu perempuan then aku tak tahu how it was like ah ni dah lama gila but then satu orang cakap kan alamak but she's
she got boyfriend already ah bro aku pernah cakap ni tak
then after that satu budak ni ah lupa siapa nama dia terus datang he a part of that group ah cakap bro bro
if she's single lah you're fighting with everyone in the club bro dia kata gitu same thing ah
like which not written anywhere where kau ada cakap what I mean but it's an agreement between two people
but the same time if the two people have the agreement like macam kat france they have they have open relationship like I can sleep around whoever I want but at the end of the day I with you that kind of thing kan
like macam that time aku tak boleh tidur ah like
aku tengok Twitter and like romanticism kan
macam wah annoying gila sia
like macam kau expect benda-benda merepek tau everything
like macam benda-benda macam merepek oo sweet nya sweet nya terus macam apa yang kau sweet sangat siak
like macam
tak tahu ah handphone tengah record kalau tak aku dah buka Twitter aku dah tunjuk all the things that
oh that ada this girl ah there's this girl who ni mata air aku bilang there's this girl dia pakai tudung abeh dia nya boyfriend ada angkong semua
like macam tu so sweet macam she accepted him macam okay then after that like macam orang dia kata orang kat Twitter cakap gitu
terus macam err okay
ya then after that like macam
err err apa nama dia
then the boyfriend keep on kissing dia punya cheeks kind of thing then macam err then recently ah the boyfriend go and message her the way he message her saying that
um singaporean bi I don't need sex ah I can wait I can live without sex
terus aku nak kata lah if he's not fucking you he's fucking with someone else lah
then macam
apa yang macam merepek ah like that's the thing tau macam bila aku dapat tahu pasal romanticism kan
ikut perasaan tau perangai macam lembik perangai macam kental ikut just to like macam
like macam
ah I don't know how to explain ah nak kena tengok Twitter ah then after that aku can
really ah aku tunjuk aku can actually come to senses ah like tunjuk kau macam aku ambil
kita punya kedai handphone ada Twitter
banyak ah jap eh
eh takde eh
takde Twitter ah
camne eh nak explain
oo best ah kau kena tengok ah eileen the burton
eileen the burton ah eh for example ah the things yang dia highlight
yang benda yang dia highlight is like especially macam perempuan do this padahal kita pun buat laki pun buat like macam kita padahal kita buat not only with kita partners dengan members pun sama tau like macam kau tak tahu pe aku satu minggu penat macam for example dan it can be as simple as dan
this week aku penat gila ah kalau tak boleh turun boleh that kind of thing tau but we expect him to understand that eh kau dah bodoh pe
aku hari-hari kerja kau masih nak lepak sini ah that kind of thing ah it's like it's as easy as bro uh this week I quite full lah cannot come to the shop or not that kind of thing
ah this kind of thing ah so dia kata if it's a true love or if it's true friendship if you understand each other without saying which doesn't makes sense ah
abeh dia kata like macam we expect to do that we expect
macam for example dia cerita kan ah from a real life punya experiences dia balik
dia balik then after that err anak dia anak dia baby dia give anak dia some food anak dia tepis toddler ah nangis terus
kalau bini dia dah sepak ah I mean dia kata aku dah bingit gila ah dengan bini aku but he's my son lah but what I did was I try to understand him
like macam why did he why did he behave this way dia nak berak ke pampers dia ini ke dia gigi nak grow ke gini gini ah that's why then after that that was thinking ah dia kata dia macam why can't I behave
ah like macam senang cakap bila kalau
benda gini we always talk about girls kan macam eh what's wrong nothing that kind of thing like you can just tell me
but that's the thing ah like but at the end of the day also most guys also dorang tak tahu how to talk about
emotions macam suami kan
macam if they feel something diam
dengan dan pun diam unless kita brought it up really force him to talk about it then he will talk about it
a'ah tu pasal ah dorang tak ada orang ajar I mean like they
in a way lelaki kan
that's why dorang macam ah tak kesah pasal for example kalau laki laki ah siapa-siapa nak keluar kan
kita punya anak sedara ke siapa pe bapa pun macam nak pergi mana keluar take care eh jangan naughty naughty eh perempuan nak keluar kita kongkong that kind of thing lah like macam
laki we are just left to be everybody understand everybody have a way of thinking that guys are they can make it out there ah quite expected to know everything or like kau should know find for the answers
kita is still need a manual pe in some ways cuma that differentiate people lah like how they actually view things ah like some people they will macam
tak tahu continue to be lost lost lost lost lost lost sampai ke mampus anak bini semua masih lost ada kalau people have gone through a lot of shit kan then after that macam eh things cannot happen like this ah I want to find something better baru dorang improve
macam that time yang client aku hugo tu whoa
sama ah like macam abeh nampak dia tengah going undergoing stress tau a lot pasal bini dia kat portugal and dekat sini semua
abeh berbual dengan dia berbual berbual habis terus aku just open up ah aku just ah butoh lah aku cakap pasal bapa aku semua kan
aku cakap err apa nama dia
oh like macam that time bapa aku gaduh kat kerja tak ada orang defend dia that kind of thing then macam see everybody expects guys to like
macam siapa lelaki ada siapa nak berbual takde siapa-siapa pe
dan dah macam
okay ah we have no one macam you know then my friend ah kata ah aku tengah stress kawan aku kata
you know I'm not the up for the psychiatrist thing dia kata
laki ah laki you you don't know how to open up pe
a'ah it's seram
macam that time aku dengar satu talk tu ex-feminist kan aku dah cakap kan dia buat documentary dia feminist
and dia buat documentary ironically pasal err apa nama dia dia buat documentary about macam opposite of feminist ah kira men ah men fighting for men's right dia interview ni semua biasa tapi asal dia kerja
dia shut off that side of dia punya feminist side ah so kepala otak dia semua dia just judge whatever comes up to their mouth kan dia just judge
then bila
it comes to editing she have to listen what to everything so dia dia have to edit out filter all the content so dia realise never once
the guys were talking about ah apa nama dia

at the end of the day kalau kau dah enam puluh tahun kan life kau memang macam atuk nenek kita pun dorang cakap benda annoying pe that's one thing second thing kan this guy
new york kalau kau boleh hidup dengan mafia you can work with mafia to create trump tower when the workers who built that tower is mafia nya macam mafia control them but ni kau dah bagus mafia control everything new york
apa nama dia concrete bricks ni semua semua dia control
abeh kalau kau boleh survive that makna kau bukan bodoh sia
tu ah macam cakap world is being too soft ah
like macam that's the thing pasal aku macam aku nya aku selalu step macam jahat
jadi terlalu baik cause I have to acknowledge the devil the shadow kalau you err psychologist ah dia cakap kau nak kena face your demons kau kena acknowledge kau punya demons
so all these closet perverts ah be that all these closet perverts ah dia macam
um macam macam kau semua kita cakap pe kita open kita gini gini gini punya orang kita tak bedek kita tak macam
tak ah aku baik baik baik padahal musibat
ni kalau kau bersih pun maknanya kau hidup macam kermit ah hermit
pasal it's not human pasal apa-apa yang ada dekat kita itu semua part of feelings
pada aku is wrong to apa
feel a certain way but it only jadi wrong when you act upon it
kalau kau act upon it means kau dah conclude the whole
macam salah a'ah macam siapa nama dia
ah dalam islam umar
umar paling fierce placebo
no matter is considered allah
umar umar bila orang kata rasulullah meninggal kan
dia kata pe satu kali korang cakap kat aku rasulullah meninggal aku pancung korangnya kepala
abeh terus err apa nama dia
it's the other aku pernah dengar this talk orang ni cakap ustaz dia aku ni pemarah gini gini macam
bermakna it's not wrong we have to chill lah paling sekarang siapa next ah apa err the third khalifah a khalifah is someone paling garang sekali pe
macam you got to chill lah it's what you do you do
tu aku tak suka orang cakap ee kau ni
err cepat marah seh cepat marah I mean like pada aku cepat marah is a bit people who are very attune with their emotions
macam people want entah lah orang just
sebab tu lain orang lain pe
macam aku dengan mata air aku selalu macam aku cakap raised punya voice kan I'm not angry I'm just I mean I mean I'm I'm not angry at you I'm just I'm trying to acknowledge my feelings but when I raise my voice macam kadang aku tak marah dia it's just macam kita berbual pasal something ah we get hype up macam I'm not angry at you I'm just ah accepting the fact that I am angry about this
at least aku tak terbawa-bawa ah at least aku tak like macam
err apa nama dia
step ah step baik tak acknowledge ah I'm fine I'm fine
butoh I'm fine
kau hide it under the rug wonder the rug will be big enough sia kau dah tak tahu mana nak buang kau punya angry
dah berapa lama ah
tiga puluh tiga puluh thirty three
okay ah this is about korean show ah eh korang jangan judge aku
this one korean show aku tengok pun sama pasal apparently this one kid
macam dia nya life just
memang fucked up ah memang rabak ah but then she work inside this company whereby dia banyak tolong orang ah but then at the same time
sampaikan orang tap
into other people's phone untuk dengar conversation semua
terus friendly orang yang this guy another guy in dia nya company kira orang dia baik gila ah macam bukan nak cakap baik gila but then he's
entah macam very straight ah with dia nya principles dia kira cakap sometimes certain things kau shouldn't kalau kau dengar
kau shouldn't say
certain things kau dengar kau just keep it to yourself pasal kalau kau benda benda macam gini eh kau boleh disrupt orangnya friendship even though macam aku dengan kau gini kan aku dengan kau macam okay depan korang aku baik
belakang korang aku might be talking shit but sometimes that is the kind of thing that sometimes people just want to express dorangnya feelings it's not meant for the other person to hear ya
so dia cakap I know you're working but kau kena fikir balik apa kau buat pasal this kind of things it will disrupt orangnya life
that's why macam pada aku orang yang macam step baik kan whenever someone said something bad they will assume oh dia ni jahat
pasal kau tak pernah acknowledge anger you don't understand anger
macam aku just nak cakap jer ah aku not satisfied with this what's wrong with that
sebab tu that time aku sangkut sia cakap ni apa ah ah nama cerita dia is my minister
bagus sia
it's not about a okay ah very like ten per cent about love like the most is about dia punya how fucked up the whole situation is ah
pada aku semua cerita best ah korea ke apa ke
that's why aku quite shocked sekarang macam aku quite interested to macam tengok like korean shows
pasal dorang kan kalau kau tengok balik korean they are very well attune to dorangnya feelings
tu pasal aku suka tengok cerita lucifer
oh asal pasal yang macam dia acknowledge whatever feelings pasal he's not human mm he's not human abeh dia jumpa psycho ah psychopath pula dia jumpa psychiatrist dia and dia talk about feelings oh ya
and like macam the way dia take it like macam oh aku feeling this way eh is it ah that kind of thing ah so macam interesting
wah then dalam one of dia nya show dorang aku dengar this this guy cakap
macam dia tak tahu tak tahu apa dia nak tak tahu apa what's going on around the world dia buat hal dia macam gini sakit hati kau mampus ah macam gitu ah dia clueless about everything around
sun tzu cakap dekat art of war
I mean if you look at life as a war kan macam everyday is a constant battle ah
you can battle with a lot of things ah dia kata
kau kena tahu diri kau kau dah tahu the people around you ah
whatever everything kau pada aku aku boleh relate ni benda ah and then like
macam walaupun bila orang tu buku ni dia tulis untuk war pe but then you can look at it into business in life
macam battle ah for example
sekarang eh
the battle is for me to win korangnya hearts boleh cakap gitu pe
abeh macam I trying to win a friendship I want to get this kinship between us that's a battle also pe so kau nak kena tahu diri kau kau kena tahu kau punya people apa kau suka pasal apa kau suka apa apa kau tak suka and then from there aku boleh win the battle lah
aku pernah sia that time tengok after that watching dia nya like the series kan aku balik rumah aku just hate everyone
that's walking around aku sia aku macam like fuck sia korang like
aku macam aku tengok semua orang macam korang like do you guys see all these things that's banyak orang tak nampak
ah macam sial lah tak ah macam like these kinds of things that happened in the dark ah macam usually orang nampak semua macam let's say
a'ah from apa orang tunjuk jer pe
pasal sometimes no matter how bad the person is also kan kau nak kena tahu like what make him that way
tapi pada aku macam no matter how bad the person pada dia dia dia betul ah ya lah that's why like macam ada orang kata like
someone else's war is someone else's peace something like that lah dia punya line
it's like pada aku like macam wow it's like kalau kau nak kahwin
kau nak anak kau islam kau tak boleh kahwin dengan orang christian pe mm pasal pada dia minum no problem whatever dia believe in is different than yours
so to them after that korang gaduh then tak boleh cakap salah siapa pasal korang believe in different things
ya lah means like dia macam
that time adik aku pernah cakap ah dia bilang aku cakap kalau let's say eh the relationship korang gaduh in a relationship kan korang gaduh make sure korang berbual with each other face to face mm then gaduh quarrel with inside
ah that's not me ah yes kalau kau nak quarrel dengan aku kau quarrel dengan aku aku sendiri
macam that time aku text mata air aku dia kata apa
kau mesti ingat eh kalau aku tumbuk sesiapa sekarang kan okay let's say aku tumbuk kau kan if you get punched the only pain yang aku with the puncher is accountable for is when dia punya fist hit kau punya muka other than that kan tu semua self-inflicting pain
ni macam yang johnny depp member amber heard ah
oh dia tu lagi satu sia kesian sia
berbual kan a'ah aku ada dengar sikit juga
johnny depp tengah kecewa
ah terus end up jadi pukul pula
in a way dia punya suara like they just dia bukan marah tau dia just disappointed with what she turns to ah
like sebelum tu aku nampak kau macam wah like she's that perfect girl then suddenly
once that's why macam
ah tu pasal ah
macam apa romanticism dia cakap like macam one thing dia tak suka pasal romanticism ah is
first love macam
kau tengok jer kau dah tahu tu dia punya kau punya love one he questions the one kau tengok kau belum kenal that person tau
macam everything is based on feelings
abeh dia kata the only normal person eh
semua orang semua tak normal actually semua orang messed up
kau tak tahu dia punya problem tu pasal dia kata like macam
it's best to have a communication ah like macam bila kau jumpa orang kan I rather don't believe in like oh dia ni cantik ah kalau kau rasa dia cantik maknanya kau suka dia physically then after that kau get to know that person ah
then slowly like macam
ah then work things out from there ah you have to know like macam oh
does dia love aku macam
cause some people dalam dia some people
pasal when it comes to love kan cause suffering also come to place juga
dia dia dorang ada ratio dia
banyak orang kita can vibe with
best sia romanticism nya talk pasal I mean
even though aku suka dengar pasal tu kan it's not that aku tak romantic as well at all tau
like macam eh I cannot behave this way towards my girlfriend cause it will make her have this romantic mindset which would actually damage the relationship in the future
err ya like macam gitu ah expectations ah like macam a lot of the things ah like macam merepek ah tak masuk akal ah
aku need kau ada Twitter tak lis
tak pakai ah tapi ada dekat handphone kau
pasal aku nak kena tengok some examples ah
eh actually aku boleh ah tengok pakai ni aku boleh record sambil ni takpe aku tengok Twitter dari aku punya ni
handphone then aku aku highlight some of the romantic romanticism punya ah ni
vulnerable lah like macam kau takut nak jadi vulnerable
a'ah kau tak nak
oh azmi ah azmi cakap apa
si azmi pun
dia kes dia punya orang pun dia apa tau dia kata macam dulu dia macam kita macam baru kenal dia kata diam dulu relax
but then what make him change was he went travelling then like macam only on the third day baru dia berbual dengan orang terus macam dia punya last day kan ataupun orang tu last day
terus macam eh sial ah gerek gila sia
when I can talk to you in the first day and then we have a great time together sejak dari situ dia just macam open jer ah dengan semua orang dia boleh berbual ada selamba jer dia berbual jer ah
you cannot force the process ah macam kalau dia cakap gitu aku pun takleh expect anyone to oh betul eh aku try gitu cannot cause you have not gone through that process
you never truly understand it ah so if you skip the process memang
plus kita busy with a lot of things
err apa nama dia ah to throw away ah
and like really ni satu annoying perempuan pergi screenshot mata air dia gi send
tak this is all the stuff that aku scroll aku nampak ah
perempuan love this kind of shit pe
panjang gila mampus eh macam si dia tu highlight ah
err apa nama dia dia kata romantic romanticism can only be practised pada orang yang tak kerja orang yang tak ada goals in life
macam you want that macam that is not healthy sia
macam hundred of hundred per cent of your time or ninety per cent eighty per cent is being
err spend on someone tau dia macam just talk shit just make yourself feel better I love you you love beautiful that kind of thing kau spend pages tu semua
kau tahu macam you can spend time writing this tapi kau tak boleh write benda-benda yang lagi berfaedah
like macam
ah like macam god meant to take someone macam sial ah
ni cantik cantik tell him queen
macam ah
hais sial laki ni ha padahal aku belum tengok dia kata laki ni sial I mean like oh okay so you have to lie now
dan ah macam dulu dan macam oh thanks bro macam whoa best pe dan ada dekat sini
sekarang apa-apa dan buat nanti syahmi will find a reason to hate on it
pada aku ni macam a little bit romanticism in a way
I mean like macam
to to a certain extent okay lah there are some guys who just like openly like ni semua macam that's the thing like macam
aku tahu sia macam from experience I know girls
who secretly wants some guys sial lah living okay tak payah pergi jauh adam sendiri siak berapa banyak attached women go to him
the fuck is that abeh kau nak come to aku like macam kau nak pure gila nak mampus
macam no I only think of you macam
kau jangan bedek ah kita manusia ah sial
dia kata one of the things that
sex and marriage sex and love intertwine so dia kata apa tau
when you kira
and then err apa nama dia err
so they intertwine sex dengan love so if someone can treat you like good
bagus gila nak mampus tau
sweet tapi dia tak boleh fuck you well ah
kau terus down
kau macam oh this is not true love
or in a way ah tu pasal how I see it ah like most girls kan bila dia dah give themselves too easy to a guy
yang apa nama dia ini ah dia kata like macam so aku macam try to understand tau
kadang mata air aku ada sikit annoying ah which is aku understand pada aku like macam
dia believe in romanticism ah
before dia know aku pe so like err
I mean like it's a like confirm confirm tak boleh tau
and like macam kalau kau buat maknanya dah end of the story that kind of thing
it's not that aku nak main orang lain or what ah
but it's just that when you place that kan so slowly kau subconsciously
kau punya mind will go lower and lower in a sense that
err kalau apa nama dia that mind macam so kalau kau like orang lain kan sexually dah kira salah kalau kau have fun kalau that time dia ada issue with aku keluar kawan aku perempuan aku dah kenal dari dulu dah lama gila
terus dia tengok story macam eh you look you seem more happier with her tu aku dah kenal dia berapa lama macam aku aku happy pun salah ke
that kind of thing like macam so they will like if someone can replace can if someone can give him happiness
maknanya that person is for him then macam happiness comes in different form
so kau jangan think it the way just cause gini abeh kau down
abeh like macam oh dia dah tak suka aku like this
takleh keluar tak ada kawan tu semua that's what overthinking is a more commonly err
ya happen in that situation ah so macam all these toxic punya
toxic punya pemikiran ah
and like macam
pada aku most of the time kita tak gaduh it's just that disagreement jer ah like macam we talk about something disagree macam dan dengan ni
ah dan dengan mel
tapi tak sampai kita merajuk it's just that aku disagree atau certain things like macam dia kata I cannot sleep ah terus macam asal oh I
don't overthink kau bilang aku jer asal let me talk to you lah like macam
ease your mind sikit ah apa aku boleh buat dia cakap tak nak nanti menyusahkan kau
abeh terus nanti kalau dah bilang then after that dia come to conclusion that dia overthinking abeh dia ingat macam
oh aku selalu buat orang susah lah aku selalu macam kita kena gaduh pada aku ni tak gaduh
ini bukan gaduh it's just us communicating jer
can you stop pasal that's the thing
macam all these romanticism kan benda-benda gini fikir gaduh
pada dia kan love is love hundred per cent all the time having fun
that is like the the extreme err apa view of romanticism ah we have three more minutes my friend
dah terlalu banyak benda personal if you're listening to this
tadi korang cakap berbual pasal happiness pun macam
it's just like macam how orang europe confirm pergi holiday dekat bali
dia kata ee

bulan puasa seh
mm so moral of the story is don't marry a turkish man gitu eh
tak ah tak sangat ah
ah serious yang mana
ada ke seh anak buat mak gila
itu dabbe lah
ya it's not the mak buat
no mak dia kahwin kira dia dua ni mak dia dua ni dia orang bukan adik-beradik tau dia orang adik tiri
ya that but they don't know that dia orang adik tiri
ah it's not that the girl yang buat it's not the kakak yang buat tau
is it not the mak yang buat dulu ke
no mak dia yang buat dulu then terus dia punya hantu dengan jin tu pergi dekat kakak dia
yang dia nya yang dia nya best friend ada affair dengan dia punya husband kan
husband dia bunuh perempuan tu because of one gambar a'ah
but husband dia padan muka lah ya
siapa suruh cheat cheat on the best friend pula tu
she seek another doctor nya help tu kan dengan tukang ubat
but then kan kau ingat yang dia pergi yang dia punya yang dia pergi dekat tempat tukang ubat tu ke yang tempat doktor tu then ada satu budak perempuan tu yang boleh nampak-nampak barang kan dia cakap yang mulut dia kena paku kena begitu like what she did to herself
ya lah because they think macam why would a
jahat person come to seek for help
ya lah ya lah
ya lah but it's already written in the quran yang kau yang there's another world ya
eh tadi aku nak tanya apa eh
oh nanti dapat dia punya hundred dollars nya tu then they cannot stack the
pasal it's not like hundred dollars dia orang just hundred dollars again tau like it's break it's break it's broken into like maybe twenty dollars aku rasa
they say macam ada satu tempat tu yang dia punya fish and chips ke burger dia sedap
bedek eh
mak dia penakut ah
I don't know I've never ride the mummy before masa tu aku rasa
was either long queue atau tengah
then that time aku naik yang jurassic park kan basah kan after that kau tahu aku pergi mana yang tea cup nya
because I dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi there was this one yang dekat tempat tak ingat lah dekat tempat mana but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree habis aku kan
habis aku kan
buat christmas tree kan dulu
so aku pergi dekat aku macam aku nak pegang-pegang sekali tiba-tiba benda tu move tu aku terkejut
tak sis mak kau
because it managed to macam scare aku ah tu aku macam
ya he was laughing pasal macam aku kan susah nak takutkan a'ah then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu
sixty something sama lah aku rasa
but one of the scariest is aku punya kawan ya tak pun yang the kak pon clan and she also looked like kak pon ah that one
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like kak pon
a'ah she is one of the ni lah kira kak pon punya scarers lah but she never entah lah dia tak cakap apa-apa pun
kan I wanted to go seh because aku rasa
yang hari tu aku pergi pun the the year before aku pergi the only thing that scared me was the
sabah dia orang macam buat sabah punya voodoo shit begitu
ya lah
dia no dia macam ah aborigine punya ni ah orang that apa tu
what is that called orang asli orang asli
it's not really macam scary
aku suka eh benda begini
sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu kan and then they were like saying yang sis huzairi ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua then suddenly dia punya kawan just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time macam
lain hari ah then ah then they were like macam apa seh engkau tiba-tiba ah then sekali I think he texted or cakap ah the next time err or like call or something aku pun tak ingat
mmhmm dia dekat situ then dia cakap ah eh dia balik ah then after that ah baru dia cakap ah tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang kan
habis ah then they say lah macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
there's no such thing as ghosts what there's only jin
I don't know ah because like macam hari tu aku tengok yang incredible tales tu kan they say their ah kong is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then a'ah for the departed then they just macam dia orang tak burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah so he went back to the house
okay but I got this one question for you habis kalau if you are poor what even can you do
it's not the worst sin lah but they believe that macam
ya lah but kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun it's not it's not a
you want to bunuh people with what seh I don't know you have don't have anything what
ya but at the point of time it's not kira dia macam you are not of sound mind tau at the point of time
ya but then that's the only kira macam that's the only sin lah kan
betul lah that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
tak juga no I mean like islam is fair because macam dia orang akan
akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau and then after that if you have your buruk and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your buruk but then after that you will be given a chance to
taubat lah that's why got
I asked this question during umrah
ya lah then that's why I say that's why that time I was in umrah then they they was talking about this lah like ah before we went to umrah we have like the course kan habis dia orang tanya lah macam okay then bila kita zaman ah this ustaz macam rock rock sikit lah habis dia cakap then bila kita zaman time zaman rock kita pun terlepas solat then dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat lah solat taubat then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back macam qada because you know you don't know how many
how would I know siapa kita nak judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga just because dia kasi air dekat anjing tu so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to pertikaikan kita punya amalan
kalau aku pun aku bunuh sia aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa
but he already bunuh the ustaz
ya lah that's why kan aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting sis kan aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki ah tapi dah maki lah tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda word this word is for another word but actually kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu
mm maki jer
that's why macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah plus point dah malaikat dah tulis dah oh dia nak solat ah dia terus nak pergi tak oh tak dia tak pergi tapi tak minus tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya ya then if kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak oh nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai lah orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu and dia buat jahat then baru dia orang tulis
it makes it macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam because
like orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya sister sister nak sembahyang pun sister nak solat kita buat jer yang wajib
doesn't mean like you don't wear your tudung your amalan is lesser than
yang spaghetti bolognese punya hook tu aku cakap apa tu yang
lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that aku ni ah aku ni perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people lah
oh sis lagi kena teruk everytime I wear tudung then people all like macam cakap aku ni macam-macam
it's not about step good good ah dia macam macam ah alah perempuan tudung ni semua you know the guys that I like get to know right they say macam perempuan tudung ni
actually senang jer
macam kira senang dapat ah
it doesn't matter lah I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just apa kita
like I think those kind of things so so macam
mengghairahkan and
siapa nurul
the cantik one
she what her display picture ah yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab
no I mean like macam you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
tak ah sis more aware ah
but how to makan ah with niqab so you just open like that then makan I mean like ya ya lah
ya but then macam that's how people see you as a hijabi ah so when kau macam jatuhkan judgement dekat niqabi when orang jatuhkan judgement as
dekat kau as a hijabi then kau macam tak boleh terima
but actually macam betul lah cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
ilmu lah kenapa kau nak pakai niqab so engkau punya journey
so macam kau punya journey tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu
dia macam there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
tapi macam okay speaking of this eh I was like thinking tau masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam very ah small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and dia orang punya tulang is very small so like
not say macam fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then macam bila aku pakai eh aku rasa macam then I was saying this to nek yam you know then I was like macam eh habis nanti orang pakai habis macam
you know all these people macam pakai macam terletak jer then macam for me is like terletak and then tiba-tiba macam shoulder besar
and shoulder besar and then like then macam tergantung ah macam tergantung kita macam hanger so it's like it's not nice ah pada aku then after that nek yam said something that macam terus macam aku terus ugh
macam then she say you wear things you want to wear a niqab you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of allah
sis terus shut up lah
ya lah but doesn't mean kau presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just macam kau tak boleh change diri engkau
dapat sis looking at her
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time macam she became a basic
but then macam but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly ringarde lah
in dunia lah mmhmm
tapi macam kalau kau dah actually kau pakai hijab jer kau dah kena sacrifice all these things seh slowly lah
dia macam ah there's one application that I tried is ah mystery shopper
so then they pay you upfront ke or they
that means doing the pharmacy punya side lah but the problem is I have to
I can only work until december but then dia orang cakap cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the uh apa ni we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
mm tapi dekat jems kau
ya I can actually kerja dekat uh sana kan if they can ini but then too bad
that's why then another one I tried is uh apa ni
but that one is uh apa ni that one pun uh ada shift ah seven to
even uh temperature taking also they ask you to apa ni they will ask you to commit for at least
tapi dormitories is very risky because
no because sometimes it's up to the apa tu management to
tapi nanti dia last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before lah macam like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully tak ada change
tapi kalau ada change then susah lah how am I going to call the ini kan the other job
correct that's why I think my colleague kan dia tak nak she doesn't want to do this uh macam because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
ya she requested for a full time tapi bagus kau dia punya because of
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these ah tapi because of dia punya qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's dia dia pun I think on work pass eh
mm because we cannot my current employer dia cakap if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal lah but so just log in apa
it will I think there's some law thingy ah and then kesian kan all these uh
passes holder like because what they are thinking is dia orang nak save on rental
ah then down there tak ada imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
kesian seh
because dia cakap that time kan ah during the COVID period then all these malaysian tak boleh balik
the father passed away a few years back lah so he staying the whole house alone and then dia cakap ah he advertise on gumtree um
apa ni dia cakap ada all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
with aircon and with uh that's it tak keluar pun and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas si azman ni pula uh dia kerja
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself tak kecoh-kecoh you know
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how dia cakap cooking because all male
uh I think five room also ah dekat woodlands
tu dia cakap uh because his pay was uh cut I think about thirty percent eh thirty
thirty percent ke forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he kena cut
but I guess it's okay lah because he's a guy abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik unlike macam perempuan kan suka keluar
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle lah macam ada job ada job tak ada job tak ada job anyway I have extra income
tak boleh order tak boleh keluar makan I mean like once in a while
so that's why then what about your side your company okay tak
those who are urgently need to balik kampung or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
are mostly macam like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya resume apa semua then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
ya I guess tapi ten K eh
she said she rented one condo dekat uh harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
tapi bila sometimes ah when it comes to their private travel ah wah then the the wife can be bossy
that's why sometimes I hear complain from ah macam
ah I also got one experience because apa ni dia punya secretary punya boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then ah uh every year they have this uh macam trip home trip lah so call home leave
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves um so if they don't use and then just rugi lah it's like forfeited
then lepas tu kan nanti along the way there will be changes of course
uh apa ni kenapa deduct eh I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so dia cakap uh did he upgrade or any he asked me to check dia kata bila krisflyer actually deduct salah or what
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything uh we didn't do any claim lah check punya check rupanya wife dia
aku tanya dia uh apa ni so the
ya funny right can you imagine he sekali ah he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what sekali ah the
dia punya wife claim everything siao
ah every time like that nanti karang uh apa tu you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to macam-macam lah
ya because the fare pun if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that uh got no rule ah macam
yes lepas tu the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes dia bising
susah seh but you never know what sometimes ah last minute changes or last minute nak kena pergi sana pergi sini
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't ini
remember that time yang kau punya si ex
terbalik right
aiya for actually for them ah definitely they want to they will apa ni push push to somebody what
book lepas tu tak check and then just give
baru dia cakap don't don't repeat the same mistake
ni apa flight actually you take
no I think it's expensive pasal ah it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
actually ho chin minh ada banyak flight apa vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
other than that ada budget airlines
of course it's not funny lah you crazy macam I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
tak messy sangat pasal kan if you were to do like that ah macam like
macam departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date tau dia bukan macam
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling ah it's very messy so you have to see macam
aku cuma ambil yang departure on the saturday
tak pasal the different website got different allotment why sometimes ah like macam ah agoda they got ten ten room
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked tapi bila you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
tapi actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
tapi okay ah because okay lah macam let's say it's individual booking
I'm sure they have their own bilik tau
nanti they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you tak from this company this company ah so it's easier
I think it's china hong kong tak payah visa
tapi kalau china visa ah
ah apa tu passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
ah you can still it depends ah tapi
kalau if they are travelling around asia pac ah you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
cuma kalau dia declare as tourists then they don't need
tapi tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you lah
but luckily tak payah I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia jump
it's just the you know dia punya screw dia terpleot
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover tapi
the company is like neither here nor there kalau kau apply for a job and let's say you get a job
susah lah
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin punya tu is under recruitment agency no harm just go lah anyway they just want to collect data what
dia orang nak test concept eh like concept of a show
oh iya lah
what you have to watch a show first then kalau kalau kau tak suka
ah eh who who are they like new faces ke orang lama tak ada like popular artistes
I don't know I used to I mean like my parents used to watch it all the time right suria so when they have the on kadang-kadang kalau ada show yang macam okay okay then I'll sit and watch ah but to be honest I cannot remember any any specific title
ah ya like it's just like macam background noise gitu
tapi macam I I mean the content okay kadang-kadang like the some documentaries there was one with um that girl dalila I don't know the girl with that cornrow hair
ah dalina dalina during bulan puasa ah bulan puasa macam kadang-kadang like sebelum buka then baru will watch
kalau tak macam err
oh my goodness mentang-mentang ada library eh kat situ dia orang dia orang dengki eh ya
kan aku dah lama seh tak pakai zoom call
oh ya jannah ya ya I can force jannah then kalau kalau aku berbual seorang
oh ya ah you have your but eh then where where is your sister dia tidur kat mana seh
nice eh tengok tengok tengok sikit
tu anjing eh
abeh apa oh lah horse ya allah
anjing eh eh cantik
cantik seh babe is that ros in the photo
oh ya ya betul betul betul
macam-macam lah kau mengarut
oh okay okay cause like right now there's a lot of discussion about kalau you dah age thirty you must have at least hundred K in your bank account that kind of thing
like a a a real high flyer then of course you can save a lot more lah cause right now a lot of like twenty five years old are saying oh I already saved fifty K then you no need to get married meh no need to buy ke you know ya then still spend money what
oh no then sekarang are you actually stress about the wedding or stress about all these things that you feel you're stress about or
aku ingatkan kau fikir banyak sangat ah
ya kalau kalau kalau bukan ros kalau robert kalau alah apa-apa jer lah sebab kau rasa macam robert you know would have the financial means
but the think is russell financial means are also above average jadi you know apa yang tak cukup ni sorry kau
is it dia
right but then cause of COVID and then they say oh people will are only gonna start flying in twenty twenty four then ya lah rasa takut tu mesti ada right sikit
oh okay okay okay that's nice so now your loan amount berapa
eh thirty three dengan hundred jauh beza seh
wah that is okay lah tak apa kau kau cepat-cepat collect then
ya two percent then tak apa lah just pay lah five hundred every month then after that you slowly accumulate your wealth back again and then you can invest the rest what cause you can always make your investment grow more than two percent so that's the logic behind it lah
mana dia nak cari masa nak do relief teaching on the side
ya tu pasal lah then banyak seh burden dia banyak burdens to bear
kesian hais I know
but like what could they possibly be bringing home eh dalam banyak-banyak itu baggage gitu
so so in the end flight tu delay ke tak
tak makan briyani
that macam dah naik muak dah twenty four hours alah apa lagi thosai
eh wait eh cannot hear you the hotel room itself like it's very rundown eh macam
ah okay lagi dekat sana eh
so so they keep knocking on his door and eh hello ah your makanan is here
wah that is so irritating dia mesti dia mesti marah seh
more but but if he only flew off on the nineteen masih ada lagi banyak hari seh for him to kena quarantine kan

ya lah tapi masalah dia
err yang
uh dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
ya boleh masak lah tapi
and those kind of things lah macam nasi putih nasi
err jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu lah baru saya boleh buka
sebab because at schools they have err
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ lah because
so tapi
sekarang now we are
saya tahu lah apa itu kalau tak ada
ya mm maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik I mean it's baik overall lah it's good
ya so kalau
err tak ada lah tak ingat
with these variations I I I'm a bit like macam old fashioned lah
masa saya pergi india dulu
err ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
like macam senapang tau
err tapi dia pergi macam
uh paddy field itu ada banyak burung
burung the one
err apa itu yang warna putih itu yang kaki dia panjang itu apa nama dia
so this pakcik
err will go then they they suka hunt these birds
then they bawa
they bawa then people with cook the meat
err but dia punya daging dia agak it's not soft like chicken tapi agak keras juga lah tapi I only remember I had that once
ya itu sahaja saya try
ya tapi sekarang masa itu saya kecil
sekarang now I'm grown up
bukan itu bukan maksud itu err macam jalan-jalan travel saya tak kisah I'm talking about food
food means all food I'm okay with all food except like macam
um saya boleh rasa macam okay just to taste lah once or twice but I will not make it like my daily consumption kind of thing tak ada
yes harap-harap corona ini over lah so we all can
okay let's say I I tengok satu jam atau dua jam
tapi saya saya err I'm
I sekarang saya suka yang not drag too much
story macam dia punya like short stories lah
macam yang err dia punya
kisah itu habis dalam masa let's say for one dalam one hour two hour tak drag drag drag sampai you know for few episodes ah macam itu saya tak ada patience nak tengok macam
ya it's short I mean apa itu orang cakap apa eh
ya macam itu semua saya suka lah
bila eh
oh twenty twenty three they keluar
macam like um I I also like all the superhero movies
no it's not that aku tak suka cuma I didn't err saya tak you know I didn't sit
the most I I think I watch will be spiderman lah yang banyak
yang saya tengok itu mungkin spiderman tak banyak sangat
bukan lah maybe that's what it's uh
so uh saya nak tanya eh
so you after your sekolah kan after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
yang itu hari err
yang sofian buat what internship itu it's research more to research right
so you pergi
kan sekarang cuti sekolah
tapi uh you mean
tapi yang you
err punya classmate yang dekat A level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after A level ada your friends take the same course
so um sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
tak boleh lah mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
itu lah saya nak like I said
nak buka business
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home lah
mah do something like ecommerce ke
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
err macam you know unexpected
err bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
I wish lah if orang yang macam
so they get I think government ada juga lah bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi I wish they
ya itu maybe we can
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
itu satu err swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
err dekat itu
err apa
ya sebab err coach itu boleh datang
mm dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
I mean uh last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like uh not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own mm but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
ada dia punya itu lah result
so um berenang itu
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
your you know like macam
ada pilates
satu jam is it a group class
dekat mana jurong
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
active itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada uh ya obviously I go for that
active belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
itu dekat redhill
so far lah because the coach um yang coach can only come there
ya like I said dulu punya coach itu
the coach uh tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada lah ajar sikit-sikit but I know I would I will take with some
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
no bread toast is just I like lah but not mm not I eat something that I eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
like macam
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa eh
ah saya tak tahu lah awak
maggi mee
the nasi arab itu
ya smoke sebab smoke itu tak kuat smoke
then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
itu bukan keras lah itu
ya tak tak tapi
pizza dekat mana
err you need a little bit of minyak sapi
err depends lah if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak lah because it's only one cup of rice
then cengkih is clove
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
err you letak garam
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
err nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
uh nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit lah
mm then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
you uh boleh letak chilli hijau semua lah then you put half half lah separuh
uh then the same method you put the uh garam
the other one the taste will be macam kenduri punya nasi lemak lah
ya that one is more like uh is uh more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with uh curry chicken
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah
you punya sekolah itu boleh pakai
you you boleh bawa itu uh
is like it acts like macam bila you nak masak soup with I mean like maggi
boleh nasi boleh lauk pun boleh you only need that one pot which call magic pot I don't know
boleh beli kalau you nak boleh beli yang
entah apa brand lah but I can recommend you few brands

so how long ago was this and berapa
dia punya amount
wait but kinda guy macam like can't he go to a licensed one

dia macam degil kind of guy ya
tak macam masalah dia it is that kind of thinking like
nanti your issues will like snowball
snowball anjing punya
pinjam duit shit
making macam
co-curricular activities kau tahu
but aku aku macam thinking more of on the lines of
macam you ask me to get a guard

I was wondering kalau
matair jer
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him ah macam you know I understand where he's coming from sebab
help help that's a fucking understatement kan ya but macam
in a in a very tough spot aku macam put it in a more personal light ah I'm saying that I totally not okay
like would you still hang out with me tak
and then macam cakap
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then dia macam maki sekejap ah
abeh he said that he said that ultimate like pakcik thing to say that ah that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this one pakcik thing but he said the other part pakcik thing
nanti aku tak boleh focus
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you aku masih boleh
lepak dengan kau ah kind of thing
aku macam okay
let's say kau nak main macam devil's advocate kind of thing
so what do you feel about the difference macam in terms of
okay but what do you think of her macam dia punya character and such
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from ah macam aku faham but I don't think it's matter of gender tau
bodoh gila pe
sama sama situation as us ah
bulgy chonkers juga tau
dia punya their food
kan dorang punya makanan
the portion kan besar gila
tapi there's no incentive too you know
but that one also doesn't paint like err macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
okay uh as a brown guy here aku pun free education ah up to a point
we get sidetrack macam anjing
other factors juga
err apa nama dia
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
punya urge to choke slam dia is like rising ah it's
like the underlying issue is still there apa like he's basically not happy
it's a dengki thing ah
but if you see me tons of time aku mana iron anything
no but it's one of those things that it just macam it creeps up on you
sebab ah asian dengan
wait wait ah kau sixty one right
kind of situation aku macam I was eighty six kilo sia
aku used to have an issue about eating ah I don't why like I I was constantly lapar like hungry
but you eat you wake up in the morning kira kan macam
ravenous nak mampus
so macam um I think they were doing like is
macam no no no
aku dah macam yo
is it dah macam you know like
no it's not so much muz ah muz macam
so he was first I said okay but it was that kind of okay macam
suka hati ah you know that kind of thing
ah kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues pasal
aku pun nak join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've um contemplated about lah some of them macam not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is zakat
dia macam cakap oh it doesn't feel transparent
betul ah that's what fahim adhere
no not my family dinner at simpang kan
ah aku dah
aku dengar tu aku dah macam oo
roma dah stand at attention
so I kau jangan cakap gini ah
macam you cannot expect a marriage now what doesn't make sense right
just the show juga
oh he ajak me again like today's friday but aku macam
oh no no aku have
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit kau tahu
this makes sense aku aku faham
australia eh tak
azam baru dengan veganism
mm mungkin dalam
tapi depend juga lah sebab tengok
err ada
ada have ada deteriorate ke
atau ada apa-apa yang mengubah persepsi dalam morality
depends lah you rasa macam mana
tapi macam ada standpoint morality
apa you punya
oh sebab tu rasa selfish ah
mm itu dia panggil cognitive dissonance err basically
bila you tengok
err dekat certain negara
you boleh tengok dekat YouTube
yang buat video dia tengah makan anjing macam yang video orang korea selalu buat dia kan makan makanan ah jadi kat situ kelakar tau sebab
kita boleh nampak dislike pada video orang yang makan anjing tu banyak tapi bila dia makan steak biasa
ah banyak jer like lepas tu korang comments semua yang elok-elok lah cakap sedap lah tapi bila yang anjing tu ramai yang dislike then bagi comment
yang marah lah marah sebab makan anjing tapi kat situ macam mana dia agak
mm sebenarnya tu memang argument yang orang selalu pakai
err tapi dekat situ timbul satu problem macam mana intelligence satu sentient being diukur macam mana dia orang measure
so dah jadi satu problem kat situ
kalau I sendiri ah rasa mm morally memang kita salah lah kalau nak ikut daripada standpoint moral
I suka juga tengok daripada satu
daripada satu uh
evolutionary standpoint yang mana
kita dah dah mutated dah evolved
sentient being lain though so dah in a way dah adapt sebab tu bila kita cuma nak tinggalkan
mm tradition bukan tradition tinggalkan diet tu dia bagi kesan sampingan pada badan lah sebab banyak juga
orang-orang yang ex-vegan yang dah
last sekali dia orang
dia orang tinggalkan juga veganism sebab
health semakin teruk kan
ah in fact baru five thousand years dari ya yang yang recorded lah five thousand years baru start ada
before that takde yang dikenal pasti lah
itu masa mesopotamia kan
tak I akan start dengan vegetarian dulu sebab macam biasa ah ni
ramai orang yang cakap benda yang sama dia tak boleh tinggalkan cheese
telur yes yes tak boleh
last kita makan beef pun bila
a'ah ah tapi okay lah kira itu tahun lepas punya cerita ini sekarang tahun baru
mm tapi kita kan pernah discuss sebelum ni kalau macam susah
kalau tak nak nampak poyo kita kena buat buat ada macam health issue macam ada allergy ke makan makan meat products
ada allergy jadi kita boleh pura-pura ada
ada illness ah ada penyakit yang tak boleh yang membuatkan kita tak boleh
oh ya lah rasa serba salah rasa guilty dia dah masak kan
I was many tak tahu pun
just just fikir bila dah tengok banyak
banyak debate
then dia macam dia start to make sense lah bila
discussion pasal morality issues
mm back then I consider juga standpoint yang lagi satu lah yang memang
kalau ikutkan daripada organism yang pertama pun memang dia
even plants pun evolve daripada organism yang
yang first
mostly pasal philosophy yang mana yang mana start
start into into betul pun lepas
and jadi banyak masa untuk
untuk reflect
untuk fikir err meaning of life
and then macam-macam lah err
argument macam-macam discussion dapat
dapat tengok sebab free sangat kan banyak free time masa pandemic ni
so daripada situ
dapat counter balik
dapat counter balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni
bincangkan pasal veganism
dia macam selalu irritating kan annoying macam mana ah
tapi err recently lah dah start macam okay nampak ah kenapa dia
dia make sense
mm ya lah source of protein tu senang nak dapat ya especially is buat tempeh lah
and boleh replace
kita sendiri pun makan sandwich yang hidang dengan tempeh
tapi still once in a while memang rasa craving untuk
err beef too especially bila bayangkan steak
um yang medium rare ah
kat situ lah jadi problem tu dia kita ni
bunuh other sentient being untuk bagi pleasure pada taste bud kita mm ada juga orang yang
yang counter balik dia cakap okay and then macam mana handling dengan nyamuk macam mana dengan err lipas
takkan kita tak boleh nak bunuh kan
err dekat situ itu persoalan yang lain
mm dia orang invasive macam lipas nyamuk ni invasive so dia bukan macam
err lembu lembu kita factory farm and then kita bagi dia life yang teruk just for the sake untuk dapatkan
product just for the sake untuk
ah ha sebab lembu tu dia tak pernah kacau orang pun dia tak ada ah masuk rumah and then hisap darah ke
tapi pun ada juga yang yang certain vegan yang memang sampai to the extremes dia orang tak bunuh nyamuk they just tiup jer a lot macam tu jadi ah yang tu extreme sangat kot
I mean kalau kalau kalau creature lain human ke animal ke
kalau dia start untuk invade tu kita ada right untuk ni lah self-defence lah
anjing ke kalau dia kejar ah kita boleh ah baling batu ke
dia tak nak right untuk
apa-apakan dia lah
macam nak belajar serious pasal philosophy
apa lagi ah
tak tahu you start dulu nanti I boleh tiru you
ya lah tak even even for me as a musician
mm mm dia tak tak strong rasa macam nak
nak improve bukan
ada lah rasa nak improve tapi nak sebab nak practise tu dia macam tak motivated sangat dia macam ada nak
nak cari benda lain mm mm I mean music tu kita punya
kita punya career tapi
dia dia stay macam tu lah then kita akan improve tu maybe while ah then while while working while performing
mm mm itu memang
memang best
mm mm tapi sia
almost apa memang lah
vaccine pun
february baru masuk malaysia kita pun tak tahu ya ke tak singapore dah
mm a'ah jadi pasal language ya I tengah focus juga dengan nak focus greek ah greek dulu lepas tu italian yang
yang senang-senang ah dulu
mm mm mm japanese tu dia considered as
uh dia orang pernah sort of difficulty kan then lepas tu
err hardest language to learn lah dia ada sekali dengan arab tapi yang tu dia measure dia ikut ni err
perspective orang orang yang
yang speak english ah mm tapi mungkin untuk kita asian
maybe japanese tak susah mana kot
ah dia among the easiest
a'ah latin juga sebenarnya latin mm
aduh susah lah tak pernah ada azam
dia benda-benda yang beyond beyond our control macam contohnya nak nak border dibuka semula
tapi tu lah dia kena ni benda tu beyond our control lah yang
yang in our control
tak tahu ah sebab rasa macam semua benda boleh dapat sekarang
desire tu macam tak tahu nak apa ah
ya lah memang
memang takde takde isu pun lah twenty twenty tu cuma travel restriction jer lah itu jer
walaupun restricted pun kita dapat juga daripada penang ke perak ke johor
december ya lah sebab kita dapat hanya
mm working from home lepas tu dengan dia sebab dia new experience kan kita buat voice voice acting gitu
benda yang kita tak pernah buat jadi ah okay ah
predict ah apa apa yang malaysia akan
tahun ni lah ah twenty twenty one yang dia ah
ah predict lah macam mana
mm but then again memang ramai lah yang buat online content cuma lama-lama tengok rasa macam
boring juga sebab
mm contoh
contoh macam music lah kalau yang lain okey-dokey kalau yang macam discussion debates semua okay lagi kalau yang music ni macam lama-lama jadi boring ah tengok online ah redundant lepas tu
lepas tu tengok bayangkan lah dah err you have to pay the ticket but
memang lah dia orang buat dekat
ah venue venue yang ada sound system yang best
tapi still benda tu dia depend juga macam mana dengan uh audio system
audience masing-masing ada pakai err earphone yang murah earphone handphone mahal ke apa ke so dia still quality dia
tak main peranan sangat lah
mm mm especially kalau memang dah semua orang dah dapat vaccine betul
eh mesti lah
mesti ah mesti kita akan buat event
takde ah
it can kelakar jer tapi takpe ah kalau orang tak nak
ambil vaccine kan dekat sini kan memang err kalau
err siapa yang nak ambil vaccine itu could
ni lah secara sukarela kan volunteer kan
so biar lah yang tu
mm mm siapa yang tak nak tu kita serahkan kepada yes
I rasa nanti kalau macam dia jadi back to normal dia akan ada ya lah dia akan
um celebrate sekejap dia akan macam wow ah finally dunia luar
mm tapi rasanya benda tu takkan dia punya excitement tu dia takkan tahan lama pun dia macam sekejap jer and then orang lupa balik sebab
err even masa
pandemic ni pun dengan dengan semua orang ada internet memang literally semua orang ada
daripada socialising ah so macam dia dia
not a big deals sangat pun pandemic ni cuma memang lah ah physically
mm memang tapi uh physically memang lah dia orang crave untuk jumpa depan-depan tapi sebab ada internet ni
dan tu lah sebab tu nanti excitement dia akan sekejap jer
oh tapi err
nanti bila bila dah normal balik maybe semua orang boleh jumpa secara fizikal tapi dengan dengan perspective yang baru lah ah maybe sebab dia dah banyak spend time sebelum ni dia dia walaupun dia banyak free time untuk
err walaupun smartphone memang ada kat dalam tangan sentiasa tapi dia orang banyak tengok
macam content content yang wasteful lah yang macam setakat tengok meme jer
tapi masa pandemic ni macam ramai pula yang
dia tiba subscribed to a skillshare ah ambil
ah kelas-kelas yang macam-macam kan so dia dah start gunakan free time dia betul-betul and then dia betul-betul masuk ke dalam dunia internet yang positif ah
so dia dapat banyak gila input
ada shift
yes and no biasa jer biasa jer yes tu sebab
sebab kita travel kan kita dapat pergi
mm pergi keluar kita dapat
and then mm masa kita masuk pandemic baru nak start pun kita memang baru balik kan
so benda-benda tu memang rindu lah benda-benda tu tapi
daripada tahun yang pandemic ni pun
not bad juga so dia macam dah biasa
mm boleh lah memang
memang naturally stoic kot
rumit lah kan ah tak lah in in a nutshell dia just pasal
pasal being remaining neutral lah dia macam
bukan pessimist dan bukan optimist ni in a in a nutshell lah mm dia punya actual definition dia tak pasti lah macam mana tapi in a nutshell yang I faham
remain tegak jer tau ah macam
kalau benda teruk jadi yang beyond kita punya control and then apa yang kita boleh buat ah just
and then bila
datang satu benda excitement pun
jangan jangan terlalu ah jangan telalu absorbed jangan terlalu soaked in dalam feeling yang
yang kuat tau sebab nanti dia akan ada
apa pendulum effect
mm dia akan bidas balik
nihilism tapi tak lah nihilism
boleh lah nihilism ni dia just
except yang kalau kalau kalau
kalau life ni takde meaning pun
takpe lah sebab ada orang dia macam strive untuk cari meaning dia
tapi what if
memang takde meaning apa-apa memang
datang dan pergi macam tu jer kan just play along jer lah
ah memang ah
mm kalau ni memang banyak refer pada nature ah tapi
mm okay sebenarnya dia dia bukannya
err bukan yang teruk sebab ada juga term optimistic nihilism
mm mm before that memang ada encounter tu tapi good place tu dia macam lagi explaining dia explaining lah
mm kalau kau tak tahu pun macam tak tahu pun benda ni dibincangkan cuma
sebelum ni kita experience kan kita macam
mm start ada turning point untuk
ah rasa macam dapat revelation in something
and then bila tengok memang ada
memang ada study pasal ni err seronok lah sebab dia explain kan
mm hmm hmm memang lah memang tak boleh shaft pun tapi boleh
boleh introduce lah introducing okay tapi bila shaft
shaving new opinion tu
tak boleh lah
oh macam tu boleh cakap apa ah
macam tu boleh cakap lah
tak tau ah other than philosophy takde mmhmm
kali nak nak lebihkan pada scandinavian countries tu
mm sebab nak tengok
mm tengok system dia
mm ya lah yang tu semua memang nak repeat
tapi ah a'ah a
termasuk lah
kalau tak kan
lepas lepas bukan sweden denmark mm
euro centric tak tak western lah
sebab kita tak consider canada ya tapi
sebab dia punya ni kot dia punya historical value
kalau asian countries entah north korea
mm mm sebab tu
sebab tu macam history kat sini pun kadang-kadang dengar pun macam made up stories sebab dia tak perlu preserve kan
aiyo tak tahu pun
mm mm tapi the sangat kan
takde lah dia bukannya kalau being stoic ke macam terus eliminate ke
so sebab lagi muda lagi orang akan
ambil seriously kot sebab dia tengok macam umur lima belas dah start buat semua ni
lepas tu tapi still ambil lah sebab nanti mungkin boleh guna untuk summer study kan
mm apa lagi ah tukar
entah tukar nama tak ah tak tahu lah
takde tak against sangat pun against ah against against sekolah semua sekolah yang I pergi
I went to seven schools and takde yang betul-betul
dapat tarik interest untuk belajar kan dia punya
ya lah ini memang lah semua orang faham lah mm bukan kita jer faham semua orang tahu benda ni
kalau korang start
sembang pasal education system jer lah memang macam gini jer lah dia punya outcome
kat internet
tapi ada laptop kan
ambil ah
entah macam mana kalau lockdown lagi kan tak guna
bukan a'ah
hampa jer
mm lapan minit ni
boleh cakap pasal apa your hope was a upper you hook
pada home country you
boleh ke ah okay
uh sebenarnya stoic juga ah mm
tu lah change yang nak tengok
ya lah dia beyond kita punya control kan tapi still okay lah kalau betul ada change yang boleh nak tengok nak tengok
a'ah maknanya takde campur tangan
tak tak kesah lah politician ke sesiapa pun banyak yang kalau nak
some sort of gain dia akan main dengan
a'ah dengan sentiment agama kan mm
just kalau nak tengok ni boleh lah tengok kat Facebook comments jer dah cukup dah
so banyak yang memang tak
biasa ah benda ni biasa yang dia nampak tajuk jer lepas tu dia terus comment mm mm
itu pun uh itu
a'ah a'ah a'ah betul
kita kena blame juga journalism bad journalism dia memang
tak boleh ah dia dia kena fikir lah uh siapa
dia kena fikir juga untuk orang yang malas membaca ni dia kena bagi title tu memang terus
mm click bait okay tapi kalau kalau buat video YouTube okay kot
tapi kalau buat err news header jangan lah
sebab tu lah yang orang baca pasal vaksin ni juga ada side effect eh bukan side effect dia dah ambil ah
mm mm padahal baru ambil yang first shot tu kan
tapi orang terus rasa macam cakap oh K maknanya vaksin tak berkesan atau apa lah
ya lah memang itu yang dia jadi sepanjang adanya
it is err sejak kelahiran journalism
yang penting jalan yang penting dapat duit advertisement mm
tapi itu lah benda ni yang kita memang dah selalu sangat sembang teliti macam tu lah lagi authentic
mm kita dah bual benda ni dah dah berapa kali dah sebelum ni sorry
ini call of duty
contoh pergi makan ah
kita pergi makan ini lah seoul garden
pun boleh juga wakuwaku pun boleh juga
bawa duit ah wakuwaku mahal daripada seoul garden kan
can ah jalan masjid pun okay juga

mm but another can but another side of me yang in terms of ibadah semua itu memang problem lah
err twenty twenty was the disaster one but family akak berjaya habiskan puasa enam ah that one ah itu saja yang pasal ibadat

ah tapi ada memang ada lah yang bulan-bulan lain semua ada
okay and then um itu yang pertama yang kedua um
akak ready untuk jumpa psychiatric err yang itu yang kedua that one
aka rasa macam that one is a big achievement juga lah

err tak cukup lagi ida ida tak cukup
okay akak ada satu lagi top achievement akak
akak first time bayar zakat pendapatan
that one is the first one akak bayar zakat pendapatan alhamdulillah
okay okay okay ida ada lagi
what were the top five painful lesson that you learnt allah
okay akak dulu
staff yang kita orang baru ambil bekerja selama sebulan berhenti
okay dia cakap ya lah sebab macam kita orang tak dapat pindah then kalau pindah macam mana business dekat sini and so on kan so macam dia
ya lah mempertikaikan mengapa perempuan tak boleh ke buat business kan ha ah macam tu a'ah I don't know we don't know
the first one the second one ada juga staff yang berhenti
that is under our ini lah macam kita sponsor
satu team um e-sports
dia tak lah directly tapi that
because the person yang err handle yang team e-sport itu adalah among our business partners
yang our staff yang bukan lah our staff macam his staff yang berhenti itu kan
memang macam rude lah bahasa yang dia gunakan sangat rude
dia itu macam ini tak err bukan competence tak competence lah dia kata tak bagus lah apa semua memang rude
memang rude kalau baca message dia memang rude
a'ah itu ah macam kan kan sudah tak pernah kerja tempat lain tapi
tak apa lah okay so that one is second
ingat tak waktu bulan tiga apa yang berlaku we need to refund
fifteen K to uh our clients lah because waktu itu ah
project tak dapat jalan and COVID comes and then
actually dia orang nak minta kita bayar dua puluh ribu ah
tapi err we said to them yang kita kan sudah buat kerja sikit so kenapa nak refund full
so dia orang minta refund lima belas ribu then
that one is very tough lah untuk kita semua for her for us as a team and
for others lah juga untuk dia juga lah
and that one is better for her juga lah sebenarnya okay
okay so empat saja boleh tak
terlalu painful lah okay ida tak nak cakap tak nak cerita lima okay
waktu dia susah bukannya waktu kita susah lah okay
balik lah
mm mm cakap saja lah terus terang
okay yang awak rasa macam top lima yang memang awak rasa awak buat keputusan yang betul yang awak betul lah
ya sama
walaupun kita duduk seorang tapi rasanya macam yup yup tapi tak lah memikirkan masalah di rumah
okay that one is the first one sama dengan akak juga second one
okay alright teruskan teruskan
tempat asal lah tempat awak tinggal awak dapat tawaran dekat tempat asal awak lahir okay then
stay tempat yang ada sekarang tempat yang awak belajar lah
err saat rasa macam ada certain soalan macam a bit repeat lah
okay let's say sudah tak ada
apa ah top five things yang you got right is the first one is I made a
bukan lah ada bukan lah make decision pun I terpaksa pun untuk hantar thesis I supaya I dapat viva
nak kena mengasuh dia orang bagi faham lah apa benda lah lepas itu tak faham-faham juga
but then ada staff yang we got it right yang bagus
walaupun macam yang mungkin macam gaji yang kita bagi pun tak ini tapi we promise to her that we might be give you
better later because kita pun tak kaya kan
so kita tak nak lah share kekayaan itu di kalangan kita saja kita mesti nak share dengan orang lain juga
okay so I'm not sure it is the got right ke tak tapi
ah mempertimbangkan lah okay entah lah ada berapa sudah empat kan empat saja lah okay next question
okay akak dulu ah okay risiko terbesar yang akak ambil adalah
macam to from kelas mengaji err class mengaji physical to online fully
and memang struggle ya allah ya rabbi buat facebook live and so on macam gitu kan
tapi we managed to do that lah walaupun struggle
totally memang change and then after that we build um err jauhari
masih dalam progress and hero cilik waktu itu and like then juga shine untuk board game lah
tak ada okay we skip all that question then soalan keenam
what was the smartest decision you made dekat sama kan
okay tak payah lah okay next which three important relationship improved the most family tadi awak cakap lagi
alright okay dua okay so macam akak pun akak the first one is
err ya lah our relationship eh kita tak ada siapa-siapa kita dua orang saja ida okay with my room mate dengan ida
akak rasa akak better sikit dengan ayah akak kot
selama ini akak ada perception yang macam
anggap tak baik apa semua kan tapi bila akak macam bantu dia untuk kerja sekejap
kak kak nampak lah dia usaha dan dia struggle
kak relationship dengan itu lah ah okay okay
ah that guy okay cuma
ya lah macam dulu kan akak ini macam lelaki ini apa teruk ah apa semua kan but right now okay just be understanding lah okay nombor sembilan
dia beri greatest impact dekat ida lah
okay aduh sebab
ya lah sebab tahun ini kan kita jarang masa bersama dia kau orang okay untuk akak
err ada dua lah dua close friend okay err
bukan lah someone yang yang bersama-sama dengan kami sudah dalam business partner
tapi dia tetap seorang sahabat yang ada kadang-kadang sometime bila kita macam
contact dia minta nasihat ke apa ke walaupun saya memang marah lah dekat dia tetap lah orang yang beri impact kepada saya lah okay
first one jadi seorang yang lebih baik atau seorang yang pemarah ada dua kan the second one um
okay second one yang memang sentiasa kalau misal kata okay dia kalau dia ada masalah dia akan call
dia akan call akak tapi dia pun sedia untuk mendengar apa masalah kita
okay then last year is the first one yang akak cerita dengan dia after few years lah sudah berkawan kan
baru lah akak reveal dekat dia siapa yang bagi teratai akak rasa tahun lepas ya that one
akak reveal ah sedangkan orang bagi sudah teratai sejak tahun dua ribu sebelas
ah sudah sembilan tahun sudah waktu itu kawan err apa
yang kawan akak yang sudah ini kan yang sudah yang sudah pindah balik itu
err akak tanya okay okay memandangkan awak sudah tak ada kan okay ada satu benda yang ini nak bagi tahu okay so bagi tahu lah yang akak yang bagi teratai itu okay
um my parents err no I mean not err err macam
err macam sometime not in a good side but somehow
it turns to be a bad side juga okay uh so
greatest impact sebab greatest impact tak tahu apa benda ah okay soalan nombor sepuluh ida
okay ramai itu okay
ya lah family lah kan family mak ayah adik itu saja lah
third spend time the most ini boleh jadi orang yang kita call
yang paling nak akak cakap dengan top first
asnah lah itu tak dapat dinafikan itu memang top first lah
sudah okay next how did those five people influence you wow ambil engkau
yes so dia banyak bagi nasihat and so on lah
okay bagus bagus so itu lah yang paling most impact lah
okay so akak err
influence yang the first one is asnah
dia yang suggest sudah lama sudah dia memang suggest untuk akak pergi jumpa psychiatric
instead of counsellor ah sebab dia tak dia rasa it's not ini lah kan
and then after yang um
akak punya akak go talk dengan doctor doctor itu kan yang akak cakap dengan awak itu
and then after that akak decide memang akak tak nak go for university punya
akak go for memang professional punya field lah
and then um apa macam mana dia apa ini how impactful these five people ini
um tadi parents akak dan juga akak cakap pasal madrasah kan okay so madrasah yang akak pergi ini um
dia orang err most of them are refugees
okay and there is uh ada satu macam episode lah yang mana seorang budak ini dia
ganggu tau lembu dekat kawasan itu
orang kampung lah kata dia nampak okay but then um and then
macam pihak penguasaan madrasah ini macam marah lah and tampar budak itu depan mata akak
so itu akak rasa macam sudah lah you sudah lah dia refugees tahu dia memang
macam itu lah kan macam memang ya lah kita tak tahu negara dia dulu macam mana kan
memang ya lah mungkin dia orang bermasalah tapi dia dia orang adalah kanak-kanak yang ada perasaan
okay so issue nya adalah budak itu duduk tonggeng-tonggeng
punggung dekat orang kampung lah apa semua lepas itu main lepas itu macam
lepas itu err I talk to my dad lah waktu itu kan macam mm

so that this um apa ini
kita punya resolution untuk eh resolution
atas view of orchard tapi err in a budget hotel
I mean okay lah I mean considering dia punya apa tu space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite macam convenient and comfortable because macam very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because macam like you have to walk through the lorong and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that lah so macam I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like ah okay
I hate it oh my god macam like betul betul self-conscious sia oh my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare kalau like terglare and then you like oh no
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we datang selalu kan so
ya then you have to wait lah queue then wait for the aunty to like okay adik berapa orang okay dua orang duduk okay ah
adik also it's not abang okay it's adik cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know lah but he look I call him adik cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him ah adik nasi ayam dua I tell you it'll be so insulting
we'll be like adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with uh female punya shopkeeper yang macam fierce and garang right
nak apa dik nak apa huh makan lah dik semua tak nak
ya so macam like oh okay lah maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza sahaja so I think because you see eh the near nenek atau mak tak tahu lah dia punya atuk ke apa they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause dorang tahu macam orh ah nak pakcik ni cute ah macam like dia selalu smiling
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially kalau queue makanan kau sampai of course you want to cepat-cepat kasi habis pe
you mean angkat ayam merah oh ya
oh yang kat tepi err
mm I mean macam like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that tapi ah ya his diabetic punya reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends ah I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
he did this one going on for a couple of years what it's just that macam he only started yang exercise is much more rigorous because err he goes I mean he eventually found like kaki to you know run and all there and then you know lah people kat sana dorang selalu macam nak
buat apa tu compete siapa lari lagi banyak and all that ya
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby orang macam like oh they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends lah so it's always good to always
uh check whether you punya you know levels okay ke tak
it's very frustrating ah macam like especially for my brother-in-law cause dia dah yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so boleh naik pangkat
ya exactly but because doctor kata dia ada this certain levels you know that kind of thing so dia tak boleh ambil ah ya so he needs to be macam semua okay so that he can resume taking then lepas tu baru dia boleh considered for uh promotion
mm I mean like you will be wondering lah so I remember macam like on sangat kuruskan badan lah and all that because ya he's stuck there because like macam they said that oh because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted macam tu ah
not ya this is going to be a long period lah mana boleh overnight turn kau ni pun
so ya so um I mean I was telling lah maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I nak turunkan my eh my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
tak lah dia pergi doctor just untuk check dia punya apa tu blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with macam like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that main pun gila so aku marah dengan kakak
but just tauge because err okay
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like macam you want to be healthy then okay lor unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that tapi setakat macam nak like show off then ugh
I like apa tu make your own plans lah as
no more like my father is atas not us we're not there yet
apanya yang birch car punya skirt
oh okay okay uh yang baju lengan pendek tu ah okay okay
but now it's available kau tak nak beli
beli satu jer
mm mm it's really about whether or not um you nak better details but you need to take care of the material ataupun
and specifically macam like you do not have menses on that day
four or five pieces of clothing on depends ah sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait macam cause I beli tengah mid year sale atau end year sale
and then I will purposely go bila err towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many err options for me so I just make do with what's available lah
you know like okay lah boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana which explains my poor choices of clothing lately lah it's really makcik makcik bodoh but then
ada ada yang teruk lah aku macam terjujur juga
mm mm no but you must also always set aside something lah like for your self-care and all that tapi it's just with self-care fund that you dah set aside you have to really properly choose your battle lah macam like I nak pergi let's say lah pedi mani mani pedi ke lagi massage ke you know
um hair treatment ke so it's really macam you have to choose one of those macam ya
macam staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya tak boleh macam like I nak pergi staycay then lepas tu I nak buat kuku I I nak buat rambut I no no such thing ya
maintain lah bengok
no it's really about macam the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so technically kalau macam begitu
kalau macam begitu lah it really depends actually ya um you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya murah tak kesah asalkan okay lah you guna kan
kat ion yes
I mean if don't have also you can always pergi dengan
dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena inject kat uh spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
then itu lah naik Grab mm
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just uh call the hospital just to inform and then after that err tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting lah than daripada keep quiet call kena towed away you know we don't want that to happen
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there bodoh sia
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time eh motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak
mm mm so ya lah nak kena kena actually call or inform at least just to check
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before tapi
no never because I think because of location macam
ya so far so tak tak hairan lah
ya lah that was even later you know that was in october ya so the paling recent pun
ya can you imagine oh my god letak the kids at home I need to get them out
no lah because you have to book in cause you just you just got the vouchers right so you can only book macam only now lah recently sebelum ni tak boleh book in advance
ya ya ya staycay is that one lah that one is a given itu ada book err quite early
tapi macam like
ya lah new year pun expensive lah mana mana expensive seh cause nak step tengok fireworks ah and all that
can you imagine you stay here then kau nampak kat hujung there's fireworks okay ah
eh but if you have new year's eve kat sini then you look out quite nice eh
oh okay okay tahu tahu a'ah tahu tahu okay okay
mahal gila mahal gila I mean dia macam chalet eh ke apa ni
resort lah macam itu
ee boring nya
now just lebih mahal sia
nak beratur still mahal satu malam
ya but at least kau turun pun banyak barang kau boleh buat apa
I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain kat sana tengok momok
ya the thing is kadang kala how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean kalau nak kata kan pulau ubin okay lah eh but you you don't need a passport for that tapi I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon ah maybe like macam pertengahan twenty twenty one
I entah lah aku mana tahu
they delayed because err tiba-tiba ada the spike in the number of cases ah
and sketchy sekarang
I think macam I think kat thailand macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk would be macam kat um malaysia
because I think number of cases so far yang dorang report kat news thailand macam tak ada jer
mean ada yang tempat rural ke
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right bodoh
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay lah kasut kau orang lah I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any err medical attention if they ever get COVID
all over the country oh bagus lah good job
mm mm mm mm tengok jer lah
how sure are you there are the same group of people mungkin tak lah ada tapi segelintir
daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni then you like ah korang minta kena sepak
ya you know that time dekat asia one kan tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam train tak pakai mask bodoh betul
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador atau the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like kadang-kadang orang singapore ini kan dorang banyak complain banyak ambil gambar banyak submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
ada lah segelintir
no dia kena saman lazarus island pun sama semua kena saman
I feel like you kalau jail yang perempuan yang kata mana tak
ya that one she does it she did it repeatedly kalau you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time tak serik second time tak serik
ya lah but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone lah like got the first time okay kalau kau buat lagi then that's it kau minta kena sepak you know that kind of thing
apa dia we have what
no the thing is adela they have different arrangement adela so macam like offices right now right they said ah cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that macam
kan begini ah seh
khatib khatib kat mana ni
oh kat yishun itu
oh yang ah ya ya I wanted to ask him mana then I I saw HomeTeam
panjat panjat panjat then lepas tu
but ada lah I've been avoiding arrows so much
alah kesian
maybe should just put disclaimer I'm really nice please don't take my niceness wrongly you know macam cerita a walk to remember please don't fall in love with me
oh ya that's true dorang just bengat gila sia
yes ke bedek ah you know like ah
aww awak ambil berat tentang saya ke oh alah comelnya naik nombor boleh ah pergi mampus lah
ku baik salah ku tak baik salah semua adiknya pergi mampus lah
I think no lah maybe just because like I don't know maybe dorang main game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to macam vent you know dekat rumah you know that kind of thing
okay jer lah aku dah biasa benda begini
like ya like I even have my favourite buaya at uh
no lah because you know kat malaysia kan ada satu video ni the mum ke the father ask the the child bunyi ayam macam mana bunyi kucing macam mana bunyi itik macam mana
I tak tahu and then bunyi buaya macam mana the bunyi buaya is hi sayang
ya so what I mean my favourite buaya is I have this one player who always use the same line on me every single time we play
so I was like eh buaya favourite I and then he's like hi sayang still bisik-bisik nak tidur kan ah macam mana you tahu
I'll be like pergi mampus boleh ya
uh ya usually do that in the presence of other guys then they'll be like kau yang buaya lah sia
tak tahu lah aku malas layan tu kalau dorang mengamuk tu antara bini dengan dia bukan aku nya pasal
alah kesian
kan you main game lah belajar lah main game
I mean nak kena ada schedule lah like okay my previous clan right err
they they are they are they are all muslim married and they have children and all that so what they do is uh they they actually actually agreed with their wife tahu macam okay I will settle everything I will take care of the kids you know homework and all that but then I will play I will have my playing time from nine thirty onwards
is is is is surprising because you know why pasal mereka berbual dalam telephone kan eh dalam game okay abang dah habis ngaji bang okay sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur eh
adik adik macam mana adik homework dah habis ke dik okay kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah check nanti adik boleh tidur
so it's normal lah I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know err really manage time and all that tapi ada tak tahu lah yang macam bengap semacam
I mean like there are a few macam like shirk responsibility sanggup balik rumah lambat and all that pasal nak main game kat luar
tak tahu mana aku tahu but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought dia belum kahwin tahu because uh my that time my friend was like kau dekat rumah bujang uh uh then I was like rumah bujang then after that I ask my friend then I said rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck tapi dorang mana rumah flat kat situ kan so is macam like those
pondok-pondok like kosong like people rest
mm mm macam itu lah along the road ada satu err so that's what they call rumah bujang lah
tak tak tepi road lah tapi ah correct ya ya correct ah ah ah lah sial
then aku aku macam cause nanti dia macam like okay aku nak balik
eh kat mana ni sekarang
eh lawa kat rumah bujang ni then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group ah the lobby right
dia tanya kau orang eh
uh rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya you know macam like macam like okay rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke and then he's like tak tahu lah you tanya dia sendiri
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person lah I said asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri err dia kata kat rumah dia punya internet tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ
fair enough because like macam awak that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the hutan
ya so I'm like okay lah fair enough lah desak kau kau buat apa kau nak
ya lah data pun tak boleh
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research tak bagus data pun tak bagus
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's kat itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite macam low to medium right depending ah
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos lah lepas alah
kan macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil
ya ya I do that tapi nak kena ada portable charger lah or maybe mm mm mm
tapi kalau macam like err either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
mm mm betul betul
it's literally macam cucuk selah
apa pasal aku berdarah sia kat bawah
like I feel like I fell like macam I be right again
so macam lepas tu aku pergi toilet kan I kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah I was like
takut bilang kau that time
akunya akunya benda baik balik bodoh
is because it's really macam masuk then dia pakai macam clamp sakit bodoh
kau belum kena lagi kan berbual banyak huh
they do put the benda macam gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that cuma like the initial part a bit painful lah
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the cepat and you get the result on the spot also
ah kalau ada fibroid ke tak so buat buat sekali lah and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like macam like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like begini sudah beranak dua no I said no I said I said dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising and then when I kena
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya then she's like baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan
ada ambil ah
eh but then when I was at the clinic ini kan it's so awkward
because semua orang datang dengan dorang punya partner I went there alone
tak tahu apa nak buat kesian like husband pandai buat you know that kind of thing
bila nak penetrate semua nak ya bodohnya jantan
ya depan belakang tak boleh okay pusat pun boleh
ya air air I also quite a number of people lah you know people in who had late pregnancies then I see teenagers with their mum it's so it's quite sad actually
like I pretend macam dengar music daripada hal
tak nampak pregnant ah tapi dia macam nangis lah but I wanted to tell the mum like you're doing a great job ya
unless ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia lah
mmhmm lepas beranak ah mm mm
macam like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not aduh what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about macam how to have sex responsibly or safely
pakai tu lah saran wrap
ya because err err kadang-kadang you know before when they did that ligation right maybe an egg has already been released
what did I bring ah nasi
ya but I didn't panaskan though because I so lazy to panaskan

okay um I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya shopping ke I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya work ke nak dengar pasal kak alin punya wedding
tapi one of the macam
tapi no lah I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something lah for my bags or something
because I remember reading before dia orang kata can just keep
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips dekat dia orang punya zips covered kan in in like its original packaging kita tak buka so it's all just there abeh kita takut ah okay so I thought was safe
abeh I followed his wife macam a luxury person lah okay on instagram abeh dia ada macam Q&A session gitu sometimes abeh dia punya one of dia punya itu is um don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime abeh if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then um the humidity and also whatever whatever
ya so so I'm worried about it tapi kalau if I ask him to keluarkan
then tak oh my god tapi that time itu saya tengah because saya beli banyak benda kan then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because kakak dia belum keluarkan her clothes
so in that so ada a small section where I can put the stuff lah abeh
you know bila macam nak unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag ah macam all nice gitu kan so woohoo open it up
then tak enough space tau so long as it can I can you gerakkan your tempat baju sikit so that I can more space lepas itu dia how why you just taruh dekat atas lah then no nanti crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is kalau kak suruh dia like can you keluarkan this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
nanti dia just macam campak or whatever nanti semua like I don't know nanti macam crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why macam oh if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now kak punya kerja like
just nak duduk rumah ya
um because now dia apple boy he got a macbook
then when your contract ends kita sama tak mine is on february
tapi yours is the same kita sama plan kan ada abah
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think dia punya pun end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone ah
ya then macam all the other laptops macam will
ah then macam not bad ah then like ya macam
macam all the food that abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai seh
then dia okay lah then dia ya
no I just thought macam
I tak tahu I tahu macam when I hear macam the oh the android versus apple whatever macam android punya argument macam their specs is better
and like sea creams like sea cream pastels and dia macam you know that marshmallow and macam round gitu swirly gitu it literally looks at that considering the pathway is not
ah macam film theory
kan film theory on youtube kau dah tengok I feel like ada
I tak tahu fashion so back to the basic
ya cause I tak adventurous so saya tak adventurous
saya takut stick out
okay saya tak tahu ring so
the vibes eh the vibes get a little vaccine also hello it's just it's just tampal there anyway
aku tak tahu period aesthetic tau aesthetic kita tak ada the third eye aesthetic close
kita tak ada vibes kak ada I would say um FOMO
ah ah macam oh she looks nice let me copy that look
I have macam oh okay I like this I don't like that outfit ada lah but macam
it's not like oh I the whole genre of that outfit I suka
ya lah academia lah macam sweater um with like pleats and like straight cut pants
you know kak benda semua dekat my table black and pink
oh so kak limah macam on that scale kak limah macam on a six
I'm fine with that tapi dia end up with um macam best so been tested
um he's kinda like dia just not a nice guy
I don't remember if dia ada err actually I do I don't remember if dia ada err apa macam character change plot whatever what is it called ya character development I don't remember
ya macam huh asal dia ini ya actually all the guys in gossip girl boo humphrey boo they just macam oh oh it's me okay I don't fit in macam okay relax
zero number first affordable need archie bol something like that okay I get it macam kau kaya okay archipelago I teller I david archuleta
weird but no archuleta is doesn't he doesn't even sound macam atas
archie bol dia how to spell archie B O L oh
he's like in the upper class you know cause ya tak humphrey macam humpty dumpty you know he's in the dumps period serena serena van der would said okay she has she has european blood line okay
I mean I'm sure macam small characters lah but the main cast their white
dia macam oh my god brooklyn dekat a part of new york
so macam school high school ya dekat ya the show started dia orang high school that means it's high school season so by the time case dia orang dah kerja dia orang dah kerja some of them kahwin so
dah kahwin dah ah si chuck bass kahwin si blair waldorf si selena kahwin si dan ah I tahu dan lah he main the netflix you know the you the stalker that's dan and then selena is siapa nama selena eh
blake lively selena william selena wiliam sejak bila nak sama tak oh tersay then blair waldorf selena booked dia the waldorf brown hair ah siapa
there's two the main character I would say two girls and three guys two girls three guys ther's one more girl tapi dia macam I think
I was like tak salah lah at the end dia macam
um I at the actress some something and then dia macam tak so so present either like ending last season something like that the actress herself macam problematic something like like that lah dia macam dia macam indecisive punk life then dia macam I think so lah there were some like drama whatever contract tak ingat ah something something but
kalau if I remember correctly she wasn't macam so
I tak tahu I tak tahu dia nak pursue music something like that she had a rock band and that no she's blonde she's like super like platinum blonde and tapi dia ada pakai like eyeliner macam wow macam black the character also not nice
towards the end agaknya lah ya
anyway dia dan punya adik in the show
so there's three guys and then ya I think the two guys if I say the name you don't know who ya because dia orang after gossip girl dia orang tak so popular
no itu
skaters pretty liars ah no pretty liars tak ada boys actually ada boys but dia orang macam not
maybe I don't even know what the guys look like ada ada boys but dia orang macam not so
aria aria the rambut macam besar gila kan

ya lah I mean daripada kau tak ada kerja then um kau just want to get a
kau went over and ask for apa yang tu err
apa yang kau pergi minta err bidan then dia orang bilang engkau suruh ambil err hairdressing kan
to think balik
you know at least kau sudah
walaupun macam kau think balik now now kau think balik err whatever that kau err going through
before kau tak ada kerja and then kau tengah
kau dapat that skills err future now kau sudah ada that that sudah ada that skill the only thing kau want to progress
but um do you think macam you have gone you think kau sudah pergi quite far juga eh
berapa tahun eh semua kau dah berapa tahun agak-agak kau ah gunting eh
oh semua ini satu tahun saja
oh daripada two thousand and nineteen
tapi kau suka juga ke I mean sekarang ni kau dah come to a point yang macam kau
find it macam dah terlalu err repetitive ah kan
mm habis kalau kau
if you are given a chance untuk um
sound engineer atau gunting rambut
eh the other day kau pergi err airport
dengan anak kau eh semua birthday eh
oh oh she went out dengan your folk your folk ah
kau kau ada ini tak bagi tahu dia yang err aku send regards
I see all good brother pasal ya ya lah I mean budak budak kecil right they
ya I I think kau punya anak quite err pintar eh
macam quite intelligent eh
macam ya lah kecil habis err
degil which is kan bagus ah ke tak degil degil dia ke tak
ada lah ada that's err it's been quite awhile man
it's been quite awhile geng pasal ya um
err you know lah pasal
COVID you know err I think the last one kita met was probably before
COVID right it was uh kau datang sini um
the recording yang aku nak nak minta kau tolong untuk aku pergi
is there anymore yang kau datang rehearsal is there any rehearsal
mm lama ah about diam tak diam dah
ah dah enam bulan ah
so ya tapi dah oh no dengan ayah tu is probably when uh farhan ah
kita nak work on lagu farhan ya
aku kind of tengah
tak ada tak ada majority things yang come to aku punya err aku punya life
I've now baru start main bicycle err aku baru beli bicycle err a cruiser
err aku just pergi cruising around dengan family aku
err other than that aku rasa aku working on some project macam
aku been doing a lot of err things kat
err nothing fantastic yang aku rasa tengah going on
which is err ah tapi
aku rasa tenang ah macam biasa ah
tenang ah so more more of and more more upcoming projects
yang akan kami you know macam
but paling boring is err tak dapat pergi err seberang tambak ah
itu yang paling boring ah pada aku for the past six months ini
sebab member member yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga
ah aku suppose I think err I think err dia bukan
ah maybe maybe betul pada kau macam in thing sebab semua orang
but the point is sebab tak ada
tak ada activity yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is juga
it's the best time untuk nak explore and then kita are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration yang
it will stop orang kata macam
I mean time sekolah kita kan dulu explore kat bawah block lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh
err main
main tangkap spider at some point of time kan kita orang dah malas buat benda ni because kita nak kerja
so when kita dah kerja probably kita jumpa somebody
err bila mm jumpa kawan
ah nonsense buat nonsense nonsense punya barang then
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
jadi mungkin aku rasa that's the best time untuk um beriadah ah
untuk just do leisure out of
kau punya own comfort zone jadi this is the best time untuk kau come back to kau punya
err youth balik ke
you know where kau kau missing out
ah and aku rasa it's a good good good thing juga with this um
aku rasa kita will tend to macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita itself
ada this tempat ada that tempat ada
then kita pun tahu yang macam okay kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat right now apart from just makan
kita start to do cycling will start to explore macam
um tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi before
ah so aku rasa
it's good juga ah
but err kalau kau cakap about that is the the the in thing right now
but not just aku rasa ada orang pun buat not just err cycling tahu
but randomly but now is macam semua orang dah start to macam even
uh explore our own country punya whatever yang ada kat dalam ah not just bab makan jer
ya I mean yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang it's definitely
at this point of time tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang
tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi
but if there if there are thing macam tu aku rasa there will be possibilities pun pasal
pasal it's not macam something yang apa
something yang err
normal but aku rasa
might never know longkang tu pergi mana sekarang semua orang banyak go on the tahu
macam kira park connector punya
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku ah
yes and it was actually pada aku macam
oh and then kau tak kau tak nak explore right macam
so dude during that that that exploration tu
err aku from hougang going to bukit batok um go through macam
and you err you wouldn't you wouldn't realize ya macam
the park connectors are macam really boleh bawa kau macam daripada um
or daripada wherever daripada sini pun daripada
all the way boleh sampai ke clarke quay
clarke quay all the down all the way sampai dekat queenstown
from queenstown keluar pergi dekat buona vista
from buona vista all the way pergi bukit batok how's ah
going from the east side aku tak tahu there are such a thing macam itu tak
ah was it macam dah start dekat uh east area boleh kau realize tak
okay tak
I mean kau kau dah pergi ah juga tu ke ataupun kau
pass by ke kau jogging ke tak ataupun kau nampak jer
oh so sudah sudah kau sudah use that lah dekat
then daripada daripada uh
tampines to bedok ada you think
for now kau dah nampak yang tampines to pasir ris
hougang betul tak baru dia come dia come in right
look at that macam
eh kau err ini hari tak buat apa-apa ke sia
macam apa selalu kau buat on saturday
when you were in your mid twenties gitu
mm dia orang you know they they they they they even like
like now kan macam
go back in time tak
kau tak nak tak suka pergi east coast
kau rasa kau ada kau rasa kau ada penyakit tak with that
tak ah I mean aku cakap dengan kau pasal there are some people who
tak mandi err would would find themselves
it's actually bukan rabak ah punya penyakit it's just that something yang
yang penyakit yang tak familiar ah but you have that you know
huh it's not it's not a bad punya ini lah maksud aku macam kadang-kadang kan macam
ada orang uh tak boleh main dekat
err tak boleh main dekat rumput
ada so itu penyakit
mungkin pada kau it's something yang
macam orang tak familiar macam mungkin pada kau orang rasa kau macam leceh
tapi sebenarnya it's um
bukan pasal tu it's actually memang
it will affect kau punya
mood it will affect kau punya the the the
day yang kau bangun the next day it will affect macam
kau rasa um
ya it's as good as macam kau
might have a macam a feeling yang macam can occur sampai err
tak sedap ah you know tak sedap badan
tak lah tak lah pasal aku aku just wonder lah pasal kadang-kadang kan kenapa aku cakap east coast kan randomly juga pasal kan
err ya lah all this tempat or all this
things yang kita buat ni kan semua macam relate to apa yang aku dengan kau
boleh buat macam east coast was probably buat lagu
cause I guess macam tenang
tapi macam kadang-kadang um tenang but
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
kalau tak ada kereta um
then nak patah balik nak tidur you know macam you know
pagi pagi jer dah sian macam kira sudah pukul
pukul tiga pukul empat atau especially when the
sun is macam really on top of us memang take it will be like macam
ya kau
it was really it was really macam pain lah tapi kalau
kalau ada kenderaan you know um senang sikit kan
macam ataupun macam tak overnight lah you know grab or what not
so ya lah and yang macam
all these benda benda yang macam um
err exploration ini semua kan macam as kita grow
like aku rasa ini semua macam
things yang uh a cycle eh
kita cakap right now is like kau going to almost
err reaching kau punya four digits
ya aku sudah aku sudah forty ya
habis yang yang baru-baru ni semua kira time dekat COVID tu
kau just stay rumah ke ke kau ada cabut juga pergi mana-mana
kau takut tak time yang lockdown
pernah ada kau pernah ada sampai itu mentality tak
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
um went up to kau punya house ketuk ketuk ketuk ketuk macam zombie eh kita cakap macam
macam that kind ah lepas tu sekali macam
macam eh eh eh eh eh
open ah lepas tu macam eh
boy ah open ah itu macam that kind of thing ah
but this was before yang the first phase was the one yang
tak ada chance untuk keluar pun kan
kan that first few weeks kan at least a month tak keluar kan
so this phase two yang that one month tu
tak kan yang kedai-kedai gunting pun
yes and then ada phase two right
ya so this was macam the first
first few days yang when dia orang announce tak boleh keluar
ah aku was having so much err banyak banyak um
kind of macam err slowly slowly became macam
dalam diam aku did a lot of shopping you know macam
macam online shopping which is aku never that did did that before ah but I really did ah
and then ya it was really macam
like any other day any other day it was just macam two dollar punya shopee
three dollar punya stuff and then every
like every two three days mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku eh
but ya lah it was really funny that aku err ada that phase ah
because aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat eh
mm I mean being apa yang engkau nak buat
and then kita orang tak ada that that that that
tanah lapang you know we don't have a big um
kalau kau nak pergi luar to check people out pun macam
aku rasa that that experience was really macam best untuk aku ah
and then because aku pun ada at some point of time
err during that circuit time pun aku hantar
aku punya aku punya senior aku punya dad dekat hospital jadi
aku saw how the street are lonely
phase one is when everybody macam really macam
sudah come back to macam you know
I think yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka
during err apa err
during err circuit breaker punya time pun I think um
I did walk around lah macam pergi mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing ah macam
it was really macam almost to
almost to macam
being in the eighties balik where there is not much people around
but at the same time pun macam lonely juga
because kita pun will be hide inside
you know macam it's okay if you're younger
semua benda boleh boleh change kalau tak betul-betul you can change you punya
crazy also juga kan
so ya lah but still pun
ah the effect and I just macam for the
tak tahu how it will go on lah but I guess
this is one part of our life yang kita jumpa ah you know
it might happen again or it might happen again but lagi more ah
kerja ah it's not no work you know affected
aku rasa it's err more of err
tapi it's not the war of bombing lah gitu
it's macam um
macam um
it's macam
a smooth war ah you know a smooth war that macam
kita tak boleh expect that you know
kita tak boleh expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone macam
tak ada kerja or probably macam
where everyone was really macam
kerja atau tak kerja lah
ah but now is macam
or the environment macam play err err
make them to kind of macam stop from
oh itu lah itu lah um
aku pun macam kira macam wow after all these years err
I I was having a conversation the other day balik pada macam
ah you know macam err you know talking about
music in general macam macam err the whole world right now is err having
or the whole creative punya line in the whole wide world is um
habis aku was just err bagi tahu
err deedee the other day a friend of kau tahu deedee lah kan
so aku bagi tahu deedee about macam you know the rest of the world
um especially macam dekat and what not
dia orang punya creative was kind of macam stopped right now
kita orang was that macam kita orang tak ada industry and kita orang nak kena stop juga
so macam you get what I mean it's like macam um
macam ya lah
but kita orang kind of tak ada industry
pun nak kena stop juga sama macam dia orang
and lagi teruk
ya I mean but what lucky enough juga what if kalau kau dah baru graduate
kau baru graduate last year probably baru nak start kerja dah
you know but now lucky enough macam kau ada time untuk breather you know a bit breather and
you can have time untuk
apa kau nak buat ready untuk next you know
because right now also everything macam kau was talking about
uh all this macam kerja dekat dalam studio
and you know right now everyone was really macam
mm really macam
ya lah tak tak boleh go out for
for in the studio pun kalau tak betul-betul
and even now the studio are all not operating pun
ya it's like the same thing like what happened dekat ini juga
crazy times juga
youtube just used whatever content you know macam
ya semua orang macam
anyhow ah kira macam sembarang ah kira uh it's ya
and even macam sekarang ini macam netflix and there are big big err
but how they going to use all these macam despite of time
you know macam how can they macam selit how can they like you know err
aku I'm very sure there will be there will be light somewhere
it's just that macam
aku rasa don't don't don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you tak macam
but the thing is take it as if macam there's a new skill yang kau belajar
like also kau kena ingat juga since kau cakap video dah ada
aku rasa you should share it ah you know macam
the other side will be like uh oh no I want this one ah eh you cannot I plan already mah so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think eh want to get married it's not going to be uh sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later lah nanti dulu berbual so sekarang kita go dulu then kalau later part then we can plan lepas tu buat plan K uh getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house mah
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like macam you know lah to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see
yang kat mana where at where
why because it really trigger my nerve you know what when you want to do kad jemputan it's a wedding card ah eh so when want to do kad jemputan it's like
tak ya
that guy flew it's very uh macam yang macam dia dah enal lama ah but alhamdulillah macam he can talk to me we are not awkward all the time ya that's the that's the best part of him ah there are also not not like uh apa uh retrovert eh
in okay so I was not like macam pendiam or what something like that so
I talk to him macam
macam dah kenal lama ah ya correct that guy is is is is cool
that guy is cool very very cheerful funny guy ya better than I think that's better than our last time yang yang supposed to be there right ya
we are maybe kita nak buat lagi ah
I think better we do because maybe that time macam tak prepare and by the way yang pasal kahwin ni video ni ya of course but we can make it one more round just for a video of us lah better kan
ada kat google my I think I'm my punya google photo ada berapa banyak gambar kita all this you can make it uh as a oh ya ya ya yes
the wedding eh okay the wedding regret tak pasal I as a guy guy's side eh wedding is just dia macam slide tau
they have no bumpy ride you know no need to engage gear apa gear sekarang we just like cukup time habis kita tak ada macam apa eh eh uh kita punya tanjak okay tak kita punya keris senget tak tak ada tak ada tak ada we don't we just cukup time
halal that is what I want dia tak ada macam eh
kasut kasut ketat tak tak ada tak ada tak ada I don't I don't I don't have think of that cause that time for
tak payah fikir sangat ya
the best part dia punya hari tak hujan tu jer for me it's the weather ah for me for it uh dia punya for me is the weather I cuaca dia yes correct
macam dia tak susah nak dapat tu weather that time out of what january eh month of january right dia dia macam tak nak kata panas tak boleh tau pasal I'm very stable outdoor tau dia kat luar
uh okay tempat dia okay just under void deck juga kan uh kita ambil kat void deck kita book void deck so kita plan nak booking void deck malaysia dia tak ada ada ada orang book kan they're taking up other events something like that it's very dia punya port dah okay tau so one thing's uh kita dah book then apa lagi
about the ada ada water utilities right you have to go something like that and everything uh under under that lah so make sure yang siapa yang nak kahwin uh kat you know void deck ke apa kan make sure you do your planning well I'm talking about the place ah ya
kan oh really kenapa eh
kenapa eh
for how many pack berapa orang dia eh okay
oh macam the brides woman jadi batman eh
mm lima puluh eh oh tak I think dua
three tiga tu tiga oh tiga eh uh first mm
slow down the process macam macam mana
maybe along the way they boleh buat photoshoot kan dalam kereta ke apa something like that tak eh
selit sikit lah tak ada selit
oh why kenapa
actually yang pasal your makcik tu dia memang cari pasal lah ya correct why why kenapa dia buat kenapa dia nak cakap macam tu kat depan mak you kan habis what your mum apa ada dua anak jer patut kena cakap balik
oh apa asal ha a bit
okay wedding eh kena uh nak uh apa uh dia dengan kompang tu
kan that time wow that time I macam ada crusader datang tapi tu semua dah plan lah so I cannot use my proceed kompang macam macam lain-lain team pula kalau tak I smile I tak ada uh plan but it goes well
sometimes it doesn't plan well it doesn't plan before but it goes well so it's like it's like macam cool lah eh tak tak
tak cakap pun ni semua jadi sendiri eh I was like happy ah my brother was there uh my adik was there with me dia dia yang plan macam mana dia punya line up so I was uh wow that's my first time tau I tak macam prepare all this eh asal my brother know ah ah that time ya brothers are quite okay lah my best man there that time
okay so uh kompang the the luckiest I mean the best part is the kompang weather and I also uh when I came to the pelamin then I saw you there sitting
then uh that's where I meet my wife and mak andam dia cover muka dia everything like that something like that tapi ada ada hadang eh
quite fun lah but that time tak ada macam rabak punya pakai apa uh padlock ke apa nak pecahkan kunci tak ada ah but just that dia very straightforward yes
and dapat tahu siapa more yang I dah kenal kenal lah yang tak kenal tu uh kat sana baru kenal tahu macam eh quite cool juga eh I mean of course the yang paling bising pun ada
of course they are part I think I think I think your family side is the loudest and have had have more uh fun there ah quite lucky you know actually it's throughout is the families getting to know each other I mean mak dia also apa welcoming me as a new guy in the family ya
tapi kita tak boleh buat like second round dua round tiga round tak boleh the best part
talking about the ballroom let's say ah you want to go to the what orange ballroom kita tak boleh makan ke
dah jalan dah kahwin if can rewind something like that ya
okay I first thing is sad one thing is happy okay the sad part the the wedding is over and it turn actually it turn out well lah okay and dia tak ada macam problem macam power trip ke apa tak ada it just went well so the event
dah habis kan so kita dah
dah apa dah stand down everything then
not say happy but I'm very like macam uh conscious ah what where to step everything it's not like macam wah this another episode it must be a difficulty at anywhere and at any corner will come
so what I'm I'm telling myself okay so kita then I think banyak tengok movie ah or drama orang-orang kahwin semua macam ni everything macam mana how dia dia dia plan dia rely on everything so nak recalled that back dia then kena ikut cerita apa dah jadi movie or drama dia jadi you know but I want to be my own drama
I want to be my own so I cannot tell them eh apa nak buat next ah siapa nak tanya my father or my mother or wherever yang dah pernah kahwin eh apa nak buat next ah it's like kental ah so I'm a man now I don't care so now you got own you got own way so you have it's a fun life ah
whether you what you want it to be so you nak macam mana you just create yourself until now I'm still creating so as a husband I as a husband
I'm talking for myself right uh I want to be very thrill I mean not really straight ah kadang-kadang corner a bit so you know ah you know the road well dia tak ada macam uh always straight jer ada ya lah kadang-kadang kita straight pun
boring apa straight road mesti ada corner left a bit sharp turn all these ah play along lah so how you handle okay first thing
uh that is me I cannot handle my wife if you if you can't handle me what I mean myself so this what I'm trying to say that kita if you handle myself unless you can handle anyone else so it's like that
so dah kahwin then uh ya then I rest at home
okay then don't play play anymore tak boleh macam berfoya-foya something like macam uh go anyhow and then I ask permission for my wife pasal kita dah kahwin sekarang kita tak boleh macam hanky-panky dulu bujang lain tak apa
we lepak bawah bawah block apa semua mak mak tak kisah so mak abah semua tak ali bila nak balik uh kau layan phone jer sekarang kalau wife lain tau dia tanya on the spot nak kena respond
dua missed call game
kiranya macam you're asking for trouble lah I know something will break or what itu eh wife punya side but dulu tak ah so this what is a discipline ah so you have to be more not say matured more discipline and care your wife be accompany with her so that everything goes well actually when I think ah
the more I care about my wife eh the more things I get you know like macam you there's something you return well lah something you don't know what is that but something you return you return well just nicely macam tak cakap dia dah fikir dulu tau ah something like that something like that if you if you think that way ah for me lah now right now that's one thing I like about her
if you give in she will also give back so fair lah ah for me it's fair if you now I don't have any like lepak dengan kawan tau dia tak macam call turun lepak lima lima empat pagi unless work lah unless work tu pun nasib dia punya
so ada lah sikit
uh not dia tak sama tapi serupa lah okay so pasal uh travelling eh okay start from travelling okay I as in start from our honeymoon lah the that is the starting of we how we can be linked
so there's no other dia tak ada pergi tempat lain tau macam long distance that time nak go mana ah pergi mana cambodia eh huh that time was the last time so I don't know that passport dah habis pasal I not a travelling guy
so bila part nak pergi honeymoon tu I using that passport lah yang lama tu then sampai airport
that time I thought my wife eh then kita baru kahwin kan so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
dia tak marah dia just cakap aja alamak it's just I know that she's very disappointed you know
tapi dia tak expose dia punya marah tu kat airport so we plan that was macam I literally divert tau pergi malaysia
and then at malaysia passport I my passport lepas so dia kata can pass through ah my wife pergi book every yang mana yang nak pergi so that part eh she really a hardcore dia boleh book
so kita pergi mana dulu ah cameron highland first baru drop to cameron highland and port dickson so meaning we go three places lah eh under under malaysia state
I quite weird we having fun there lah it took part it's not it's not about malaysia you know it's the how we make that happen until now that's the best somehow eh kita nak pergi ah somewhere like macam uh korea ke itu kita plan apa kita nak plan plan plan sampai pergi tapi ini tak tau dia nak pergi bandung dulu nak pergi bandung then airport uh then passport dia habis uh mati then lepas tu kita dapat tahu kita pergi tempat lain and that was not planned
mm so kita ramp
that time so I have to drive lah so then I think my wife my wife should realise lah until now eh I'm a good driver not punishment it's just that dia tahu tau eh my husband can you know something not something fall
someone can can bring up back macam I tak cakap eh awak I cannot drive lah malam ni
no no no no I will fork out I will fork out something you've resolved eh macam
masuk mati ke I've tried to make something better lah so that's why my driving skill come in about that time dia dah I dah drive dah berapa kali ah eh
so I got you're saying that I I I I got uh someone that yang macam
travels dengan parents tak ada boyfriend ya you see eh you can hear that or not tak ada boyfriend that will make I'm the guy okay so
so something lesson learned lah sometime kalau kita pergi bandung pun it's a one way trip dia tak pergi mana-mana tempat pun whereas kalau kat malaysia ni kita pergi macam
a few places lah banyak oh ada juga eh oh
by okay by the way kan uh insyaallah kalau abang you ada duduk sana all right
dia punya menyesal tu takde lah
pasal I I choose this what
so how you can say regret no no no no not not really lah if something like macam benda yang eh kalau tahu buat ni takde takde it just went well if I plan if I say that now
if I know I being I do that now macam sekarang kan baru nak menyesal then we're going backward
so tu yang best lah macam
marriage sekarang ni ke apa oh okay
of course kan masa tu berselerak lah
I I scared I takut bila kalau my wife dia
uh suruh buat ni suruh buat tu uh tak boleh tidur rumah I tak tengok mak I something like that lah kena very like macam doesn't goes well lah once ada ah I don't like kadang-kadang kan ada orang kahwin dia straightaway eh
kat dia punya in-law jer
I don't know mungkin dia takde can nak tengok adik sendiri for me I I don't have that my wife give me freedom to go play especially
see my wife jalan-jalan makan dengan dia orang semua ya my wife is very fair very fair so we have this uh fairness lah ha so vice versa if for me kalau apa yang dia buat tu tak salah kan dalam segi undang-undang and dengan undang-undang agama then why not just try lah so try something new cause dia try something new ni kadang-kadang dia tak boleh macam
macam lama punya style jer so kita nak kena understand kita dah apa dah zaman ni sekarang kan zaman sekarang ni kita
a lot of things all or way we can uh do business ke apa ke so you have to try it out
bersyukur sekarang ni dah dia punya takde macam apa selisih faham lah
try to be more okay dia I think ah okay my wife dia nak ambil lesen tau okay I know this lesson we will take one or two years maybe or months only but
kalau dia drive tu I think she can bring me anywhere lah might be it's her turn after five years I bring eh another five years is her turn lah
dia punya turn so hopefully kalau dia dapat drive kan untuk suami suami dia ni yang very cute ni also cute you know I'm very cute also and of course ah ya so hopefully that's my request mah and drive me anywhere
I like I like her cooking until now no failure especially my recipes I just left my recipes recently there's I just finish ah so she cook for me every night shift so that's the best part day shift pun sama yes
I like her cooking actually uh she can cook well better than me ah that part I cannot take ah they cannot part they cannot challenge thank you sayang
oh sekejap jer kan rasa dah dua ribu dua puluh satu dah
kan dia macam january february march december terus
tu ah
target berapa target
wow eh tapi kan khairul aming buat kan fifteen dua bulan tau ah tak dia memang dia memang makan sihat eat clean and he did skipping like for every day
ah but memang kak long vegetarian kot of course you can do it
mm menarik menarik
of course I have a lot tapi kita kena prioritise lah kan mana yang for this year and nanti next next year kita buat lagi yang lain kan
okay before this rasa boleh survive lima ratus sebulan sekarang gaji pun tak cukup untuk survive bulan-bulan so plan resolution untuk dua ribu dua puluh satu adalah untuk
mm make my own business uh untuk for side income lah part time lah part time for fun
mm ada two things actually which is dah started dah pun ah macam tu tapi kita
kita slow slow lah menapak kita punya business kan first uh untuk buat surprise delivery
sebenarnya kan nak buat surprise delivery ni I tak rasa pun nak buat
dia bukannya more to untuk duit tau it is just that I feel happy to see people happy
faham ke ha macam pergi delivery pergi pergi buat delivery kat orang nanti orang tu surprise eh dapat happy dapat surprise gitu kan macam seronoknya macam tu lah lagi satu the
the other part yang best sebab selepas delivery ini adalah bila kita
pack surprise tu kan so kalau orang tu order nak ni ni ni kita pack dia punya surprise box tu kan bila pack tu rasa macam
uh we pour love in that box faham ke
boleh customise lah sebab kita tak nak macam idea macam mana eh kita nak every gift tu comes with thought
orang tu sendiri fikir dia nak bagi hadiah apa bukannya dia dia bagi bulat-bulat kat kita oh okay uh I nak set A dah let's say macam tu kan which is set A dia memang kita dah provide
then it dia macam tak comes from heart truly tau ha
ha kita macam gift creator lah macam tu
everything is possible apa jer orang tu nak kita akan make it happen kan
end of november tahun lepas kot start
ah ada dua customer and more to come
hmm betul
then satu bila macam selalunya kita surprise delivery orang yang order surprise delivery ni orang yang tak boleh nak pergi hantar sendiri
so dia part oh part yang orang tu pergi hantar part tu dah tak ada tau untuk orang tu bagi dekat but macam nice ah kita nak bagi kat orang kan
so part yang kita pergi hantar barang tu dah tak ada which is dalam surprise tu satu part tu dah tak ada kita tolong buatkan that's why customisation tu penting maksudnya orang yang nak bagi hadiah tu
dia memang gift put in thoughts dalam apa yang dia nak bagi orang tu walaupun dia tak boleh hantar sendiri tapi thoughts tu ada ah
a'ah dia bukan the for the sake of just giving but giving with means lah macam tu
nama dia kotak riang okay boleh search kat Instagram pada kotak riang okay
yes that's right tu satu second is
err ni macam baru jer start like semalam first of january err a'ah but err this one
tak tak tak buat sendiri lah just drop ship barang orang lah kan err nak jual healthy food
uh dia uh makanan-makanan yang orang yang nak diet orang yang nak sihat cari faham ke
dia sugar free punya products ah
ah betul macam apa konjac mee tu kan
yes yes ada ada err antara barang yang angah drop ship
yang no sugar
but it taste like the real peanut butter ada peanut butter ada almond butter chocolate yang macam Nutella pun ada
but semua yup sugar free
okay so next next ada resolution ada
I think that's good and actually cakap pasal nak
betul and it's not something wrong pun
betul and it give benefits to other people as well
betul kita pun Google dulu
mmhmm kan selain daripada save money maybe you can gain some money as well mm mm

entah lah resolution ni
main sukan lah berdebat lah apa semua kan so it was very interesting life
interesting as well because I have my own money kan very interesting tapi
come back at home like for six and then at ten dah kelat sebab penat and that is very non healthy lifestyle for me lah so in twenty twenty one my resolution is to have
no no that's not the I want some me time yang can benefit myself as well bukan macam me time just leisure time lepak-lepak tak ada tak ada
a'ah betul dulu ingatkan abah kan main guitar kan then semua anak-anak abah ni kan angah sorang jer yang

and one more thing I think macam macam kak long kata lah belum kaya lagi kan but in the process in the journey sepanjang-panjang nak jadi kaya tu
you actually contribute a lot to the society mm from the the fundraising that you made or daripada the job that you created for other people
you know those small small things actually walaupun tak kaya but it means a lot kan
mm betul
mmhmm betul
what is your advice for a startup macam angah
tapi cakap pasal start up tadi kan sampai sekarang tak puas hati lagi tau
han ji pyeong patut jadi hero
mmhmm betul
pasal dia dah bring the character tu
a'ah betul
betul lah tu tapi nam do san tu hais geram jer lah tengok
um ni macam very small small small thing tapi important lah
tak nak procrastinate ah
kan sebab itu lah punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh ha hapo pun takde
betul err and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better faham ke macam like very last minute tapi it push us to to make a better thing faham ke ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard lah actually faham ke sebab ya maybe maybe
so tahu lah kita ada deadline kan deadline is twentieth october lah konon kan but the boss want to see the progress bukannya on twenty nine tu I can do everything faham ke
yes betul
hmm tapi susah lah
the the algorithm dia mmhmm
a'ah eh tapi kadang-kadang kan bukan kita sebut tau benda kita fikir pun macam keluar juga
pelik kan angah rasa dia tanam chip lah
mm sometimes benda yang kak nor cakap dengan umi pun macam nak beli apa-apa benda tu keluar dekat angah ha
ya entah entah camera ni so scary
tapi kita pun sedar jer kan like the like kita punya that time ada yang kelat
memang terus scroll bawah sekali tick
internet internet ni they works in a very interesting way
live okay lagi ni some people err even make like house tour kot
I think I think that is very something that unacceptable to me lah maybe others think that it's for fun but for me it's like you are showing to people how to enter your house faham ke
dah lah mostly yang buat tu semua wealthy people
ah faham
but I think kan angah pernah dengar satu video ni
err actually kita boleh set for err ni for iPhone users lah kita boleh set set for one day how many hours that we spend ah bila kita dah exceed kan dia akan keluar notification that you have exceed the the total hours of err social media or something like that lah for today
hmm boleh boleh set dekat phone I think we can also keep track lah on that day how many how many time on the day how many time how many hours
ya we we are adults takkan nak ada parental control lagi
a'ah oh ye ah
eh seronok lah
eh orang nak tengok nak try ah
menarik ah
kan I think that this is how we would faham ke
kita akan more determined
if we can see what is the result faham ke kalau kita macam okay four hours nak concentrate kita tak dapat sebab kita tak nampak apa-apa kita tak boleh nak materialise benda tu tau
ha oh walaupun apps yang acknowledge pun it's enough
betul betul betul betul kan kita manusia memang mcam tu ah
ah apa dia
oi menarik
kadang-kadang kita nak tengok waktu pukul berapa sekali a'ah lepas a'ah betul
betul yes
that's correct anyway cakap pasal kucing tadi dah entah lah kucing ni kan diorang ni macam addictive eh
ya ikut suka hati dia
ya betul tak tak tahu lah kita bela kucing untuk apa sebenarnya
tak ada hati kan kadang-kadang kan kan kalau kita adopt kucing kan macam kita pergi adopt kucing kan tapi kan macam orang kata
it is not you who choose the cat the cat choose you faham ke
dah lah diorang selalu buat dumb things tapi kita still bela bagi makan
but they pee everywhere kenapa elegant
huh dia kan tidur terkangkang tengok kucing-kucing kita
that is very interesting kadang-kadang kan teringat kucing ni pun boleh gelak sendiri tau
angah terfikir satu benda but it's very random lah tapi something that angah memang selalu terfikir lah bayangkan lah kan kalau tiba-tiba
ada zombie apocalypse apa kita akan buat
tak sebenarnya kan zombie ni boleh jadi ke
ya betul
ah kat rumah a'ah
eh I think angah pernah sembang dengan kak long ke siapa dulu ke it is only my imagination but I think we have plan before that we want to sell zombie survival kit pernah tak kita ke itu imaginasi angah ada
uh huh macam cukup makan cukup first aid ah kan
oh it's not specifically for zombie lah tak beli ke a'ah
war ke mm mm
tapi kan cakap pasal bunker tadi angah terfikir lah kalau kalau kita buat rumah kan kita hire contractor
then the contractor will know everything about our house isn't that dangerous ke sometimes I would think that way lah macam okay kalau kita buat secret room then the contractor tu akan tahu secret room kita kat mana what if the contractor have bad intention
ah lepas tu ah faham aduhai
oh back to cat conversation cakap pasal cat ni kan diorang addictive
eh kalau kita pindah rumah baru kan I really want to build a catio for our cats
mm betul
ah that's what I was thinking about catio tu dekat hujung sekali depan tu swimming pool
so when we were swimming kita boleh hi kucing macam tu
and and sometimes I feel like I want them to swim with us as well boleh ke kucing boleh berenang ke
oh comelnya kalau kucing berenang
oh ye ke
steady boleh berenang ah
macam glasshouse lah kan cantiknya
and itu lah kita punya permulaan kepada segala-galanya tak ada harapan tak ada
perancangan so tak ada apa-apa kan takkan tiba-tiba terjadi selain ada pelan kan
siapa ramai tak percaya time tu
mm mm betul
cakap pasal cross country kan
kesian kan tengok ramai stewardess steward pilot yang laid off sekarang
mmhmm memang tak boleh langsung boleh lah but a few flights jer yang boleh pun sekarang
tapi tapi tapi pasal steward and stewardess ni kan ada cadangan untuk bawa
err steward and stewardess jadi macam helper lah ataupun additional staff dekat poly lah sebab diorang ada basic first aid punya basic ha
a'ah betul
kan a'ah sebab dia memang ada basic
betul mmhmm
pastu kebanyakan yang kena sack yang kena laid off
pun akan start business akan start buat business
because that's the fastest way untuk kita do something instead of waiting for jobs to come to you
employer pun tak semestinya nak ambil kerja dalam waktu sekarang
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul
social yup betul betul
actually kan kalau tengok macam junior junior pun kan ada pun ramai yang
ya betul satu err satu sebab
jarang lah kita buat assignment sorang-sorang waktu dulu pun mesti discuss dengan kawan-kawan share jawapan like very very normal things to do kan tu satu second
our youth feeling faham ke
mm betul
ya lepas tu dah habis online learning
tiba-tiba graduate online then terus masuk kerja
then you will you ya we have to face a very hard life waktu kerja without your friends anymore
mmhmm experience pula
I think dekat china err they even built a academy for influencer kat china korea takyah cakap lah korea memang
itu memang like being famous is like
most of their punya ambitions lah ya being famous become actors actress dengan idol idol
tu lah tapi
budak-budak muda sekarang memang look up to
because artist ni orang akan minat dia sebab character yang dia bawa dalam drama character dia bawa dalam movie but influencer ni orang minat dia apa atas apa hidup dia faham ke so that's why people lagi look up to influencer daripada
mmhmm betul
eh apa kak long punya macam
for our family lah kan apa kak long punya resolution
mm dan angah rasa sejak kan sejak kita punya ni movement order ni angah rasa kita pun memang banya spend time
mm together sebagai satu family
I think same quite the same things juga lah
I want all of us to be involved together in everything that we do faham ke yes macam
main dengan kucing memasak ke
a'ah betul cantik-cantik
they can remind us satu lagi satu we want mm make them
we want we want to prove that we can do it to them faham ke macam angah cakap dengan kak long gini kan mesti angah rasa macam kena tunjuk ni boleh buat ah ah takkan cakap kosong jer
