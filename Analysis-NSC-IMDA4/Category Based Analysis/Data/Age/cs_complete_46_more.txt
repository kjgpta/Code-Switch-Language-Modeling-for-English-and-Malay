I don't know what kerapu
I think I tengok first because usually for me
something fancy for tengah hari lah makanan tengah hari lah
uh nasi you know
fancy tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam more like salad lah because of your condition right because of your kencing manis right your diabetes
for the for me the kids kalau ada nasi ada ikan they will eat lah
uh but I don't want to buy tadi bila I beli ikan tu I tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam ice box bau so I rather just buy satu ekor ikan lah
dari beli dua ekor itu hari I beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis
you know susah nak habis abeh end up buang you know so I rather not
sebab tu tadi bila kat sheng siong tadi
I beli satu ekor ikan aje
uh tapi ada kala pula I feel serba salah when I do that kena beli satu pula nanti the kids I want some more fish you know macam
kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada plan tapi mak bawa makan ke
you know atau my mother give food untuk uh she packed food from from her house right then she give also that would also
I have to wah I edit punya rak
tapi semalam punya not not that bad lah but it's just a simple two three pages
jadi macam eh
you know macam if you sit you if you did it this way for your write article you will have less problem lah I would have edited even faster but semalam I
I edit tak I didn't really require a lot of time lah think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours dah habis ah edit
uh tadi I berbual dengan my
my russian teacher tu the skype over skype eh
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was err he was a having a conversation with his friends our uh what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me yang
I and the song was from tokyo square then she's like tokyo square so he thought that dia dari jepun ke group ni then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean lah it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was uh
but the song actually nice tapi dia pakai lagu sukiyaki punya lagu tau do you know sukiyaki right there's this
uh it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow kak tina to this concert by tokyo square
uh that is the originally is from tokyo square but there's some uh famous mat salleh singers sing that song lah western singers that err sing err tokyo square punya lagu but that is I say macam singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
a lot of talent lah they don't macam you know
uh but dia punya melody has been reused and reused by other bands lah but that is not the most famous tokyo square
uh because like I mean nama tokyo square tapi dari singapore you know macam
because my I think kak tina did some events ah for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
and that they were performing dekat mana tau kat depan if I am not wrong eh at this padang area near parkway parade
no macam this area dekat depan parkway ke sebelah kat parkway ke one of those area lah because parkway was you it was like a famous lah you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center dekat eighties nineties mana ada banyak
I think kalau mungkin mungkin yang singapore yang rock band lah yang dulu-dulu ah
ah the malay rock band ramli sarip all that there is known tapi for the english
medium eh english medium tak banyak that's why tokyo squares is one of tapi yang you kata sam willows sekarang famous there were a few ah
like they say kembangkan dia punya talent ah
you know macam yang ada english the err english medium ada but they are not
they are not world famous lah macam the their world famous because they perform
like macam siapa jacintha ah jacintha abisheganaden I think abisheganaden is it halim
but macam you have err macam art fazil you have err jai eh is it jai is it the
I think macam we we we know okay like macam acting a lot of them because of the
the khairul anuar join siapa apa
the malay channel lah siapa tu
ah not really talent train lah it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market macam kira malaysia ada market you know
macam nak cakap pasal comedian ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar comedian pun comedian macam err suhaimi eh suhaimi part time you know at least dia dia part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
no I think macam pasal singapore banyak pakai script
singapore the the ah they're not very good with improvisation tak bagus
ah I I I understand macam boboi boboi punya jokes eh boboi the group the maharaja lawak eh kan they have boboi they have the different
ah what is that either let like either when they talk about loghat eh there's always a tema tema like like loghat like is always going to be malaysia menang because singapore tak pandai buat loghat you know
they can really do loghat know and they really are very good at imitating macam singapore punya macam they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know macam malaysia really bercakap loghat loghat is accent right kira loghat orang kedah orang kelantan and then
kita punya loghat is loghat bahasa baku
no no but they are very professional I remember I pergi err the not kedung kodek what's that
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching pi mai pi mai tang tu at that time was imuda imuda that there were some people sayang they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform ee apa tu they can really perform macam
buat masa yang berpanjangan tau macam ada stamina is really that atau buat orang macam orang pergi kelantan kelantan they they the people doing dikir barat
they can really do dikir barat the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
uh macam for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs lah
the yang yang lama-lama lah
dia kata orang glamour ada what is that ah
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia dia perform astro punya lah
I think astro punya organise so ya guest judge was
ah tapi dia ada all the the veteran singer so hady was face off with this other
ah so they have this person in the end dia menang dua-dua two of them memang kan
why now you know macam like in a way kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat malaysia you know
ya pasal dia dah then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really menyanyi is really his talent you know
no but macam I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series eh
junior eh yuan ching you tahu you kenal dia was she some
ya zoe tay was from your ni
yuan ching yuan ching yang dekat jurong eh
no but but you had that yuan ching punya alumni yuan ching punya alumni is it yuan ching
yuan ching macam hancing the the yuan ching punya alumni dinner right you eh
err your friends apa ashik eh siapa
amin kan dia orang tak pergi eh
I told you the three of you form a table what with your other friends and sama kelas
now memang susah
cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar jer
is it badan besar rambut putih eh
ya macam macam macam seroja was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
you know to be ya I mean be err get get new more books you know but macam the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just macam seroja
you you are I'm not I'm older than you sayang
ah tu ah si si siapa was telling me these millennials ah because it's
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right mana tengok seroja I tengok kesian ah
dia beli rumah tu about satu point satu satu point dua juta tau
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to uh buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house pun err
uh it's slow down macam orang pun tak nak beli
rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu I think
uh dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual
macam tinggi lah tak nak jual harga tinggi lah she just want to sell uh
ah and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle dekat
her condo tu kan not near the beach right so macam
to her is an effort lah to go back and forth naik basikal di situ and I think a bit ulu lah because situ kan jauh kan
she like cycling but macam
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but macam
for me when I see her I tengok I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
macam is typical of err they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
macam still tinggal that rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual and still have err her she's start to pay ready for her house
no no hers was second hers was a new lepas tu dia kata ada
ah tapi besar because rumah dia belum habis renovate eh because they had to for stall the
uh the no the the macam kira development dah habis semua tapi orang semua I think they nak renovate ah sikit-sikit kan
tapi pasal renovation kena put on hold because of the COVID
so I was thinking to myself oh not bad eh dia tak payah jual rumah in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to jual rumah so maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta I mean she's already nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
maybe she has the money ada duit juga ah
that one betul-betul ada err pool or view of the pool ya
tiga tiga bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice sayang it was like
uh I think I think for dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal condo she shared with a flatmates dulu dia tinggal dekat sekarang dia tinggal kat condo I think she found a new flatmate eh and then macam kat kat russia kan they don't have this quality of
uh so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware lah about the development about about buying condo uh that dasha is aware so macam macam it's very sexy lah
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because dekat itu dekat dengan russian nya embassy
and and then dekat bukit timah dia nak dekat dengan nature agaknya orang putih gitu kan
ah shared dengan ramai ramai ramai
I tak tahu I never ask
uh but I think she like the location agaknya
uh because this mat salleh they like their nature they like
uh dia naik bus dia dia orang naik bus
because maybe the flatmate yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya
they're not really macam kita a bit rude about money we talk about money like macam I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think dasha will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about macam
macam it's not really the thing lah macam us cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual
you tahu this this year I don't see her spending anything dia tak beli baju baru
mungkin dengan boyfriend dia ke apa kita tak tahu kan mungkin ada boyfriend lah
kalau like that okay eh
uh but sami suka
macam dia dia kata dia ada swimming pool kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna kan uh that's fixed to me condo lah
macam some of the aminah punya friends right they tinggal condo ah
uh macam err I guess that's macam we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
yang pak ali eh you know pak ali always get the best grades macam dean's lists lah borhan also the one the radio warna right but they were from it doesn't
macam ya people used to think that err
he was educated sayang he was educated when he was young he was educated in eton tau
did I ask him what did you do he's baba budak orang baba
dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi tuition
dia pergi tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
uh teaching macam he has he has his full time job
even after tu dia continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so macam you know you have this
but he's very nice lah I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time kita because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you berbual and then dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang so most of the time we speak melayu and baba so
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him oh can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me lah of course lah he won't pay for it lah but because it's my mahal right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there dia beli dia ingat I don't know how it is now terrence
no no no dia nak pergi actually tak nak pergi singapore
tapi dia kata dia not good enough lah dasha kata sebab tu eton they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually eton then after that the eton got
a professor but dia orang lah
or american eh but very fluent in russian and then because err project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but macam macam russian only a few know
uh tapi be you know why they go to russia because dia punya tuition fee
singapore I tak tahu but uh
so there were err she was speaking russian to her husband and dia she have two children two or three children they all go to sabah or sarawak then after that yang orang kat belakang dia there's this man ah err medical doctor
dia kata oh he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns err medicine in russia
no but I think is in a hospital in malaysia dia orang recognize
I think wait singapore punya that they have a different different tu ah
because I remember my friend you know yang arwah nadim tu yang meninggal tu isteri dia
belajar medicine dekat kelantan lah if I'm not wrong kelantan also
but kelantan ni banyak
but kelatan punya he he actually don't want to go there he doesn't want her to stay there
tak recognise kelantan punya medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes dia come back
err to be dia kerja kat mendaki kan arwah dia until he very sick already he went over there
um but yang your friend tu siapa
yang your friend tu yang follow kita tu pergi kashmir siapa tu
you know that the hair stylists yang I pergi the hairdresser tu yang pergi kedai cina tu anak perempuan dia tak boleh masuk dekat medicine school dekat singapore so she actually took out a I think two hundred thousand dollar loan
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka australia
ah because dia tak stress lah macam singapore
kan bilang
err so pula dapat keluar pergi luar negeri
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology siapa si
ustazah yang teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example yang daripada
apa eh
it's not considered a degree level macam for example you want to be a teacher right
yes that's what my ustaz told me
so macam it has to be like they recognize degree
jordan I tak tahu
could be ah because mak dia mak dia tak nak but but but uh the ustaz kata that's the reason macam for example kita dapat second upper the second upper uh or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya that's why like people say why they go to madrasah for that's the big question everybody ask
agaknya ah tu
I don't know now err COVID I tak tahu ah
so that's why a lot of people recommend pergi jordan
there's dia orang punya
kan itu hari si king of jordan datang
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like tiga empat daripada eygpt and then she knows other dialect lah so dia kata ada kesian because she was telling me because dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz
ustaz hasan so dia bilang ah dia bilang dengan I lah some of them come from negeri yang you know they come from kampung so only know dialect tau dia orang tak tahu so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend ah
and this lady have a condition ah dia kata then I ask err your cousin eh how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into eh a'ah kak tini bukan senang you know like nak kena ni nak kena surgery nak kena ni can you imagine nak kena like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap lah nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people agaknya derma I think embassy derma agaknya and then spend money on them you know err spend the money on translations err these translators
oh ya because the the king would err hussein not hussein I I I kenal bini dia uh he was very impressed the singapore side very cepat very efficient
but when I was telling doctor ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia showing off
uh that is the rumour lah that she tunjuk the jam
ya but it's also something that has strength lah because her fusha is very good like the orang arab dengar fusha lah yang I try to berbual dengan ustazah hadijah
itu fusha but okay so macam the the difficult dialect is not egyptian lah according to them lah but I don't know I tengok egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt punya dialect very near fusha the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
banyak orang arab banyak kan very diverse
dia tinggal kat egypt itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama she even take she even take talaqqi courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take talaqqi she taught she taught me how to tajwid
she told me yang the and then when I ask abi abi say betul
ada yang ustaz yang famous sampai boleh kalau you buat salah your bacaan sampai boleh ambil you know your you know the what is that thing ah
when they collect the smoke the cigarette punya ashes leh
like garang ah
let her bukan poly tak boleh pakai tudung pakai jer tudung kat poly
or you want her to go okay lah go pakai then there's the other thing lah
I think err tengok appetite dia macam math and science
in singapore you cannot do well macam
macam I don't think so lah
err namanya
tak tahu ah I just tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat lah but she's very close to murni so now she's the
punya translation unit she she's the head you know
pasal I selalu berbual dengan dia
then I made her watch asian alida bahasa melayu I even I even err
gunakan err
apa tu penterjemahan eh
penterjemah subtitle ah dalam bahasa melayu
dia suka ah mula-mula tak suka mula-mula tanya apa mak maknya tu kau tak sayang nyawa kau eh you know the cerita ejen ali kau tak sayang nyawa kau
no I think pasal dia dia daripada kaku dia macam kaku but the my mum was very impressed that dia menonton filem tanggang eh dari awal hingga akhir so I said what's happening you know
anak going
tapi tapi dia suka dia suka tengok my computer ah
okay kita punya ni nak tamat sayang
but she also get shares which I am I think she her limit is three to four hours after that she like okay don't need computer pun takpe ah she has this limit ah
I think in really should learn I know kata takpe sekarang ni tengah tengah waktu akhir dah dah peperiksaan dah berakhir pun masih masih nak belajar I said no lah no nothing belajar I said this is like membaca buku

sekarang what we hear lepas tu ada kata start january ada start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
err tu lah I mean the the the
correspondents tu macam last time when I go melbourne study kan
in seoul is one of the agency other agency pun ada so like this uh uni oh kaplan one of it is there any other agency
uni mana apa buat
but if there's no choice how rasa if
the one that those without the apa is without the examining examination tu macam mana
so nak kena ambil I mean it's the same
if she opt to other macam early childhood
can she use the diploma or tak boleh pasal dia tak bridging
ya example kalau oh this one ada the next one is this one is uh no not examinable
that's two lah satu sama ada dia nak ambil with examinable
and also must know whether the diploma if she has tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi kan
cause if she wait again dah she waste one year ni dia wait again tiga bulan
I thought she say dia punya sekolah macam
career gardens apa
is different course now this the uni is still exist lah I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more kenapa low intake ke
but the thing kalau macam because now pun she take the bus pun she will pay adults fee just no school pass kan
mm waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that baik go to other place seh
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out nanti tak tahu lagi
this is kaplan tukar dia punya uni kan with these courses
can check online tak
cause now is limited time eh sekarang dua puluh plus
I her other friends sekolah mana private mana
kaplan juga bukan
with her behaviour seram
your lifestyle lah kan macam
campur-campur orang okay uh jaga diri
because suasana lain tau suasana part malaysia suasana part suasana part
ada tau ah
tu lah yang si ustaz anak dia kan remember murdoch apa yang ustaz salim pun kan you just uh go over to malaysia lah rather than go
what you can when uh other uni other places kena start dia punya tu kan then from there

ah now SAM ada new uh so called syllabus come out for english
are you if you are offered are you interested to be uh enrolling your son ke gitu lah kan
from there then you see kalau ratio dia only about ten percent
tengok uh I don't know how you I mean you can limit to one class lah kan
kalau ramai orang healthy response then you can consider open kalau tak healthy then
better ya cause we don't want need to to be up to student the student then one teacher I mean you buat habiskan duit on that
no I didn't do anything tak ada your one
I tak buat apa-apa
dia suspend

his is dia punya rezeki dia lah kan if you don't want to be
in situation yang menyusahkan oh okay nak terus okay jer

kalau dia is the funny guy apa macam you know he can uh communicate with the kids ya first he's a guy kan
kids semua suka girls ladies
gitu ah if this guy is that one that uh can communicate uh friendly then he's it lah kan

oh okay eh tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk ah I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right macam hot chocolate or like
eh hot chocolate dekat
yup yup correct ah rindu seh tu
yang the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then bila wombat tu macam bau kita punya makanan wah he just like crawled up to our door
ya eh how come tak ambil gambar seh
tu ah kecoh saje
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like kesian when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ah lepas COVID pergi mana eh
dia penat gila ah you have to break and make lots of stops right
ya I really hope this goes away soon seh K tak sabar
you can actually leave your car over there kan macam
so macam like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport ah there was car
tapi rasa macam you macam boring gitu
eh selamat tak seasick eh
weirdly I miss the supermarkets kelakar kan kelakar tak
they are just so lain right
ya lah that's one of our ways that kita nak save duit kan
I don't know I rasa apa dah pakai
err wait err K let me recall eh van diemen's was the one yang kat farm right
and then there was gelato messina which was dekat bandar like the city area
and gelato messina was eh what flavours were there lupa ah
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and macam all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato messina was like hip ah macam modern
so macam um I don't know eh
eh amorino yang mana satu seh
yes yes I remember amorino was the one where they shape the ice cream macam bunga like that macam the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but macam tak memorable sangat ah
uh oh it's a tough one err macam mana eh err
tak I'm sure you like my messina better right
pening seh I tengok
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours ah macam
macam there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good ah that's not something that's easily found here
eh but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so macam you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're lapar like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
borong market okay trying to remember
macam it wasn't it wasn't like popular or macam ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet lah basically
like I remember there was one macam
apa eh flavour ni macam some honeycomb thingy right
pisang goreng is it pisang goreng
macam they said that it was pisang muda goreng or something like that
eh eh mana nak dapat ah
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else lah like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie sebelum tu apa
what's dragon's den tak pernah dengar seh
ini macam shark tank ke apa
oh macam like the article like she published or something eh
miss all the good food seh overseas but I miss um ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas macam masak sendiri and all kan
I do I do like macam
apa eh for example prata probably like we would actually
trying to find a prata shop or teh tarik shop and pay an exorbitant amount untuk beli just to macam
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then kan ya tu ah
entah ah maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than kat sini
kau singapore pun ada seh
what was so nice about it ah was it like the spices or apa apa yang sedap sangat ah
livable boy sama makan sama hidup eh
sedap kan like apa eh what do we have shepherd's pie ah
and then um ya like we shared quite a bit ah we went there I think malam eh
tu ah tak ingat ah
wah rindu gila seh
um let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes kat
sedap kan like
like like I didn't even know something macam so basic and simple can taste so sedap you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait apa what was the filling dalam jacket potato dia lupa ah
ya macam I don't think it was tuna what was it ah just like sour cream eh it was ya something like really simple but remember kita order lepas tu kita order lagi lepas tu ya it was that good ah
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said ah before the freshness of the produce and macam ya things are just
so many things to miss about being overseas apa lah yang kita boleh buat kat singapore sekarang
ya lah that one standard ah standby duit jer
macam ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money lah but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores pasal dia orang suka touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience err like it's over there it's like
yang unbeatable lah and ya you I think
it's not just one brand tapi macam berlambak ah brand
bukan bicester
okay can you jog my memory again york mana satu
okay lah just want to check it out while we are there betul aqilah
so right what eh did we go to any theme parks ah kat sana like I can't remember like during our trip
ya only only that one err that one place ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia
yang ada the one with the that float what do you call it ah
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope apa eh what is it called ah
ya but basically there was that fun huge float kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu we just slide down the slope ya get it is it
ya that was nice and then that was this um eh mahal eh

macam macam what what would err the like significant moments of the trip
oh selamat ah spain menang

malas lah nak buat zoom zoom ni I'm not comfortable lah nanti
nanti I keep looking at the teacher while I dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat teacher nadia
just like sad that her malay teacher tu
cikgu melayu dia cikgu hafizah dah tak ada ah
err cikgu suhanis is there lah definitely she's
but I believe cikgu iza will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say cikgu suhanis is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then cikgu iza make it more interesting
when nadia is in P three err cikgu hafiza she's lucky because she knows cikgu hafiza even before she started
ah teaching her so cikgu hafiza already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
when when the teacher she tak suka
see like the I mean not apa
um dia punya prefect punya tu
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance eh her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her kakak
at least she got two to her ni to her name
ya dia suka panjat-panjat pe banyak pe they go hiking and everything but then sekarang
she's the one yang climbing all over the place
tak boleh loose out ke dia
dia takleh kalah you understand or not
that's why dia main game dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang jer tapi I think dah I rasa dah better lah sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh lah dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam iman main nak menang
then you nak nanti settle the boys
I don't know if see kalau tak sempat masak
macam penat lah nak masak ini hari I tak tahu nak masak apa
nanti you just get
but I think it sounds better to last night I think I didn't hear sangat
semalam I think dah kurang ah
nasib nasib baik dia orang suka minum they they dia orang minum air putih
I think she's coming from sengkang I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later si mas ni
they've prepared so much so half a year later baru dah towards the end nak nak nak dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat
kalau tak nanti kelam kabut because kalau you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
because the thing is for me dia punya the the the problem sum lah
baik lah as long as it's not so expensive lah but I think this teachers are
okay boleh
okay lah boleh
ah next time me parents gateway you kena cepat-cepat kasi I tau
parents gateway punya details nanti kalau you dah start kerja I tak tahu apa-apa seh
the cikgu I mean the the and tasha tasha's teachers are using class dojo
like your what like what your sister was mentioning lah during this COVID it's best that they don't change classes because it's easier for contact tracing it's easier lah they don't want to ignore it because if not you have to go back and change back then the thing is our the girl also pun what like like tasha they she still moved around to
semuanya okay
oh aku baru balik dari batam meet my family during this COVID lah
some place most of the places is quiet lah some of them err ada yang dah tutup tak ada apa tu business kan some of them close
ah like massage parlours all dah tutup
a lot yang know like people with families lah with families I think affected them a lot orang some of them macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over kesian
so he dia dah tak dah takde kerja so he buat tu lah parking lah do the parking
tanam sayur kat kat kat apa dekat tu ah dekat tu kat barelang
tanam sayur dapat gaji lah sikit-sikit
ya yang macam kan normally kan over there when you park your car before you move kan ada orang datang they they call it orang tukang parking lah so they jaga to park jaga that parking area parking shift so one day I think the pay is about hundred thousand which is about singapore ten dollars
harvest already then after that jual ah kat pasar okay okay okay then other than that how's how's the the the the mall there the tourists there and the
what do you call it the massage spa abeh shopping centre
huh that means from singapore you have to fly to jakarta first then from jakarta quarantine for one night lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang then pergi batam why never go batam directly from singapore take ferry
okay okay tanah merah because you know just recently I heard I read this news you know this singaporean that have not return back from singapore for seventeen years ah dia cakap macam macam nazi lah macam world war two lah kena halau sana halau sini I not sure whether it's true or not lah but
ah so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like macam nazi lah but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason ah
ah okay lah because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have sentosa hotel I don't know lah these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning ah betul tak then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
okay lah alhamdulillah lah at least okay apa at least something kan daripada takde apa-apa then kalau kata orang tu kalau tak nak tak nak tak nak bayar then jangan lah keluar duduk kat singapore jer betul tak
oh abeh sekarang tengah buat apa lepak ah sekarang tak buat apa-apa ah
makan tidur makan tidur terus menjadi tau badan cannot no badan semua menjadi nanti have to go for exercise already have to keep fit already if not ah mati ah then what what what what what you doing later after this
okay lah you are become your own boss what now is your own boss ah err own own job own own money everything your own don't don't need to report to anybody what just report to the money the longer you work you get more money err but kerja kerja kerja sikit dapat sikit kerja banyak dapat banyak okay lah alhamdulillah lah kata orang kan
okay lah you control your own finances lah in a way that you can control your time then kalau ada apa-apa boleh habis siang kalau takde apa-apa boleh kerja lambat sikit so at least in a way
new year tahun ini jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak
betul betul betul I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd lah so
apa-apa yang countdown semua dekat neighbourhood estate jer lah
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning lah macam north east south west ke apa so kat mana-mana yang okay kau tinggal north ada bunga api tinggal south ada bunga api west ada bunga api so instead of going to the central punya bunga api so everybody goes your own division their own area their own kampung to enjoy lah but anyway I mean
singapore bila
sixteen march ke
sixteen march dia orang tutup sixteen march sekali kira march april may june july august september november a'ah betul lah dah sembilan bulan ah
pejam celik pejam celik dah nine months dah nak masuk satu tahun
you no need to take sikit-sikit what what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
you have to book through these five different platform okay err yang satu changi and then err I think trip err there's another three more lah aku tak ingat mana satu err then
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself ah you can use that or you can use partly the only thing yang you cannot do yang kau tak boleh buat is kau buat stack up maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus then kita combine dua ratus kita stay in hotel for free ah itu tak boleh tapi
kalau let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can uh offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up ah that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it lah so in the domination of ten meaning let say kalau kau example kalau kau pergi zoo ke apa kan maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars lah or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that ah tapi tak boleh combine lah that's how it goes but
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to kelam-kabut kata orang kan ah pelan-pelan ah next year pun boleh january pun boleh february pun boleh as long as pakai sebelum july lah so ya
kau belum pernah pergi sea aquarium ah eh talking about sea aquarium aku pun pernah pergi ah adventure cove
ah mampus
macam mana boleh tak orginal ada potong potong ke mampus kat mana ni kat batam ni indonesia lah
dia ambil they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus jer ah kurang ah wah ini macam pun boleh eh mati
mampus take advantage of the whole situation lah to get something ah
takut daripada negative jadi positive
macam-macam ah eh sekarang ni
oh ya ya saiful one so touching ah I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that pergi kat semberang tambak johor and and one of them dekat woodland one of them dekat johor dekat apa tu tempat tu eh eh
is this correct entah mana tempat tu
they they they can see johor kan tapi dia punya wife dekat ni kan skudai kan eh bukan dekat setulang kan

err saiful wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID semua tarik-tarik then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore ah those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end tak jadi pergi but alhamdulillah they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia what so kat malaysia semua cancel kan everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that ah I think during that period still
people are still was-was fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that
and then the wife is there but lucky he get married in singapore then after that go sanding dekat johor kan ya ya ya true true true true
no but singapore pun ada
singapore boleh
ya but the nikah dekat singapore kan johor okay
tak tahu because if not have to pay still have to pay what that means he if he bring his wife
empat ribu enam ratus ringgit ringgit dah macam divide by three one thousand plus lah so he has to stay two weeks first in the hotel for stay home I mean err lah consider
stay for two weeks instead of seven days kelakar betul lah malaysia ini
asal dua minggu tak tujuh hari johor pun kelakar juga
malaysia ni

nanti nanti you you choose ni masa you nak log in ke macam masa bila
oh masa log in baru you choose
ye lah dah log in baru choose lah
so K ni dah tahu
tak lah macam okay masa you dah masuk dalam
ah then cause sometimes inside kan masa you tengah tengah scroll scroll sana tengah tengah meeting ke apa and then sometimes you just want to wipe
apa eh
you nak show you punya itu ke
sometimes kan cause they have the host kan host boleh share screen kan
ah sometimes then kita nampak screen si host kan abeh sometimes kalau macam mana kita nak macam
nak show kita punya ke ataupun I just want to say eh eh so this is mine then how do I show
ah tak nak lah
ee ee kalau okay first masa you join
then you taruk you don't want video
after lepas tu you dah masuk then after that you can you change to like you want video or you have to like rejoin
kena go out balik
no no but then ini when you first join kan takut you join with video or without video
cause so if let's say you dah you dah pilih okay no video
then halfway through you nak change boleh tak
but just now I remember tak boleh sini
ah tu masa starting lah masa dia tu
ye lah ye lah can can can can
ah ni mummy tak tahu
eh eh oh ni dia under kat mana more eh
dah record then aku kat mana

ah tu ah tu ah tu tak a specific person maksudnya you hantar dia jer dapat tahu orang lain tak boleh baca after the whole tu pun tak dapat baca juga itu I nak
ye lah
oh okay okay macam mana
boleh choose okay okay this is one option yang bagus lah
ah macam mana
leceh lah eh okay lah okay okay okay
learning learning takpe tengah belajar
bagus juga eh
macam-macam juga function dia sometimes mummy tak pakai banyak
mummy just tengok macam you know just just listen and then and answer if necessary that's all
quite quite ada function juga eh
tu lah bagus lah must learn ah then I can use
ini yang hantar orang ah link tu eh invite people for meeting eh
cuma mummy rasa ni bagus sikit pasal ni quite macam quite user-friendly you can figure out lah eh kan
ni better I think okay lah quite okay manageable lah kalau you tak tahu pun you macam boleh agak-agak ni ke apa ke kan mm
ah lah tadi
ada macam alah macam team bonding ke
takpe lah cause of this technical thingy tapi tapi boleh lah juga
actually okay except for some people had trouble problem macam tiba-tiba eh tiba-tiba hilang abeh then
bila dia nak start something new activities kan then he they have to like everybody go into that uh use that that thing tu ada problem sikit lah
kita ada macam apa tu escape room tadi
ada abeh kita cari clue actually interesting juga lah
macam um kita used to go macam room kan tapi ni virtual tau tapi
it's find clues sama lah so instead of open up the box apa kan then you just virtually open the box the click and then dapat clue dia then you click newspaper ni dapat clue ni
you see ada
ah ye lah ye lah ye lah macam lah alah itu kan normal escape room macam you dah ambil clue then okay you go to different stages okay you dapat ni solve the first one
okay then you go to the next step then go to the next room ah then sampai the end okay then you solve the the problem
okay lah tadi cuma time lah you must go you must you must really ikut timing lah timing dia macam quite short abeh kita the clues sometimes you really have to like
really tengok apa dia sometimes kita ingat kan it's something cheem tau sekali alamak it's just that that first few letters of the the sentence then you can figure out okay actually what is it
tapi kita pun baca dia punya poem I thought the poem is something to do with the poem kita gi decipher the poem to know actually no need it's just there
tak macam dia nak kasi digit okay you click this okay in this room find the three guard three digit number for you to open up the door
it gives you seven like but then we were just reading the poem kita baca apa poem ni ada tree lah ada women passing by apa lah apa sekali takde terus after that I think we took some time abeh orang tu kasi clue lah actually you don't have to decipher the poem you just it's just there you just look at the poem
sekali one of us oh okay okay I can see number seven
but you baca macam kita betul we read sentence by sentence what's the meaning maybe you know tak ada tak payah you just baca jer kat situ you just see the number the S the E and V and dah
I think escape berapa eh tadi eh satu jam eh
I think satu jam satu jam ya
eh tapi banyak pe
uh actually ya lah tapi ada a few got four stages ah
tu semua sama pe
takde I just focus punya lah
I think so itu I tak tahu ah I think I think they created lah tapi
welfare pack apa
tak boleh lah pasal dah takde social distancing pe macam you kat dalam escape room macam mana nak social distance
lima orang but still you have to keep your distance apa
ya so tak boleh lah
ah ye lah ye lah
oh bayar lah kena bayar lah ada ada

something like they not not take things lightly tapi macam
ya I don't know dia macam whether sikit
previous cases pun gitu apa
tapi betul apa cases macam gini kena betul-betul tengok
macam a few times dulu masa orientation punya program pun
mm but play along with such things kalau you you tak report report lah
ah tapi patut goes with other uni tapi dorang tak report
eh tak kan mesti lah miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
kita nak buat buat seh
um you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling atau lepas COVID nak pergi mana
kalau before COVID
um I won't say most value for money tapi dekat
um dengan dia lawa
ya tu ah I think ah that time I pergi in twenty
sixteen tu I pergi um
okay ah I tak I didn't get to enjoy
tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah go camper van dekat dengan go
uh australia I rasa kalau kita dapat camper van kat new zealand
confirm lawa gila ah
tu ah tapi ya lah macam macam ah jadi kalau macam
kita punya camper van berlubang
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay lah tasmania best lah sebab dapat naik the ocean liner kan travel from melbourne to tasmania tapi
um sydney dengan sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family yang follow jadi
rasa macam best ah sebab you enjoy more with them
ya lepas tu yang kita you makan kat perfect catch
tu pun best ah fish and chips by the river power sia
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to punya fish and chips fish and chips
punya lah tak sedap
ya I went to new zealand dengan my aunties lah and my cousins
err well uh bila you pergi dengan um makcik-makcik ah dia orang punya level of err worry is more because they feel that they are responsible lah for you
I tahu ah tapi bila you dah dengan makcik-makcik I
err dia orang dah eh tak mahu lah tak mahu lah
dia dah pergi counter dah pergi bayar
alih-alih he was walking on the platform
it must be ticked are you fit ada sakit apa-apa tak you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera benda-benda macam gini semua biasa lah kena fill
so they give you a cert lah to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and nah ambil kau punya cert
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tak tak minum ah eh ah kita pergi pub ordered hot chocolate
kita pergi pub pergi pub err hot chocolate tengok bola kat luar
tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan it was raining
um and then bila esok pagi
sekali tiba-tiba um snow fell
lepas tu bila when there was snow err we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
um the advisory was tak boleh drive on the road dulu
and then um apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow yang christchurch um felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so macam lama gila ah lama tak boleh snow macam gitu
ya betul I think that was the first time I rasa snow
err unique experience ah sebab
tak pernah nampak snow kan so
ya ya ya we memang kita tahu it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves lah
err not for snow but I mean just winter kita tak tahu pun there was snow that was gonna happen
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana
the tour company decided okay nevermind we err board the bus and lepas tu drove to another hotel
and um ya we basically tidur kat hotel baru
tapi yang tak bestnya pasal new zealand
um winter obvious sejuk lepas tu
winter sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis
semua benda semua kedai dah tutup then so it was quite boring lah for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that wow at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but tengok so it was kind of boring ah but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night ke two extra night
so hot chocolate ah sedap
tu bukan lah tu some pumpkin spice kan
dekat queen victoria market kan
ah eh tu biasa pasal kita terus makan donut dia kat luar
wah camper van experience lain eh I think
mm ya lah I think by then kita orang macam dah penat I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then uh by the time nightfall kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal lah having wildlife a wombat benda yang
tak pernah nampak kat singapore tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk camper van
melampau jer
ya tu pasal lah
kita tak akan dapat experience benda-benda macam ini sebab tours chances are
ya and I think um partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life sebab
sebab your time is yours
I think yang even on that trip lah yang we kita turun tengok the river delta kan ya
tu ah tak tak sabar tunggu ni COVID habis
lepas COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination lah I'm don't even wanna go
ya tapi kalau you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
jadi kita kasih lah orang yang nak fly fly dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi
kita pergi apa yang kita mampu jer iaitu K
ya tapi okay so there are two ways to go about doing it biasa orang drive
lepas tu tidur rest one night and then esok pagi just sambung pergi border of thailand
ya that one more relax ah takde kelam kabut takde macam rushing for time
drive ke tidur semalam
lepas tu ah pergi penang
nanti lah belum buka tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar
selangor tengah highest for COVID numbers
ya so boleh ah lepas tu lepas dah tidur satu malam pergi penang satu malam baru pergi thailand tapi tu dah kira dua hari ah
kalau nak cepat then tidur penang satu hari esok kita pergi thailand ataupun lagi nak cepat terus to thailand ah tapi penat ah badan sebab it will probably be macam
empat belas jam on the road ah so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired ah
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand kalau the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
lepas tu travel around southern thailand
err I don't know ah tak pernah try tapi jangan bawa kereta ah jangan bawa kereta in
you sewa kereta dekat thailand
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring lah so what I want is kita save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore ah
naik kapal terbang nak sangat kan kapal terbang ah naik ah kapal terbang
okay lah memang best lah tak cakap tak best tapi
tak lah bruny boring lah kirakan macam boat dia kecil apa
oh tu juga
bukan bunker lah cabin lah
okay lah tapi malam we kita tak travel malam so you were travelling at
I mean bila kita baru-baru masuk when the boat started to sail
by the time kita dah tertidur boat dia probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled lah kan when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat lah
then bila pagi dah bangun
lain okay lah I mean dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi I think because of the space that they have
and harga tak so mahal lah
ya because they are fresh produced ah benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap
memang lah
tapi tu ah since
oh dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best ah
okay sabar which one do you prefer you lagi suka van diemen's punya ice cream ke you lagi suka gelato messina
van diemen's was ya betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah farm
macam-macam ah gelato messina ada macam-macam flavour
tapi yang amorino punya
amorino punya I think kita makan
kejap I tak ingat whether that one were trip ke
ah tak salah tu ah
ya I like messina better sebab I rasa
ya tu yang best dia ah
because kalau you you compare van diemen's van diemen's punya flavours are
it's not anything out of the ordinary lah macam K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
kan atau
K lah apple cranberry pun boleh katakan
ada apa yang dekat tu dekat tom's palette
okay tom's palette ke gelato messina
ya ke
but then tom's palette sedap seh
tapi it could also be the fact that
benda tu kita tak pernah try ah contoh eh contoh
when we went to borong market alright K break your head right
I I wouldn't say that sebab dulu dunkin donut pernah ada with their bavarian cream
tapi the the ones that dunkin donut jual tak sesedap ah
ya okay so kalau you imagine ah break your head you punya donut the dough is soft
inti dia penuh kan
which I am inclined to agree sebab about I haven't tasted
tak pada I macam lebih pada okay like
I felt that it was a cross between lemak cili padi dengan uh apa thai green curry
ada lah iras-iras dia
dah dah lepas tu I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den ah dragon's den dragon's den is this uh british show
investors yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak shark tank ah macam shark tank ah
so dragon's den dengan shark tank lebih kurang ah sama ah
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not ah but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted kirakan you bagus ah
ya okay think about it eh kalau you kata you miss the food overseas
no lah just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you cakap oh I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay lah when travel kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example macam
macam makan kat noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
right like like mi dengan
ya so if you were to think about it again macam is it really that fantastic
ah tu ah faham tak
ya it's the spices sebab dia orang okay imagine nandos
so nandos kan macam oh nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
kan ada sudu garfu
that thick milkshake sedap gila
tak boleh replicate ah eh so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop kita masuk
K ah penat saje nak duduk
and baam sedap gila apa tempat ni
betul juga okay lah maybe I think oh what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the ni lah factory outlets
tapi tu bicester village elite ah up ah
bicester ke bister
bukan bicester eh
ya but I think the york punya outlets err better ah
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van um battery mati
tak yang job dia
ah kita dah
so kita travel all the way up untuk pergi york
that's true lah tapi macam travel untuk two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that macam mm
ah tak ada theme park ah
float apa
bukan luga kan
tapi tu mahal ah I rasa
mahal lah I think
tak salah adults
fifty alah fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama ah
maze kat sana ah
haunted house apa
eh itu mengarut seh
eh tu mengarut gila buang buang masa saya pergi tu
ya lah tak menyeramkan langsung
sabar ni trip ke err
is partly because of the weather kan they humid tapi dia panas ah
so walaupun masuk hutan err I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
tapi bila kat dalam panas juga ah sebab takde angin ah
compared to bila kita travel dekat you ingat tak yang kita pergi tasmania
cari waterfall
yang kita cari waterfall tu kan
oh ya K ah at least bila kat dalam sana
dia sejuk sikit oh
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat ah
kalau nak pergi taman negara berpuluh lawa ah saya confirm
err at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu ah euro two thousand eight lah
ya kalau kalau travel as a student
how much you are going to spend so macam for us while kita pergi sana we either just took the
atau kita ambil um kita ambil apa the the budget flight ah
so we were from netherlands kita travel to belgium via bus
kita dah terlepas the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
jauh I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium lah mana belgium is germany
so kita terlepas so konon-konon nak naik taxi ah the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks ah ya
tak juga ah we were winging it lah
ah ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab lepas tu
kita cakap dengan pakcik ni ah driver we need to get to this airport so dia kata that sixty kilometres away
at least macam
so you macam dah alamak macam mana eh but the worst part is that we will we had no money ah there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
no bukan takde duit lah but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang lah kan
habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita hundred and this one ah more than hundred twenty euro habis kita dah duit dah sikit then kita macam alamak macam mana eh
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and nanti I will show you all
dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya trip ni lagi mahal lah
ya lah I I think sama ah macam benda ini juga so dia on
dia on dia punya meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter dah naik two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
lepas tu he said
ya and then dia kata okay you look ah at the meter
sekarang dah hundred three hundred and twenty euro aku off K aku off
ya starting tu dah adventure ah
no but I think kalau spain kalah confirm raih ah
ah but because spain won err I think I think through penalties eh spain menang italy and then ah because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the um there was a big screen dia orang err live telecast
so kita ramai-ramai ah kat sana sama tengok live telecast lah
the trains tutup sia
jalan ah
ah jalan ah so tak ni lah ni dah madrid ah ni dah madrid so madrid dah macam
lepas portugal so kita pergi
so it was netherlands lepas tu ambil bus pergi belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal pergi um flight to madrid
all the way makan ni ah roti dengan tuna ah
tak lah everyday but basically living frugally ah
um my friend and I lah kita dah dah dah lapar ah
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
you go through your hostel dot com ke apa ah
so um jumpa ah kedai kedai muslim ni ah semua muslim brother dah masuk kedai dia apparently kita ternampak ada prata ah
prata ah so macam prata ah
so I don't know whether it was ah an instant prata or prata that they made ah tapi nampak macam prata ah
so my friend and I eh baik ah this harapan prata puas hati lah kan
tu kita dah tengah lapar so kita minta dia enam ah enam eh kau tiga aku tiga lah enam
itu tak perasan lah sebab kita dah tengah lapar ah and harga dia harga tak mahal sangat lah
true dah tengah lapar ah so kita dah okay ah enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar and he couldn't speak english
ah macam gitu ah so dia ah sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu
then macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar
apparently dia orang makan order prata dengan macam sirap ke gula ah
tak I think they tuang the sugar on top ah
so kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
tu pasal lah dia ni dia ni kira macam muslim brother boleh pakai punya ah
and then uh you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita keluar um maybe like after one or after the two
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four ke two to five ah
so it's okay lah as in dia orang tutup sekejap for them to rest lepas tu dia orang buka sampai maybe sepuluh sebelas
oh err in madrid juga I where where when we were walking ah masih masih masih
sekali tiba-tiba there was this bangladeshi guy
kita dah kat madrid eh dia orang bual bual melayu eh muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak
ada pernah kerja kat malaysia
I mean if the opportunity presents itself nak lah kan
kalau ada kerja yang bagus okay ah
ah lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana I mean
kalau kita kat singapore kalau bulan puasa kan macam
okay ah first kita berbual pasal regarding our hobby lah okay ah so you can first what is it your hobby
cakap lah macam okay example like kalau for me my hobbies is ah I like to read books I like to travel I like to
ah mostly spend time dengan kawan-kawan ke apa ah that is my sort of hobbies that I like
ah I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai I don't really like it
punya brand tak ada you don't have any other brand yang you suka ke apa ke
kan and I think you also suka Coach
you pun suka
ah quite lately lah I think that daripada dulu pun you memang suka Coach if not just lately
ah so apa lagi yang you
you apa you minat selain daripada bags
okay because for me ah whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore kan pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak
we apa more like
terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu kan so
important the family makan and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa it's edible lah boleh makan and there times yang you masak pada I is
uh fantastic lah it's good juga lah kan
takpe lah the more the more rounder become most to most
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore nak main bola dah susah I I try to ask my friends to play all
with sharif if the kid maybe can can be done ataupun
I think in terms kalau
ah the whole society punya makeup pun dah changed I think now we are
kalau kalau passion the thing is passion is there
budak-budak cuma only have
to ah play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is lain
kalau sekarang ni when people play is
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if macam
now like dulu kalau kita nak tengok internet pakai computer will really stay in front of the computer
tapi now even with handphone
kan contact the people pun
tak ini lah so the
itu lah the changes in in time eh so in order to survive
ah mentality zaman dulu punya kan tak nak handphone tak nak pakai
ah internet kan I think kalau sekarang ni if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
ah I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be apa terlalu ke belakang if let's say we are too far
have to have to try lah kan tu kadang-kadang when we try pun
susah juga nak nak catch up kan but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that lah kan okay sekarang nak
berbual pasal apa topic lain
kita takde lah travel banyak-banyak tempat kan ah so for our travel is mostly to
ah if not we will be like apa every year at least lah
I think bila kita pergi tu apa boleh
so hope macam apa we can
so biasa lah pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa lah
what are the ah pattern what is the perangai yang kita boleh
ah click atau tak click what is our
err kalau bawa
ah apa
ah yes lah you can ke depan lah
takda lah at least kan
ya when we first sampai the hotel tu
kan bila kita sampai
bilik tu macam okay everything go like so olden
kan ah ah so after lepas dah the bilik tu okay lah but overall
so sometimes kan you have to buy kadang-kadang macam apa
because ah dorang tak jual
so that's why kadang bila kita when
dorang beli to sell at their shop ke apa kan
nak pergi ah
itu bukan itu aja even someone who
to kasi duit
then dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua kan ah
itu lah kan so other than that
ah indonesia juga bali juga
and your dengan best friend you ah
down there pun our friend is a hindu kan
boleh tahan kan tapi dia punya
ah hotel ada sikit ulu lah
ah kan ah pendalaman
tak kotor sangat tapi to me is ah
kotor juga lah kan
ah big buses tak boleh jalan ah um
in terms sana another thing I remember pasal bali tu pasal kita apa
yang sebelah atas tu eh
gunung apa eh gunung eh
ah gunung tu it was fun lah
basically macam atas tu sejuk it's like going to genting highlands
ya cantik memang cantik but the place tempat makan tu it's like all the buildings
so I wonder ni selamat ke nak duduk sini
kan ah I remember going to the toilet pun it's like
ah like a ghost movie punya punya toilet masuk
dekat situ nampak eh toilet ni senyap jer kan tapi pasal nak kencingnya pasal kan nak kena pergi
pergi jer lah kan but luckily it's only me lah I think if he want to go
kita just duduk and talk
ah a'ah near the swimming pool there so talk dengan raja
so ah nasib baik tu satu jam eh
ah banyak juga lah topic boleh berbual takde
we don't clear all macam apa nak cakap apa we talk
ah kita apa
um ya dia datang kita punya wedding a'ah
kan kita travel dengan dia eh quite a few ah kita pergi penang dengan dia ah
banjir ah
yang bestnya pergi rumah P ramlee tu dia punya
a'ah sikit-sikit lah tak semua lah
uh huh kita respect lah
dia kawan ah P ramlee dia kawan P ramlee dia pernah hidup dengan P ramlee lah so roughly dia tahu P ramlee punya sejarah tu macam mana
jambatan bridge ah
sekali pergi ah he got fear of heights
pusing gitu jer uh huh um um
komtar penang tapi itu pun apa apa macam
ya so dorang tutup that one is the
even the penang chief minister pun ah minta tolong dengan
party kan so it's that bad lah kan tapi
memang nasib kita baik lah kita dapat pergi
but I remembered lah yang kita pergi sana tu
mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya flood ke tak flood ke tak kalau dia kata um ah longer way uh huh
so macam kalau apa even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building tu di apa
a bit macam odd lah something good
kan kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia
food museum then there is the upside down museum ada the three D three D museum ah basically is the
basically is err apa taking pictures
punya opportunity lah tapi kalau nak kata museum macam gitu
upside down museum I think dekat singapore pun dah ada upside down museum ah so nanti mungkin kan kalau with the apa
then kita boleh pergi lah upside down museum ah
ini bukan apa ini is so called macam apa lepas gian
kan nak travel tak dapat dekat singapore kita boleh lah buat aje lah
boleh enjoy ke tak itu lain cerita lah kan bab kita a'ah the fans ah our friends pun ada kat sana kadang kita travel pun kita suka bawa our friends kan ah itu lah that's the good part about apa
travelling lah kan ni dah tak travel and the thing is ah dah tak travel tu satu hal then with this COVID nineteen
a lot of restrictions tak boleh lebih daripada lima orang ke apa kan abeh kalau nak kawan pun dia empat orang
kita tiga orang dah dah lebih kita tujuh orang kan so is susah juga lah kan hopefully tengok ah hopefully the COVID nineteen punya apa
vaccine can be found nanti kita boleh go to phase three maybe phase four kan
um macam bosan juga lah kan kalau kita kita pergi mana-mana just kita kita nak mingle with other people pun susah kan
ah so that's why kalau kita keluar
kita pakai glove kita pakai mask kan ya lah pakai glove ah
ah touch anywhere kita pakai glove kan kita pakai disposable glove
kita pakai disposable mask anything disposable kita pakai lah to prevent from all these ah
bag tak boleh disposable kalau beg disposable
ah cari topik lah kan
okay for me kalau dua puluh dua puluh satu my wish is kan ah
okay lah anak kita pergi sekolah agama he is able to cope
ah then other than that ah hopefully rezeki kita bertambah lah
ah apa tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people pun move other parts of this one is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family pun move kalau kita punya situation kan and got a kid
to jaga kan to jaga we got a special needs adik to jaga kan so but okay lah I think it can be done lah it will be difficult sacrifice perlu dibuat kan cuma hope to apa
hope lagi banyak benda kita boleh
kita will work out lah kan
the vision is clear kan ah our vision is clear kan of course kalau budak susah nak faham kan
ah tapi kata orang pun kita lead we lead kan most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out kan so kalau macam
of course lah kadang ada orang selfish apa kan so if
that person selfish tak nak cooperate kan
I will do it lah tapi kalau dah tak boleh kan
kau get into masalah
kau suruh aku handle aku I feel tak
tak ini lah tak apa tak adil tak adil kan so I will always go for fairness
leher ah
yes the neck tapi macam the neck only can show where to turn
kan tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang decide nak turn atau tidak
ya kan so sebab itu kita as a keluarga we are as a unit kan so we want to move we want to move as a unit
kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini kan then kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat
affect tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah then
really have to apa explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue lah kan so the issue now is whether dapat settle ke tak
tak tahu hopefully akan dapat settle lah kan
dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal lah kan I don't want to halang
kalau dia nak kan kita akan we are
in terms of nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap lah kan
tergantung it's very susah lah then
semua dah buat kan
kan kata orang tu kan
but now the organisation bukan satu tempat
they are two different organisations so yang ini tempat check
ah masa depan
for future yang ini untuk apa
ah dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain so
whether it will improve ke tak
tak juga dia different criteria kan like example kalau macam
ah apa in order to apply for example ah to apply for need
ah certification that he is autistic then dah pergi minds minds dah certify dia dah ah settle
then after that nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula oh
certification from uh minds tak cukup
ah doctor lah doctor or hospital or what okay so pergi doctor punya hospital
happen doctor hospital tu pun ah okay lah willing to help okay he did that part
then after that bila nak apply for apa for apa cash in life for home caregiving kan oh
cannot we only we only accept those who are apa
risiko there and the the thing is
okay lah macam cakap macam macam kita ni
macam for macam untuk adik ni
I am willing to usaha kan and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support lah
so kita kena buat kan tapi macam you try imagine
kalau lah all these checks
yes correct and the thing is pula
kita pergi check up ni bukan free
everytime pergi
ah kena bayar ke apa kan but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds tolong
percuma free
ah even the hospital one happen epilepsy punya doctor kan so there is no extra charges lah and
ah so nanti Q cure ni kalau macam apa
in order dah dapat cash in life lah apa ni semua cash in life lah pula nak kena assessment kan
and then the assessment pun need another set of ah check up
kan lah so memang susah lah tapi
ya lah duit apa
kita bukan harap ah ah at least dia improve
istimewa ah uh huh
I think for him is my target for adik is apa
kan kita bukan I'm not expect bukan expect dia boleh
pandai kan macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat
he can enjoy kan of course dia punya enjoy not
macam kita macam kita enjoy oh kita nak jalan kita nak travel kan dia punya tak dia punya enjoy tu
simple something that dia suka
dia feel comfortable sudah kan
ya lah tapi kata orang tu apa ye lah cuba kalau mana tahu kalau dia improve kan
dia punya epilepsy dapat
ah which is now supposed to be terkawal ah kan tapi
tu yang payah dia lah susah dia kan um um um um
ye lah proper food um um um um
budak-budak ya
tapi orang tak tak pandang dia begitu orang treat dia macam apa
tapi tu lah macam kata orang tu apa
treat adik with respect lah walaupun dia istimewa kita make him part of us kan janganlah lebihkan orang luar
abeh anak sendiri pun treat
macam apa kan kita try to make eh dia suka apa kan
bother to find out apa yang dia suka apa yang dia tak suka
apa yang dia comfortable apa yang dia tak comfortable kan
ah bukan setakat
ah apa marah ke apa marah
kan dan dia pun tak tahu apa yang dia buat salah kan kita susah nak
nak cakap kan
mengganas ah
dia tak dengar lah ah ah
um tapi tu lah
kita cuba jer lah kan hopefully everything goes well
hopefully is a better year hopefully boleh travel
kan mungkin short trip dulu
ah bawa adik sekali
ah dapat duit banyak kan gaji
jadi kita boleh apa boleh do
banyak benda yang baik lah bermanfaat bukan sahaja untuk kita
tapi untuk orang lain sekali ah for now
okay uh ya dia bukan friday sebab friday shafie dia kena
pergi sekolah so dia kata
uh kalau dia dah penat
dia tak enjoy so he wants
dia tak ada eh ada
tapi shafie nak involve
ya lah memang si june
tak payah mark sebab dia tak ada
oh over there got itu apa Marybrown
affaf punya bukan dua lagi tu
si affaf boleh lah because her
uh the other two they don't need to go pun
knowing si apa knowing si
dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak ogi
kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh if we go out I keep saying to the kids
it's just nice eight eight person the children saja
I mean if you don't want to leceh then just do it at home lah kat rumah kak ogi
one you contact kak ogi
then what what she say lah then after that baru
cause I think for us kita yang tak jumpa aisyah dengan
si kecil tu at least kak ogi jumpa juga lah once and then ayah tu jumpa kan
bila raya lah
think raya haji tak salah
eh buat juga lah
macam okay so it depends
uh because sekarang ni yang paling ramai is either mahir or amin
kan kat rumah yang paling ramai so we either go to mahir's house or amin's house
kalau si lina dia happy kat rumah amin ah because it's more apa orang tu tak ada kucing
tak so ertinya we cannot come one time pun it's just macam contoh lah eh
so kita bawa mak dengan si matin
pergi rumah amin so kita lapan orang lah kita jumpa amin dengan budak-budak tu kan
ah then second group could be andir dengan si mahir
bawa the children ah
ah eh eh tapi andir dengan si mahir dah tak boleh eh
tak boleh eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why kalau nak jumpa kena macam
so contoh contoh eh
then uh maybe mahir send his kids but dah berapa
seven plus uh si kecil tu akil akif
anak amin kat rumah dia so already join in lah
ah adoi ya lah but if nak have a cousin gathering then can
get together before ini I think maybe okay lah tapi kalau let say it is um
so uh apa all the cousins meet one time
then okay balik
tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu okay kalau macam gitu
anak-anak saudara jer
so they can't sit together pun I mean they won't sit together pun
correct kalau dekat rumah amin ada lah dia orang bermain
so to me biar anak-anak saudara ni semua all the children can come down at one time
mm asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit
kita biar budak-budak semua pergi amin you handle the kids
kita uh adults alright bye bye kita go for our
so and then andir selalu kan tu
so it's not like ini lah it's the together ramai-ramai yang tak ada
so one of my suggestion is that lah uh let the kids all kumpul kat rumah si amin so at least the kids
once you step out the house tak boleh
okay other than that then they all meet at tu their ayah teh house
ayah teh will be very happy all come come come
abang is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
how and what else can we do with mama
then we ajak mak
that weekend ah the christmas weekend twenty six ke twenty seven
so if let's say you want to pergi pun boleh pakai wheelchair kat situ
jewel kan dia ada all those uh tours right
ada waterfall lah
the the apa the atas tu ada the the apa
tak ada lah dia ada cakap apa semalam wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
dia ada dia punya own timing
not today is tomorrow kakak dia ajak tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want memang he already say he uh a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
ya that's why that's why I say so lepas ni she have to go to apa ni
because I cakap dengan dia
that lecturer yang quite good lah she talk to him quite a bit
if you he teach at these two uni dua-dua uni dia ajar
murdoch ah dengan northumbria so dia ajar
so dia kata memang kat northumbria
whereas dekat murdoch
you dah buat all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
err coursework lah another apa testing test
no she already memang in this line
dia dah memang buat communication so she can
officers came into the class and dah explain pun everything tapi uh
even that wira guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go lah
uh adult already cuma I don't know in terms of
and then now they tell us dah tak ada uh two time
all ah all of the ni ya
ya lah so for example the other time dia pergi M
tu actually not bad and I saw the programme pun macam bagus tau dia ada sound recording space
mana kawan dia atau overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up lah and say okay go maybe australia ke mana
practise apa maksudnya
that's why okay another option is tengok dekat malaysia
because malaysia pun banyak twinning programme
and twinning programme dia pun not bad quite good
anak ustaz ah
ah so actually we just limit it to singapore cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil kaplan
so with that diploma kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain
one more year tapi it's just one more year ya lah
tapi ya lah dia at the end of the day apa
budak ni nak buat shafie mati-mati nak buat photography right he wants to be a photographer
shafie dia once he is focused on
so that part is good lah he kalau betul-betul interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
bukan yang dia she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like huh apa kejadah ni so she apply K
uh anak tiga ke apa tak tahu she is she used to teach in preschool
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can macam
ya lah I mean that is not the whole idea pun the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so kalau let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources pun
you you go and pause ke apa
no lah tak you tekan the other side oh my god oh my god okay
oh he he message he say kak I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
but if if if cannot get the numbers itu yang ini kan
session tu yang I told ira ira kalau let's say parents datang they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session ah I cakap
because you can still do the assessment on the first day dia datang tu you can do
tapi kalau let's say dia
so dia accept dia P three still have to give the
if ya so on the first day dia datang
dia buat the assessment dulu that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so ira angguk-angguk don't whether she faham ke she agree ke will do ke tak tahu
I cakap dengan dia print the progress report do the apa
so that tomorrow we print out semua all one time lah so that's why I want to know what is it
I don't know eh to me macam it's okay lah you just print out pun okay black and white apa
don't have to turun you have to pass to the children
uh final apa the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi on in june
uh Kumon pun cakap the same thing
so he the new centre yang dia nak run uh a franchise tu
okay so he has been teaching when he was in um school dulu dia mengajar
uh part time part time lah macam uh he take up one or two uh students that kind of thing
ah banking dia banking so he was already working in
so kena lay-off
okay dia dia
but he has always been doing tuition macam his part time lah and all
orang serani so he he used that word you know he say saya orang serani he say like that I was like ah
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can macam
entah eh no nama dia chen kang eh
tu lah I have to ask the children how to sebut nama dia so is ya
see the it uh the indian lady pun okay
then kita ada two more options lah ya
and then we can also work on apa kata orang tu
nisa kan dia cakap dia cuma nak ambil kalau suami dia punya cuti falls on ni
okay lah tadi a'ah satu hari
buat kerja the assignment and all the
tapi err
ya but most probably I taking half day off lah half day off ke ataupun
ataupun time off lah but most probably I'll take a half day off lah
the company err wants me to clear lah especially pakai lah he
ya lah cause at the update especially besok besok kan ah thirtieth
ya you can you can you can masak first lah kalau boleh
ya don't don't buy two or three ikan at one shot and then after that keep for few days
and err the thing will spoil if you tak masak see like the broccoli that you buy also
I mean wasted kan kalau kau tak masak it'll just go to waste
okay lah okay juga
tak tak sangat ah I think maybe or maybe not lah
lepas tu ya lah

naik balik sendiri lepas tu takde orang nak tolong
tak ah sebab sebab kita ada banyak ada banyak masa
ada yang lain ah tapi tapi kita tak semua orang tak dapat buat ah sebab
okay baik okay let's start the things macam how's things on your weekend
ya I mean tadi ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid dia tidur all the way so my wife ingatkan dia can go to the hairdresser and then just relax kejap lah
you know just have a relaxing hair trim err hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that err because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before balik kerja eh jadi dia nak
dia nak one whole day just pamper sendiri saja lah so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this ah just nice also you err you also jadi to do all these things ya so K lor so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
err while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament punya benda
exactly ya ya that's my idea pun I was also thinking about that actually
ya so ya I also err not been discussing my guys err all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with lah err those that were in the semua tu
so dia orang kata you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when kita takde benda you know like you you there's no real cove lah
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
the weekly event and then just nice err earlier this week ada there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so dia punya format eh sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee jadi first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so kalau kalau all sixty four players masuk dalam
prizenya tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool eh baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus dollar pun tak sampai it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league jadi kena main each other for like
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches jadi a a lot of the the response of the company semua tak nak main it's like eh it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars tapi you know like it's nak you you enter that
only top three dapat menang apa-apa and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even dua ratus so banyak orang you know the dia orang tak suka lah all this thing ah so I was wondering but
maybe let's say like of the registration fees kan ninety percent these guys only did like not even half ah what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent tak sampai setengah of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day saja and then err we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves err ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so err what's that called
um so serious because we are our own clients apa
so you know there's kita we can just like borak have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them ah look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars ah because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time saja lah so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
I I I entah eh I also don't know how many people have resgistered tapi the the response I get banyak orang semua semua kutuk ah critics semua kutuk top top white center
now semua kata you know ni apa apa benda what kind of nonsense is this you know buat apa kita main buat apa I mean we play so much habis duit sikit saja then kena main lama lama how many weeks ya lah ada better things to do ah than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no tak tak tak nampak lain ah ada apa eh let me see kalau ada league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
namanya D to sports league entah siapa I langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
let's see ada tak berapa berapa orang dah sign up tak ni tak nampak pula eh
tapi nampak macam masih buka jer masih boleh sign up jer
a'ah berapa orang
ah belum tahu ah berapa orang ah kat dalam
tapi ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this err whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so semua orang kata like
so there wasn't even any one they say alah just go for the fun of biar jer langsung takde orang say that semua semua kutuk okay I'll I when I say semua eh it's literally there only like three people that response ah that responded
yang lain semua you know buat buat tak kisah saja
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab ah dia orang just buat ni benda just err make a few posters bilang semua okay eh aku ada league ah you know you get thirty percent kalau kamu menang you get thirty percent
tapi fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything benda senang I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
macam gray macam makan makan makan sendiri ah makan all the community
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event semua kan minimum or I think we can do a uh forty a thirty forty players so takde issue langsung ah
itu pun susah juga kan so I'm so I'm thinking at least kalau kita have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just err macam mana kata eh
every week ada content baru that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
actually nak kata possible eh
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once ah actually nak kata registration fee selalunya berapa
because they're by community centre budget no problem untuk dia punya wang actually it's free registration dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa
so it's just my masuk lah kan but that's for the punya lah um ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play juga then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that lah
tapi for all the events um what ah who ah they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just dia orang just bayar bayar bayar jer so takde registration fee takpe juga untuk dia orang ya but for us we add in lah as much as we want to we are we are okay with
uh how do I say ah ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think alamak one day registration fee sepuluh ketul and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way err let's say registration fee let's say lima ketul lah I I can definitely okay
the more people that join your prize pun naik gila babi
uh one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match kau dah menang tiga dollar
ah duit datang balik tau all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
dah eighty percent eh a'ah sia tu dah banyak juga tu
soon lepas tu kalau dapat masuk to the semi final top four ah
err so five percent each lima peratus satu orang lima peratus okay naik top four
ah kau dapat sepuluh percent lah sepuluh peratus ah
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
you masuk final up to fifteen percent
err mana percent yang
kejap eh so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four eh the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright naik four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool dah removed
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within err apa tu
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
matchmaking pun susah ah ah ya so so that's the thing ah then the list uh ya uneven
ya eh kalau tak some people get a buy then they get their money back eh that's not fair juga eh
thirty two fairly I think eh no problem senang
senang ah senang
ah tu ah
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing kan I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off um so that hopefully we can get our own uh third party sponsors ah takde orang akan kacau kita lah
falls the one that is working with SCOGA ah cause dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat community events sendiri juga
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that kan we telling him that eh looked operations side kita semua dah settled everything kita dah dah fikir masak-masak and kita boleh you know bawa orang-orang confirm register punya
you know tapi the one problem kan that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more err jet ideas
that is what N nadesan has been saying ah kalau duit anything with money ke apa kan with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford kita
tapi so that's that's the thing ah we will be working you know like uh together with SCOGA it won't be our event eh technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
semua ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway lah actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like ah people association entah apa community club lah sports club
south west ni semua so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this err apa dia E delta league
I don't know macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu lah eh tapi organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up oh okay so it's gonna be an offline event ah kirakan ah kalau venue partner dah sports up tapi it's um ah you know like um it's again ah
so basically SCOGA eh in my opinion how they've been running all their events kan sama macam zenway sama
dia orang just buat the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
our venture punya logo whatever it is lah eh we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that uh ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife ah technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event dia tak suka the idea of kita um how to say ah handing over the rains to another person
dia nak kita hundred percent seratus peratus ni event kita bukan orang lain punya this is ours have our name over there for and then of this uh
you know orang lain tak boleh kacau ah senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but it's not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
then they'll be like mana nama kau aku nampak nama SCOGA jer nama kau mana
I said oh now we work under SCOGA mana bukti
kita tak tahu SCOGA kita tak boleh you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if kalau kita boleh tunjuk on a poster that has our logo on it
dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa ah they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what ah err we are not not just mere partners or whatever kita tak buat apa-apa but
kita yang run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with ah whoever but they have to be partners it's not kita join dia orang we work under their name
satu orang kena start dulu ah senang kata
tu tu yang juga eh that
and then why I also tak nak like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside semua
tapi there there would seem a little bit of a chip ah then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor kata okay so siapa yang sponsor your previous event uh and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I tengok eh ini kau punya company apa
ah ha ha ha tu yang problem juga
but I think I would okay nak kata our community eh okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like um
I macam mana nak kata uh ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda kan they don't actually get anything much out of it
junior apa junior what
I think ya I think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag ah in the end
you know macam mana eh I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now dekat facebook eh all the videos kan it will show how many views ada ada ada rather it will show how many views actually
ah what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views lah apa lah itu semua tak ada um ya even okay right now zenway is live right now sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok some mobile legends punya benda
ya but I don't see any total views belum lagi belum lagi total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show berapa eh let me see another video
ah tapi the problem my my midnight punya shows ah
one play sports videos the problem with semua malam-malam betul ah paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang problemnya
ada ada orang but it's not that much ah okay ya I'm looking here
mm asia champions league semalam nine hundred views err asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
one hour juga ni semua one our cast
but that was the the very first punya lah I mean like it was the first
err but they split it into different parts ah macam part one first two hours ten ten K views
quite quite a bit this four lah but then again eh E sports ada berapa berapa followers ni E sports how many followers
aiman will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask iman pun can we stream it on your stream
or even better if we can get we can rope aiman in as a commentator juga lah
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that lah like how sia macam mana aku nak you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
jadi kalau kalau if there's a way eh for us to go meet aiman I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think kalau kita bilang dia look kita ini kita semua eh kita will ini kita punya event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money ah so maybe kalau dia dengar tu eh the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now dia ada banyak banyak event kan
jadi kalau kalau a'ah sia dia banyak events ah so I don't know what he was bitching to us about lah jadi honestly I was like dude ini it like it ah I look I know you're disappointed E piala malaysia of fucking meeting ah err bullshit I just said ah sorry
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity ah you're winning quantity wise those two guys eh other than E piala malaysia apa lain dengan other dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda
ah lepas
tak tak takde benda sia I can't I ah
okay I know that err see siapa ni matthew eh has uh has uh some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing dari bola tau so you know ah oh kalau nak kata streaming bola jer
dia orang takde benda sia decipher lagi takde benda at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa tau
so ya so he said oh I lost out to them honestly ah it's just connections ah you lost tau on connections ah that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E piala malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
because I know he's been doing singapore events juga
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our chapalang event tak ada sponsor takde apa takde benda
us sepuluh ribu views tau
you know err ya I also can tell it you know ah definitely when I when I let know of my community err this this affinity whatsapp group semua that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block kita ada ah aku aku pun tak tak takde ideas ah apa nak buat like to find my own third party sponsor semua takde idea langsung ah
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or err what ah macam macam kau dan aku yang yang my friend hafiz the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that kan
I broached either to him by eh nak sponsor kita tak you know this sort of event then kalau kau betul-betul managed to get them in eh aku bagi kau you know some some credit or whatever lah some kickback lah so dia kata
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage dia orang tak langsung tak support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
officially eh looking at their website eh dia kata ah they are a youth non profit organisation
kalau nak under official words ah
um ya they have err few initiatives lah all this err E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya err and they let see apa lagi dia orang ada eh about us
uh ya so apa ni executive committee
nicholas aaron khoo macam familiar jer nama tu
dah start lah then you just continue talking
apa like gold shop
oh okay that means if this COVID nineteen dah
is the laksa place still there there was a
mini laksa stall dulu-dulu ah when I worked at Equip
ya lah mak
oh the one yang mask tu is shah
mm mm ya because the the nama I always
your friends all nama sama-sama seh

I considered going there monday tapi must book in advance like don't have cannot just walk in gitu
tapi tu like you really paint stuff macam you see gambar and you just paint
I think they usually sorry lah to say but usually kalau put in extra hours they would usually pick the younger ones
but you know it's like it's so obvious kan kalau like the whole team come early tak apa juga
like there are other people who she feels better than her lah gitu
but I also think the the colleague yang nak leave tu like just try sebelum leave just try one shot like you think any possibility to increase my pay since I'm doing more you know that kind of thing then if really you cannot then just quit quit lor
maybe because you feel like aisle way corridor pun tak not safe
can check out art ground yang dulu whether they are open or not
kita tak boleh like impromptu tak boleh

dia no I find dia tak grasp the concept betul betul
dia cuma like oh I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent ah
like ilan is some one senang nak tangkap sebab dia
but for her dia punya ya the concept
then I because I at the same time aku pun spring clean ilan's room I threw quite a lot like all those also gonna throw err except for that cotton on uh paper bag ah tu barang-barang
so much nonsense and so dirty and then oh finally aku tengok karangan and the composition ah
tak lah cemerlang mana you know
even though the thing is like cemerlang for
ya the english one I see not that good banyak
introduction ya ya definitely but you cannot first paragraph jer good lepas tu lousy right
ya Mendaki is so far I don't know why they don't put like they are not located like somewhere tengah-tengah you know central sikit lah
lemau say
Mendaki classes nak nak join
dengan syaril kan
oh betul like really stay somewhere is it
dekat mana seh
kena write about it ah
wait apa eh
entah tak ingat ah whoa I must ask ling about this but I remember is we both were in the same group lah
last time kan kita kena sit sec one alternate right boy and girl then boy girl or whatever right
so second row is lee ying tak salah third row is shika you know
oh she only join sec two I thought she sec one memang ada sec one ada lah ada ada ada ada
even steven and vengkat is taller than you tahu
eh malay class why mia banyak bual selalu dia jer bual
there's normal acad ada
wan nuryanti lah dia dulu dengan
so anyway if I'm not wrong she got she already have three ke four kids
then lepas tu I
I know she was in hospital ada gambar shot
then after that oh back home lah then ada gambar gambar court then I was like eh like you gave birth ah
no lah we um we just like will comment kalau ada like nice nice things like we just see tu
she's the next class what last time when we E diorang F ah
tak salah I don't know
but dulu in school never really talk ah
oh ah apa eh dia cakap err
on one ah then uh Facebook I usually read only baca-baca then lepas tu dia
they say oh dia cakap anak dia ada boy
doa bulan-bulan puasa nak ada baby boy
then I asked is it then the thing is I didn't know she was pregnant right if not I would have donated baju-baju tu to her right then I was like
so I was like kau ni ada lagi tak baju-baju baby then she like no more lah dah all dah get rid already
mm dia also macam moved also I think
ah but bukit panjang to bukit panjang tak salah
I think he sells better lah sebab dia ada banyak followers
not nice she already said to the one yang
she rent out the the rental punya agent
when the agent ada banyak contacts and banyak followers it's easier to sell lah
okay macam mana besok
besok is
okay so is actually um in which year eh you nak get married eh
err you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a bilik or a room yang like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with lah correct or no
ya lah correct lah tapi sekarang I think you you both have to think what's the budget lah so budget actually berapa is it a combined wedding ke</malay
mm okay okay lah then I think kita we have to take a look part by part lah kan like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and um so basically is between like err in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need kan macam lik
which one you want to cut down ah on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say uh if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat lah because apparently like macam flat kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat chey sepanjang hayat ah
like I say uh the the most important thing is the the the nikah itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
um family support have to come in so that's why that day you all kena macam plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture lah that one have to be very like um
um very like uh transparent but in the event if let's say both side macam let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you ada your own plan of your uh I mean his side ada dia punya own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to fikir or think about i
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb tak so that is another another way lah kan macam kita nak um try to put everything in hand lah
so wedding time at least your side macam okay then for your side uh you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget eh sometimes kita kena fikir that in terms o
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in kita punya err orang melayu kita macam sensitive ah about duit ni so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families belum sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about duit pun kita adik-beradik masih sensitive tak boleh macam eh just bang aku mau pinjam duit kau lah satu ribu macam suka suka jer nak minta kan abang you know I have to be like more tactful to u
kak are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case lagi the other party yang your parents belum kenal kan and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you dah sample among all again okay lah kita work combine then okay celebrate buat combine tapi if let's say oh
ah you know lah I still want my one thousand guest let's say hairin punya side the
your mother say okay tak apa lah based on your budget kita invite saudara mara dekat jer one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
because there are two factors you need to think first um kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak because you all just become a new family member secon
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup lah tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh then after this the next time dia pergi rumah</malay
like macam err
tak tahu lah macam waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get err
and then july got a flat ah my kita punya timeline two years tu nak engage</malay
you know then tak tahu macam mana tahu bought flat then because ah because atuk said better
cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri then after that we are like ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle semua macam dah haywire all I received only fla
kita punya like dream wedding kita punya dream vacation semua macam dah flash toilet jer tu begitu ah so it's lik
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like macam ah my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
um makanan tapi kan shamefully I have to admit even I dah work that time kan I tak boleh afford tau because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like macam even like you know the bridal like you all have all these ah then I think I can only afford the photos begitu that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even hantaran nak exchange ah
um I think quite I I would say I like macam drag it lah but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of hantaran I think in the en
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay lah why not kita combine kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk exchange hantaran</malay
uh the equipment that include all the err the kompang and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so kita kena tengok macam mana lah kan so is lik
orang melayu kita ni actually err come with a lot of err gotong royong even though kita tak sekampung lah not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like macam pinjamkan kereta you know so when if you no
err how to say farah see you just like okay lah whatever people uh rent you okay lah something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like macam</malay
uh certain relative got this car whatever they say eh I chope your car dulu for the coming wedding can or not just ask lah
you know or maybe like dekat dekat wedding tu you ask becaus
uh dulu I in this case usually lah people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
uh we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar lah pe seh joke ah I'm not racist tau but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing lah so it was just like kita like just focu
ataupun early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out agak agak because by that time you dah start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly berapa one month berapa dapat sav
so basically you can agak agak already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one ah
this one take time lah but again uh I think hairin uh or or hairin lah siapa lah uh maybe is t
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because uh you ini kan actually masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so memang lah nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa lah kan yang mereka seems like okay okay tapi tak okay kot</malay
ya memang lah um to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like macam secara positive ya so at least that macam you know what you can um do best within this err
uh constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it lah so let's talk about happy things lah macam stress jer cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita happy pulak dalam pasal pasal wedding ni</malay
so kirakan okay actually that time you got share with me kan tentang mak andam like quality of mak andam</malay
ya okay macam itu kira not too bad lah kan because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like macam prepare and then both both parents are okay ah it's just anyway you also have time also nak save money you kno
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because um certain country dah already open kan so macam you can just like chill relax lah macam</malay
tak payah lah macam nak fikir fikir sangat kan then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house ah that's another advantage lah
ah ini pun if let's say both side okay lah I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like kita macam like okay jer like nikah is that correc
oh I think that part can't be helped right we all memang lah keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam happy happ
know you are like can can just like uh kita sama sama you know ramai ramai meraikan chey macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada lah saja mengeratkan silaturahim so I think can lah I think we jus
ah but now I think for now don't take it as uh macam sedih nak kahwin kan you just more like if all the all the err apa ni restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both kena bincang</malay
sebaiknya like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month macam kena ada like your own goals lah but if let's say if both of you like very nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want nak buat kan like macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap kan biarlah you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
um to prioritise lah then kalau let's say family kata oh no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit lah ah okay option one I let go the fla
ah that's another option lah that means to get a resale flat maybe dalam three five years that macam ah you know our relativ
some of them ada so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like uh just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
you know ah sendiri sendiri yang macam nak spend lah so if let's say if this side kata okay boleh ah can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
ah then okay then so semua boleh centralised atau pun nak separate itu another one lah ah because I thin
about tunang he can never be meet everywhere lah kan like macam semua happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation kalau let's say macam boleh</malay
then okay loh kalau tak boleh oh too bad lah because um either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
for you to uh come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor lah okay then if there's an option two that both parties cakap okay lah why not we bought uh you know yang</malay
norms lah sederhana jer like very minimal number of um err what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it lah finish okay dah tak ada lagi lah that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like macam tahu okay kita ada this amount kita ada ni kita boleh prepare macam ini ah then ah
orang ah orang mampu macam ini jer lah kan like it's like you know we can't be bo chap in everything sebab we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that err you apa ni</malay
err for you both all you want is just nikah maybe take beautiful pictures go err nice honeymoon then dah habis then after that focus kat rumah</malay
oh okay okay mas kahwin is err more important than hantaran hantaran is culture mas kahwin is agama</malay
ah so mas kahwin is part of the err macam dalam dalam term dia dalam arab is called maha</malay
so maha is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount yang kita dapat tu minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken yang kasi the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
ah you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which negeri ya dia orang lagi emphasise mas kahwin then a gift gift tu hantaran lah bagi dia orang ah that is culture melayu kita ni terbalik ah
macam ah gift tu lebih high daripada mas kahwin but right it should be another way but I think err mas kahwin ke</malay
err hantaran err for me lah I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents cakap tak nak ambil kan tapi the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way err sometimes rilek jer lah
err you can have the best of both worlds kan jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi important lah kan ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already dah pening kepala lah kan like very um you know so you you just got to doa for awhile rilek you know don't need to thin
err so in detail yet but at least to think okay now macam okay ah you know what is among all these things yang macam</malay
like you can because you think things that you can control macam budget photographer your brother ah these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of hantaran also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that ah if let's say for example ah we exchange err three saja lah item let's say for exampl
okay ah for example a'ah cuma satu I this one I don't know eh dulu I should have known luckily I never ah exchanged quran do you know that what is i
like uh okay so jada is common tapi seh jada kita tahu you will be used for um after marriage in when we play together but when talking about quran and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you hantar al quran</malay
you mean the hantaran</malay
oh duit that one that one is the mas eh ini not mas kan that one is err alah hantaran lah ya lah but some give cheque ah nowaday
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it lah ya if you ask me can be cheque kosong ha ha ha ha
cheque kosong what but inside is PayNow leh is direct transfe
ah so is all depends lah but again if follow tradition ya lah they want to see for real to sure masih cash you know you know bank not
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but mesti there's a transaction and PayNow
mm it happens ah actually happens during my time also is like oh because they only said lah when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so ah ya lah macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot tapi to know each other's partner is very very important so i
so I think like this uh family support is one factor very very important to me lah that's why err I mean culturally kita melayu is very united satu hati lah kan macam like kita you know lah we are lik
we always like um always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples susah even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also lah but the thing is like people also like sibuk and go and go and comment y
oh it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that tapi out there maybe dia pakai card card card tapi tak shar
per per per person or individual like that like macam tak tunjuk lah kan macam</malay
err like no communication with their families feel like tak tunjuk or what lah ya so that can happen tau macam</malay
tak tak tak ada then why you ask me after seven years dating pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke kan maybe all the while the guy only show up front oh aku ada hadiahkan best best you kno
ah dia bukan pun tak tunjuk kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging eh macam berlakon staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating ah but some people ya carry on maybe like for example dia partner no ah
the other party tu tak ada duit maybe tak you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe lah should be okay lah nanti kahwin pun okay lah macam sekarang</malay
um he has so many money aku minta pun okay jer ah you know sounds like but I the end when the person say oh uh he's in debt for the wedding ini ya actually that is not the only on
I think dari zaman our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P ramlee sho
ah lie lah borrow the chetty lah you know that that particular chetty will always just borrow lend the money to them what um high interest and then end up hutang because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family lah kalau family understand family tahu what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them wah very have good job then they get flat dengan with their pa
so there's uh about three months is like or four months ya tak start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
that's why he told me lah kan so like macam very kelakar then I was like abby you all gaji seventy eight thousand dah
then like let me oh mampus ah like that like that then he said no lah it's just tha
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like uh like macam peribahasa melayu apa the apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
ah tak tahu lah don't know lah there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that lah which I always think oh
to know you usually parents ah whether to let go kids to kahwin I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich lah right no need to be like so kaya or whatever you just need to have like um
ah more than enough like can start lah macam you can pay your bills you know you can you can uh you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
err want to want to buy a normal sayur or kangkung</malay
um when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my anak when all of you come to me my anak anak saudara ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision apakah your punya vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you nak make sure tha
you start something that with no hutang you know because basically you you start something with hutang you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know hutang lah kan you will have you got kids already hutang will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing lah ah because memang ah kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang ah kalau kita anak anak sultan johor ke daughters sultan daughters of sultan johor can lah
but the thing don't let it kill you lah that's why I said err in this case kan suka ke tidak instrinsic back breakdown tu kena ada</malay
ah introduce you must have really must have because if not lah if you ask me lah wah very jialat lah like every everything also must risau bu
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean kita tak boleh convince like that macam like for example ah you kno
fathers oh mesti nak ada lima ratus okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents ah okay lah boleh lah boleh lah sembarang ah he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point apa-apa suka hati okay lah korang dah plan kan okay okay tak apa</malay
ah engkau continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin
a bit penat
tak I mean like sometimes the
if someone is busuk and then like
I mean you think like the person tak mandi like is poor or what macam
abeh kalau orang tu uh

terpingin ah
dah lama sia tak pergi batam betul
COVID dah datang apa dah datang semua tak boleh pergi travel pun tak boleh itu pun tak boleh but a lot of people affected right
our friend there all err yang dekat batam semua some of the guides tour guide and then those
pakcik-pakcik yang bawa van ni semua amacam dia orang ah you still keep in touch with err all of them
you mean parking parking as in what macam jaga parking ke apa
kat barelang kan jauh but farming barelang I don't know but can do farming in indonesia what what what
dia tanam apa ah
ah err tanam papaya
and then those err macam seasonal like jagung now I think most of them is planting jagung lah or corn
uh jual pasar
massage mall shop is quiet very quiet takde orang
err because I think dulu dia orang harapkan apa
parlour over there err dah tutup
takde business
then dekat mana shopping mall err I would say
mall the mall is empty tak ramai orang
err like even on the street dekat dekat tengah jalan kat jalan tu kat nagoya tu is very quiet
I left on twenty nine october turun turun jakarta
jumpa kat jakarta then sama-sama balik err
balik balik batam
ah because nak jumpa
so they came from from from dia orang datang dari kampung
ah so jumpa dulu one or two ah one night then proceed lah
then before that you fill up so when you beli when you beli when you buy the ticket at the counter they would want to see this email
sampai kat singapore
I see is bila you dah after in front of the immigration tu there will be cisco officers lah so ah the the immigration will just go signal to them that say okay this one is like that lah
then from there I don't know macam you just wait dekat waiting area then all the all of you all of us will leave in one bus lah
but probably communicate they mention about communication wise is through err macam for me also I don't tak tahu pun where I'm going to
err they did inform ikut jer
I think but I think I think kalau kita tanya they will answer lah but then they didn't I think they are busy sorting out all the all the going here going there kan so that time communication wise I think ya
err nazi semua when you think of nazi is
not not until like that apa is all systematic what singapore
uh uh melebih melebih ah cara-cara the way they discuss sampai ah tu melebih lah kan jadi sama jer macam kita bantu tak tahu kita ikut jer pe
for me is fine but I got I got I don't know the the hotel that I'm in is a whole window so macam
I think they it helps lah dengan apa tu dengan kalau cermin is a small window cermin apa window kecil gitu I will akan rasa stress lah but but because it's a big window
so you know dapat tengok luar
tak stressful lah tu you got a lot of pass time kira kereta berapa ah that is what I do lah in the morning during err peak hours
err randomly kira-kira kereta jalan berapa banyak
macam you know alah you you you you you you are you are when you leave the country you should be prepared that you will be getting through this which is good enough that you get a good hotel a decent hotel apa
ah berpada ah you know some country another negeri dapat tempat is really really bad
for me is just alhamdulillah lah you know dapat makan you get a good hotel then after that a good bed for two weeks
I mean it's your it's choice lah how macam mana kita nak nak tu kan how how you nak nak how you want to make use of
what you have apa yang kita ada tu ah ya lah like I have for me iya lah tu lah kita duduk duduk tu kira appreciate but for me is that I got that room I I got that whole window I appreciate that very much lah
ah tak tak tak terasa terkongkong tu jer
ah sekarang jadi malas ah dah dua minggu makan tidur makan tidur sleep err
do my deliveroo lah but to do work lah so during weekend weekend nak kena kerja weekend we have to work
I work I work eh dua shift dua shift err either start at eight
err eleven so macam eight they cover breakfast kalau err
cover lunch lunch err eleven have to start all the way already lah all the way until petang ah until evening
alhamdulillah lah really really for me is that alhamdulillah macam you know you control for me is that you control how much you want to earn
you you you you know how much are you you know how much you can earn macam berapa banyak kita boleh apa kita boleh earn ah so if you you need that money if you need more you work have to work a bit hard lah
nanti nak kena fikir thinking macam mana
how is it gonna be a new year tahun ni eh
pukul satu pagi semua kat block agaknya
I believe uh macam neighbourhood ada dia punya apa tu bunga api sikit eh sikit-sikit sikit-sikit okay lah like that
singapore yang the officially close the border
macam the hundred dollars you can only take a bit a bit a bit sikit-sikit kan
tu lah that's why I'm thinking mana nak pergi
macam aduh
next year boleh after new year
apa sea aquarium uh belum pergi uh
adventure cove tak buka kan ah ah belum buka lagi ah aku tunggu juga
jap pergi supper dok just but
I think macam eh kita ni macam singaporean kan lucky lah macam beruntung
appreciate macam you should appreciate apa kita apa ni
apa yang kita dapat apa-apa what our government give us ah yes yes yes
macam how to say ah macam
dulu macam kita for last time when we are here abeh kita tengok macam tengok this year how come you know  mak dia orang ni everyday dia punya cases naik macam tak jaga kan ah but when when you are there then you realise lah err that sometimes you know it's not that they don't macam dia orang tak nak
tapi looking at their economy
and with azan lain macam dia orang kan kebanyakkannya
gaji hari then kalau kena quarantine empat belas hari
ah betul itu lah itu dia orang tu nak quarantine susah macam kalau dia orang empat belas hari siapa nak kasih makan keluarga
ah tu macam tu lah kadang-kadang bukan dua orang tak nak kan but then
negara tu kan
nak nak quarantine lah that kind of stuff
oh macam sometimes the government ada kasih until when the amount to reach them it's it's not the original amount lah
ah along along along along the way itu
ada potong potong potong itu lah situasi sebetulnya
kurang uh uh
then also masa err some of them
no they don't dia orang tak nak pergi hospital sebab
kita too negative
apparently for every untuk setiap orang yang mereka hantar to pergi refer the hospital get money
not under table is government government bayar so hospital tu hospital tu will just say you're positive
ah ah satu
I just don't know that's why for untuk orang local ini nak pergi hospital
ah and if you speak to most of them semua semua gitu ah because initially I thought this is full macam tak this is bullshit right sekali but then berbual dengan orang sana berbual lepas tu orang-orang A orang B orang C kan
they give semua jawapan semua sama dia orang takut nak pergi hospital hospital dapat duit
no they no no they they check they check lah no they check they they pergi swab test tapi came back is positive lah
but bila bila kat sana ambil dah negative
for them janji aku dapat duit sudah
uh uh takut semua orang takut
tu lah kan
kesian but kesian orang-orang yang malaysia kan
ah tu macam you saw pasal saiful punya video tu
yang sebelah causeway ah just the causeway tu
setulang dekat ah tu ah R&F dia dekat woodland woodland checkpoint tepi tu
I I think I think dia nikah kat johor
huh I think singapore I mean kat johor yang dia married
officially tu dekat johor tak johor johor mm mm
sorry dia balik
under spouse kat johor malaysia
leave dengan no pay leave lah everything for two months in malaysia ah
eh duit balik tu lagi mahal tau
uh empat ribu enam ratus I was talking to him I was I was talking to him I say
even for malaysian malaysian pun dia orang nak kena bayar I think two thousand plus eh
ya malaysia ni dia orang dia orang how to say eh kalau step step step apa macam like they are strict lah ah tempatnya I don't know ah but I think if talking about strictness lah I think malaysia lebih strict than singapore for in terms of their immigration tinggi
tapi tu lah dia orang
kat yang dalam locally tu lah
that's why told him lah you know it depends have to bayar but then
is good investment then it's worth lah you know macam your
ah duit boleh apa ah duit boleh cari but then the moment you have to treasure because
was thinking of the best if I tak if I didn't go back
maybe nak tunggu dia buka maybe two zero two two right two years
okay lah for me is for myself personally is well macam
break lah one and a half month tak kerja ni sampai sekarang dah one week pun nak kerja malas body aching betul sia body aching
tengah hari balik kan tidur aku punya kaki sampai from top to bottom
ache semua sakit kaki
no lah I walk I walk in the room lah five five ten five to ten minutes one end to one end walk that's my exercise first week play game makan sikit ah second week habis
makan wake up ten o'clock breakfast is ready kan makan breakfast
twelve o'clock lunch will come I will but I will I mean keep the food ah pukul dua baru makan tidur tidur sampai pukul lima lebih bangun jer pukul enam
dinner dah sampai
makan dinner pukul lapan
pukul lapan ah watch movie and and then watch movie ten o'clock eleven tidur
pagi bangun lagi the last two weeks last one week the cycle is like that
my toklang tu I got one page lah it's uh batam concierge
when the border reopens err ada plan ah this transportation
macam-macam I can provide lah because okay I was I'm inspired by my neighbour
dia hari-hari before this COVID kat rumah jer main dengan anak pakai seluar pendek lepak you know
then I was talking to him but the last one month tu
ah every night kita berbual then he did he he inspire he is very inspiring lah
so he made so he told me you know abang abang pernah nampak saya kerja tak memang tak pernah saya hari-hari kat rumah lepak
and dia buat is a
so dia bilang bang saya tak pernah saya pun tak pernah jumpa saya punya tamu so he never meet his guest before everything is done online
uh and and and he you know he looking at him starting from nothing tiba-tiba ada kereta ada ada bus uh uh is all made is all from from from from travel lah
I think I think for them even ticket tu rupanya selama ni ticket
majestic pun dia ada
uh then even apa tau
you can only extra biasa lah upselling ah kan you pay extra
you get express lane so when you come ada orang dengan your name masuk dalam tak payah queue
ah so like I was like bang try takpe bang abang tak payah buat apa-apa abang
I was thinking eh macam boleh belajar dengan dia lah kan how he how how how he did lah
oh masuk
when you tengok eh it's a it's a niche lah a'ah exactly exactly
someone dah tahu kan
exactly people get the idea right orang akan ikut because I believe also there's a lot of macam err local singaporean guy who got married to
berani cuba you know
all these different kind of food ah kan ah dah berani tau so as as as long you make it halal I mean is halal then orang akan dia orang orang melayu akan try tak macam dulu orang melayu takut nak makan ah sekarang
more I mean they are adventurous lah dia orang berani apa
ah berani try ini other kind of food
macam saturday sunday nak
ah ya lah but normally by ten eleven thirty weekend twelve o'clock eleven twelve baru order masuk
normally like that ah ten to two balik rumah tidur
but if I want to continue dapat lebih lah kan tapi for me rest nak kena rest lah
oh tu baju putih tu eh
kalau balik habis ah
ah balik
that's always that's always the case lah kan balik jer habis
I was thinking mana tahu yang mana ni ni orang-orang ni
oh a'ah ada trail lah
dari tadi ah orang keluar turun
tempat-tempat gini oh semalam aku hantar kat mana eh semalam food at nine o'clock ah eight o'clock hantar dekat bukit timah
baru pukul lapan dah rasa aduh tak boleh balik I I after nine I don't send bukit timah area already
actually it's not ah apa for us the feeling ah cause
you can see the people over there ya kadang-kadang aku masuk malam pukul sepuluh orang berani tau macam perempuan
you know the the the sebelah situ dalam dalam they will go jogging alone you know ya and I've seen like I think I didn't think bukan orang local lah expats kan pregnant at about eleven o'clock walking
dekat tu that that stretch of roads ah macam kita like night ah
tak pantang ah dia orang a lot you know
rumah dia orang astaghfirullahalazim ada satu rumah kat dalam pokok dekat dia punya so called dia punya garden tu pokok dia macam pokok besar
dia relax jer rumah dia orang ah besar-besar gitu ah besar-besar
ah pokok-pokok
tak tahu lah besar pokok tu no okay lah pokok kapas pokok apa yang apa tu yang ada daun-daun panjang apa
nampak kat ayer rajah boon keng oh dia punya tu kan
all the stick tu kan lebat you know like tebal you know
petang alamak ni kalau malam ni at night jalan ni oh
eh betul lah kat situ yang kat boon keng ah
sini ah sini ah kat colonial mm mm
okay so from my understanding right apa tu
the kadi is you book the kadi from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them apa tu
takpe lah it's okay ah
it's okay tak payah banyak-banyak then ya
oh okay jadi kalau kadi tu macam stay further but you select that kadi because you prefer also okay lah oh
boleh ah
tapi I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
oh I see that means kalau if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
oh I I I I takut what or not I takut go in ah then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend kan then is charges takde eh
tapi on that day is your date available already lah on the
oh I see so kirakan before the date available
you go in you select the kadi so err I mean you play with the form tapi you don't submit
oh I I was thinking of doing that tapi macam takut tersubmit then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference ah the the charges ah and then ya so but I was also curious ah I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very err sought much sought sought after lah so don't want to make the mistake ah then that time you book masa tu nya err it's a sunday
mesti popular kan but then err
takut tak dapat kan
dia punya cause the dad is bukan is a non-muslim jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke I think sepuluh then
oh I think about ten ah ya but dia ada lagi satu err punya susah lah pasal um dia nya kadi kan dia tak boleh apa tu
err kalau buat dekat err location lain kan dia nya kadi cannot be yang full time staff
so full time staff sana ada about tiga orang so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english ah so my err number of kadi shrink shrink then entah abeh sekarang nowadays I cannot see the kadi reviews on the web eh dulu got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
he's okay he's fast I prefer pasal dia nya dia nya style is like
berbual sikit then go
ah itu lah ada satu err kadi tu dia quite quite
very eloquent ah tapi bila I tengok dia nya video kan
ya pasal sekarang I know yang satu kadi ni yang I identified this salim jasman I saw
cara dia buat macam betul relax ah err he just
tapi bagus ah because you tak ingat then that means also no stress lah bila baca baca jer ah
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds baku ya
ya lah ya lah tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga ya
tapi yang kadi tu is your family punya err acquaintance ah
oh tapi by then you don't know who that colleague is lah
okay mm okay jadi kirakan my plan sekarang is to go to the website fill up all the details then tapi bila dia punya date available submit straight mm
oh tapi dia to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through kan okay
mm okay same here okay jadi kalau time slot dia is err macam mana tu satu kadi can have more than one time slot ah
okay and then the charges untuk err this registration ada tak
tapi the marriage prep course tak payah kan
tapi yang yang dia tanya tu is masa jumpa kadi
okay yang dia interview tu is
yourself your err bride the the wakil
the wakil from your your wali ah
okay so so sebelum interview dengan kadi is you jumpa the head of the first
oh so jadi yang dekat tu jumpa dia punya punya
oh and tu masa during that time will be the time dia minta to any prep marriage prep course or he ask you to go ah oh that's after oh
okay berapa eh
tiga ratus lebih kan I think dengar-dengar macam tiga ratus lebih
okay oh dia masa tahun bila baru dia cakap tak compulsory eh
huh ye ke oh okay
harus ah
betul juga wah tapi masa tu tak ada wedding cake
pasal dia single single layer kan
ye lah ye lah
tapi yang cake ni is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
sekarang nowadays they offer macam hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
oh yang jaga makeup okay
mm mm nowadays got pak andam
mm pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga eh
tapi sekali jer kan maybe before the dia nikah jer kan
tapi mak andam sampai the whole day mah
sama lah
cuma cuma dia punya masa tu thinking is dia nak pergi sana cepat so dia ada time to makeup lah tapi
for bride lah ya you dah plan pe
oh tu tak boleh jadi
tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh seh
kirakan sekarang ni macam they are macam err they messed up the err planning
some some some mak andam because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning lah okay
okay dia panic lah okay
kirakan flexible lah okay okay uh huh
mm jadi kirakan kalau macam if we do nikah and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
oh kirakan bukan pasal delay pasal they earn more lah no lah we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
tapi oh but you know how their charges are is like per whole oh not oh
mm tapi prata okay
okay jadi mak andam is not requirement unless you have err several outfit change
oh okay okay jadi sama lah I think for my side I think I don't want to have mak andam I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have err ya
I I even thought of what you know because dekat err katong sana kan there are many err salon ya then we thought err go there early ya
ya cause very close eh because yang grand mercure ada banyak salon ya how good ah that's why I have to go there okay
ya dia pun I email juga mm
most likely we also will do the same thing lah kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi ah the day macam one off saja lah
oh okay mak andam is for rental cause they got special rate
tapi of course photography on the same day is the best lah cheapest ah cheapest lah because you do makeup all that
oh okay so we do the nikah and the photography after that
paling senang dekat dalam hotel tu tak boleh gerak-gerak
mm ya dia nya swimming pool I ever went it looks nice lah so I think I need to ask the person on that day
three three err I think for for your case kan tiga jam macam okay ah very manageable
apa yang teething problems
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem aku outside mah but I can see people no space sit ya
pasal panas oh ya lah hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat err lawn tu mostly budak-budak parents semua tak pergi seh ah
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the nikah
for for my case okay lah terus settle
cause for for err the place I have right there's a stage jadi kalau kirakan okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the nikah start at eleven thirty
lagi-lagi kalau apa tu like what you said
betul juga tapi wedding memang ah orang macam panic kan jadi ada sikit problem sikit lah cuma apa tu
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my nikah so
nikah plus err tea ceremony ya
ya lah siapa nak ikut to the letter kan yes
okay cause I thought the nikah and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
kirakan I want to like macam eleven thirty to one for example is nikah tea ceremony and then
that's also the time kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar lah
okay tapi kalau COVID dia ada different kind of rules ah only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
err out of that twenty they have to be in their table oh but mungkin maybe masa tu policy belum start ah tapi I went to the Grand Mercure right and err
kalau ada COVID infection ah
okay I see but only worry like err yang table yang tak mingle boring ah duduk tengok each other makan cannot mix with the you know
kalau ah
pasal your wedding lain tau your wedding can mingle is a is different cause err your time can be taken ah you know speaking ah
simple simple hmm okay kalau ah
kalau if I
hmm okay okay oh I itu yang category macam err emcee ah yang macam too much lah that's why
I kena fikir juga pasal ni
that is one thing then ya baju you all buy the fabric then make at the joo chiat right
some more is if my date considered is during the syawal tau so have to do it early okay okay lagi apa lagi eh
pasal is it pasal melayu punya photographer oh oh ah
ya nasib baik dewi is not so
you ada kawan
yang boleh yang ada recommend recommend
for photography I tak tahu seh really I
oh ya pandai apa apa pose yes yes
kirakan macam know how to live up the atmosphere then ya
tapi the that time your punya photographer is the that guy is not that good
younger guy was good he was very err dia punya social skills good ah
ya tapi at least dia tahu I mean ya
okay ah terperanjat gue sial lah
err lepas the normal ambil gambar on the dais lepa stu after lunch or
cause I remember you ada macam speech eh tak ada eh so everything
tapi before the ending you all go around each table ambil gambar with everybody ah
okay jadi

kalau I pakai biasa punya or cheaper one is is fine with me but I more into like luxury bags
ah so one of it that is like my my my my my favourite lah yang I suka pakai
ah okay so beside ah luxury shopping I pun suka one of it lately I like to cook
ah so ah the cooking passion ni pun macam just ah
terbaru yang I macam discover myself that I can the ability to cook lah
so with ah apa the
ah with the time that I have ah may maybe the weekend and also the apa the flexibility that you say orh okay anything lah you nak masak apa
pun you ah you macam you I can try lah and you pun cakap ah okay let's try
we give me the apa the

ya lah dulu pun you okay lah not not apa your your form of exercise also is one of the hobbies juga kan
that was apa you suka bermain bola sepak
think ah watching apa football match eh
is ah very different between kalau kita tengok dekat apa
ah stadium dengan tengok dekat
apa on the YouTube or apa yang dekat television ah so for me I pun suka tengok
ah football match and which is zaman gemilang during apa the malay cup yes itu kita berapa tahun eh we were like
macam ah maybe in our teens eh there was the enjoyable time macam anak-anak kita will not
so that time was wah macam
pergi sana beratur going there
then apa duduk kat the bench you know the the the bench yang lama tu kan
dah tak ada cannot
sekarang apa stadium pun dah dibuat baru very macam high technology it can it can actually consist of banyak
uh apa uh spectators you know fifty sixty sixty thousand so
with apa the ability to macam so much apa
ah apa ah the good facility why can't we revive the apa
punya apa ah um
satu message jer cakap ah I be late I lambat
so macam oh so the apa kalau let's say dulu kan technology is takde
so it's like macam oh we will try to our best our very very best to be on time
and now technology tu memang bagus I I tak I tak no doubt
then again kita boleh macam ah when we ah macam sit down berbual sama-sama kan
we like eh dulu how can macam mana to survive eh

not not not so new lah tapi eh how we survive kita punya childhood macam mana eh ah so
or let's say kalau pergi tempat makan ah sekarang kena oh reservations
dulu terjah aje kan kalau ada tempat tempat lah kalau takde tak tak okay lah takde tak tak tak
kira peredaran zaman ah macam kita macam takde oh we cannot say that oh we are so
ah we cannot macam
ikut sangat pada technology nor kita is apa
totally macam ke belakang
I guess at the right pace you know depending on your sendiri punya apa
ah I I think because of the pandemic also macam it actually
menyuruh macam kita ni apa have to apa be more ah high tech
like if let's say macam kita tak tahu apa macam mana apa nak buat apa ah macam dekat apa zoom meeting for the kids
ya we like kita suka apa travelling
ah australia betul

ah selalunya apa ah tapi anything need reaction
ah planning ah kalau is is kalau hotel

need attention need macam apa kena tinggi suara eh ah itu I think that one I will step in lah kan
apa tak siap ke apa when we come hotel lambat like our room is not ready
ah ataupun kita punya travelling ada hiccups sikit kan ah need need macam
authority-ness kan ah itu itu itu I will apa
kena ke depan lah ya
ah you you lelaki you ke depan ah kan
kalau let's say I boleh control kan ah get my way okay then
you tak kan apa you don't need to you
um untuk keselesaan kita lah kalau kita travelling ah macam kita
we don't get what we wanted we pay you dah bayar mahal kan
is in order ah kan kita tak
minta macam oh bilik macam
five star ke apa ke you know for us it's like security

the P ramlee dia originally from apa orang penang kan
ah so tempat dia very so called macam museum lah macam museum
macam berapa tahu lah didn't didn't know that much about err apa this rumah P ramlee ni
and and obviously dia punya apa the driver was a eh is a is a indian guy
so dia pun tak tahu macam kalau orang local melayu ah different lah

tough gila tapi takut height okay lah
tapi pergi sana jer eh eh
senonek jer macam it's not that just a just a half a circle macam okay lah tapi kita pun
nak kalau nak ambil gambar mesti tahu the right angle so kalau kalau you
you ambil gambar the right angle orang cakap wah dia ni naik
macam apa macam bagus gitu lah tapi it's very small lah
tapi you kena pakai ni you have to wear macam protection punya apa
ah macam so called covered our shoe tu kan
ah and of course lah obviously you tak boleh apa
ah macam hentak-hentak lah kan
tapi yang kita disappointment tu pasal kita tak boleh pergi naik apa tu the famous cable car
itu we were hoping pasal banjir kan so tutup because ada land slide
bukit bendera the punya famous ah
cable car kalau you datang penang you mesti naik tu ah but
kita we apa tried tapi dia punya attraction tutup kan pasal land slide so we we cannot go
ah so okay lah macam itu macam really disappointed tapi kita dah like I said kita pergi pun terjun botol kan
kita tak tahu apa-apa ah whether masih banjir because on the news totally ah almost tiap-tiap hari kita tengok news
banjir dia dah dah surut ke belum macam we were hoping ah
tapi the thing ya lah kalau let's say kita cancel but there is no travelling restriction we don't get back
kalau macam let's say ah the the minister ah okay no restriction tak boleh pergi penang ah then yes
son kalau topic dengan berbual dengan driver pun one of it is ah apa cakap pasal apa banjir itu lah
a'ah kalau tidak dia kena pergi macam go longer way lah longer route
conserving atau err uh
and one of the attraction kita pergi ah yang apa the apa terbalik tu apa bang
upside down museum itu kalau orang pergi pun mesti because eh
err penang tu like I said dia punya attraction dia tu tak banyak dia punya attractions tu bukit bendera tu so kalau ah I think kalau dia punya other attractions macam all sorts of museum lah dorang buat ada yang macam cup apa
food ah food museum lah upside down museum ada three three three D museum three D museum so kita pergi I think about kita pergi dua ya bang kan kita pergi dua museum tapi yang upside down tu bagus
ada juga ah
kita dapat seratus eh seratus
tapi sana bayaran dia dalam malaysia ringgit bang sini singapore dollar so kat sana pun kalau dorang
charge apa ah apa empat puluh ringit kan bagi kita ah just about
lain cerita lah kan kalau let's say kat sana pun kita kalau beli makan pun in ringgit you know macam alah jangan cakap lah apa rindu lah dengan apa malaysia ada kat sana ah
betul ah
kita family of four ah
can be found ye lah
ah bosan kita tiga orang aja um kita ye lah apa ah apa
kita tengok kita dengar dari news kan oh there's no apa ah zero no new cases no local new cases kita macam harap-harap just make it zero lah make it zero make it zero kan
then kalau macam tempat locations oh dekat sini ada apa visited by COVID nineteen
so we try to avoid lah that that place tapi kalau sometimes it's unavoidable
tu pun tak boleh juga kan macam eh hari tu ada kat ion hotel ah ion orchard hotel ah ah orchard shopping centre
kita pergi sana kan tapi kena ikhtiar lah
what what we can do is that like I say we are wearing mask is one of the protection so kita dengan ni kita good hygiene dah mesti dah mesti instill in you already
ah so let's say kita pakai apa pakai hand sanitiser
okay then ada disposable bag
dua puluh dua puluh satu dua puluh satu tu ah memang apa harapan banyak lah dalam apa dua puluh dua puluh satu
bukan only bukan only financially financially memang itu kalau orang dekat singapore ni mesti
hopefully ah apa naik gaji naik pangkat
okay lah but you know we have to be realistic ah kan sekarang ni kita like I say still in a pandemic situation kan
secara tak langsung kita nak ah apa increase kita punya ah
number of children family members ah tu yang kita target lah inshallah kalau ni in dua puluh dua puluh satu kan ah
ah if everything goes smoothly and the planning is semua betul inshallah then we can apa
have a try another one doesn't matter lah like I said it's a boy or girl twins ke apa ke you know semuanya datang dari dia kita terima lah
tapi tapi kita mesti ada satu kepala lah
kan kalau let's say kalau you ada
you punya vision you tu oh macam gini gini tapi kalau macam orang keliling you tak cooperate tak ada kasi kerjasama akan pengsan juga bang ah so it's like you know kalau you know kalau your vision must be clear ah kalau let's say
tak munasabah tak adil ah macam you you apa
kalau let's say dia dia tak nak ikut kita punya apa perancangan kita cara kita tapi kalau ada masalah jer oh fall back ah datang balik pada you eh kau tolongkan aku gini kan tak boleh lah gitu macam bagi
bagi I ye lah macam you you ni apa kepala keluarga eh kan ah tapi jangan lupa isteri pun ada peranan dia kan isteri dia ialah dian punya neck neck tu apa bang
ah leher pada apa ah
ya lah ya lah so ya lah itu then then then
ah apa kawan-kawan apa relative lain tu anak kita adik kan dia is part of the body lah kan itu akan jadi seorang orang lah kan
special eh tapi you think
ah tahun twenty twenty one dia boleh macam
kita punya kes tu dia boleh move forward tak macam kita boleh apa dapat sekolah ke

time yang dia tak apa tak dengar lah who's perfect kan tapi tidak
kita punya semua kita punya goals semua dapat kita capai lah
kan maybe adik dapat sekolah
ah dapat duit lebih banyak kan gaji
naik lah inshallah
 semua ke
 bagus ah  macam gitu
 semua boys
ah  macam planning bar goal lah ni
 macam my cousin
four kids  juga so what happened was uh for them the first three
like just before university lah then  dorang pun happy happy kan yay dah  boleh semi retire
hurrah hurrah kan  mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
uh  macam gitu lah  kalau birthday  ni selalu we always tell people that you know ah really ah even when the adults celebrate the birthday kan frankly speaking alamak you know is really ah for the kids you know
it is really for them  pasal macam they really get into it you know  nanti kan uh  bila you tell them eh no need lah anything lah
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like oh must put this must put that oh must sing put the candle ah  semua ni kan all them ah
 ini topic eh I tell you eh I think every young adult ah will know this topic very well
kan kan  kita selalu gaduh kan
I think it's more frequent than that kan if only it was only every weekend you know  pasal every weekend kan is when you actually see tau
 kalau you  tak nampak in the week  pun kan  nanti dorang stealth tactic you know uh  behind your back ah eh  selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
ah and they will uh how shall I put this ah they don't even get defensive when you tell them eh how come ah when I was  kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
no kids uh but I was uh raising  itu my nephews my nieces kan from the time they were young lah um partly because for err me err usually lah I'm not around in singapore  pasal
I was studying away kan abroad then after that when I was working also um I was living abroad most of the time  pasal kena posting
so  selalunye not here so when I'm back usually
my  apa abang or adik already  duduk kat rumah lah  jaga
my  mak kan pasal my  apa parents my late father dengan my mak my mak masih ada lah tapi my father dah  arwah so I moved them into my place lah so when I'm home in singapore ah I jaga all my anak sedara lah
err  dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa err foreign service
ah  jadi macam err
 lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say eh you go ah ah then you go lah so to be honest lah I spent most of my uh youth away  pasal belajar kan you know away in university
then I come back  pun
out of the country the thing is  ye lah kan people always say eh but you come back what you know what's the big deal but I said ya but people usually travel I don't travel I live away
that ah that the big different lah  pasal most people kan  macam business especially you go in go out  keluar masuk lepas tu  ye lah  paling-paling maybe  seminggu you know
 semalam
 ini biasa lah
 tapi apart from  macam bonus  macam grade kan I mean  takde apa-apa macam incentive  ke or
uh is just to put ah  betul lah
ya actually ah your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend lah  pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu kan one of my friend so he was
uh like you accountant also err so actually  yang hantar dia so went to  belajar lepas how many years ah three years ya three years  lepas tu balik lah  balik then of course serve the bond lah
serve the bond buat accounting kan and like you lah also quite good at it  dia punya bond  berapa eh  enam tahun masa tu
not too bad  pasal pun for them  dorang habiskan  dulu baru pergi unlike me lah  pasal for me kan disrupt uh
then ah then  pergi luar lepas tu ah  balik you see so
err  ye lah for
for me a bit different so  lepas tu my friend  balik as usual lah  kita kan
you know especially when  biasa lah kan  ada baby then baby shower
 lepas tu keep up  lepas tu kaya-kaya then  macam every  dua tiga bulan you know eh fed up lah let's go have  teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue kan suddenly he said
you know I thought very good what no  ye lah but this is different I won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short  apa dia jadi nursing officer
ah  dekat hospital
until today ah  pulak sekarang COVID kan ah  pulak dia tan tock seng
ah wah high demand  bukan more in demand high demand  sekarang mengeluh aja lah so he saw already like alamak  kene shift work  lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday kan
err I think that's just tip of the iceberg lah  pasal masa period gini kan  kena buat banyak lah I think the most important yang  dorang kena buat triage  macam
 semua bila datang tu kan ah  nanti is uh people like my friend and his team lah then they check and then they ask them eh you look familiar ah because after a while ah
they keep coming back  tahu because now they know what to do like oh my back pain uh  dapat oh I feeling
kan  pasal when you tell them ugh my chest ugh cannot breath sir ugh ugh ugh ah then you cannot take the risk kan
so my friend after a while wah  boleh kenal muka tahu
I mean that one for sure lah it must be twenty four hours  pasal you just never know when this virus will strike kan ah so  sebab itu susah eh for your job  yang last time  tu so you say you cover asia pac  selalunye which countries ah
ah see I'm older than you kan so  tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when I first started on the desk lah so I covered all fifty-four african countries
 pasal chad is spelt C H A D you know ah and then djibouti  pasal starts with a D D J
so I tell eh A to Z know you think what ah fifty-four country you know A to Z A to Z so ya travel there a lot because that one wasn't posting lah that one  macam
you know  dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa
then after one month eh you go back there again then you go to you know um  macam namibia then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
kan um  macam gitu ah but back then ah
ah you cannot stay too long lah  pasal
so from that time ah you know  sampai ke malam ah then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work kan
so ah it's fun ah especially when you're twenty something kan  penat pun penat lah of course but you know it's fun get to see the world ah by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone ah I'm different era
you must understand ah so much harder I mean  dulu
then uh you cannot find uh where you're going  mana ada Google map Google Earth  ni semua right so wah everyone  cakap eh
and I always tell people ya you all ah think now life so mafan ah  susah lah  ini lah  itu lah  leceh lah you know but imagine my time I told them started work ah no laptop is this thing called ah desktop
oh when they  itu ambil lah kan
nah I I've been uh using until today  cuma sekarang supplement uh  gunakan Netflix kan  gunakan you know Rakuten View
ah banyak lagi lah sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two ah  macam macam dah  tak worth it  gitu lah kan  pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
 budak-budak semua masih suka Disney Plus eh
I went through that whole  apa uh how shall I put this ah I went through that whole cycle ah kan that whole cycle ah
twinx the magical fairy  ini semua kan that that was I went through the whole cycle
kan then you have to be always referee kan  nanti uh  yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband  lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else  abang ah then you have to be referee kan then when the cousin  semua datang ha  lagi lah kalang kabut
on uh handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them kalau nak tengok semua share okay
ah  macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right  macam mana pun kan I mean cannot lah you know when ipad first started kan I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put kan  dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
 macam kenapa lah you know maybe lah you call me jurassic eh  pasal I'm conservative about this thing kan  macam huh why is your baby looking at Youtube lah and this and that kan to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry  pasal dia punya lung
get exercise  tahu
 cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor lah you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying  pasal babies are
father of four kan you  tahu lah kan  budak-budak ni semua  bila nangis then you  kasi attention  sikit aja semua okay
exactly exactly ah  sama lah
no  pasal you  pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family  keluar kan
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point ah oh my friends  semua marah if I
say things like that you know ah  kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so  macam no lah you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures what
kenapa I don't tak faham apa-apa you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids ah
said  biasa lah
eh let's face it lah you know even we as teenagers ah last time kan remember when your mother  tanya score  macam mana ah okay lah
lost your homework  kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
ah tease out kan bit by bit and find out  semua kan all these kinds of things lah
no I think until you basically die I always remind people  pun kan you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them ah you are still ah
people over and over again lah kan  pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off  macam even  lepas I  hantar last time lah eh my  anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
although  ada maid ada  dia punya you know grandmother  kat rumah kan
but I don't think it's it's just you I think uh there are still a small but good number of people yang macam you and that's good  tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about  setahun gitu for one
you know take some time talk to them kan  tanya-tanya macam mana kan then you realize actually they are quite neglected
mm  tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know  macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them  macam manja-manja dengan teacher  pasal macam
dah lah  every day pergi sekolah kan and even during COVID and home based learning kan they see the teacher still online kan  pasal
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two kan wah  budak-budak semua balik sekolah kan
no more home based learning for many schools kan wah most parents hurrah hurrah  pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out wah
 betul kan
 ni macam shift work kan follow the time zone so tell the kids okay ah  tidur eh
ah  betul
or you can travel a bit lah take one day off to maybe  beli-beli barang boleh beli present kan
mm  beli present kan ah
especially if nearer to the school holiday  ke kan
 musim apa musim sejuk
you're lucky if is brown lah  selalunye kan is more like like greyish black  tahu
and then the other thing is I call it slushy  pasal is really that  macam yang that seven eleven  punya slushy you know the Slurpee ah kan  pasal it's
ah the colour of course Slurpee  lebih sedap lah you know
when you walk around kita kan  tak biasa pakai waterproof boots and this and that
and that's the thing I I don't like about that lah  tapi london during that period also nice lah  pasal christmas ah
wah  pergi london bridge
 empat-empat
 kenapa tak pergi itu euro Disney
wah ni mesti makan chocolate ah
 ni nak tengok that little statue of that little boy peeing lah kan
 tengok bola lah wah
correct  sebelum Grab lah mm
ah  itu lah
 tapi dapat tangkap glamour ah
 dia bayar itu lah family ah
your  kawan jadi super sub ah
ah kan  ada
for me last time I would go to manchester  macam a few couple of months I go up  pasal I was studying kan that time
oh  lepas tu nanti one of
not one ah couple of my friends  semua gila bola juga
then  dorang ada that time uh subscription ah
 macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian  dorang semua mana macam muka kita
so we go and we go  bukan uh division one  aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for  yang macam
 pasal takde big name  takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
mm mm mm I was posted to paris  tapi from paris I also cover uh three other countries lah I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so  empat
country lah  yang kena jaga so for me ah when people come usual lah you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget ah I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
ah  pasal
and  kalau pergi london  tu just outside  selalu ni all this uh
housewives all these  makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
ah  dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world lah so wah shiok you know so I was in paris uh two zero four to eight so  empat tahun ah  kat situ
 nanti nampak yang that  lampu tu lah kan  dia macam lighthouse kan every night ah ah so I'll see that light lah
eh  penat juga budak-budak
 naik stroller lah two of them
actually gare du nord when you  keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal  banyak kebab  banyak yang maghrebian  nya kan  yang daripada morocco  daripada daripada mana eh uh
ah  ada dua option satu you just  naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down  pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's  macam symbol lah paris kan so  bila
 bukan sabotage  bukan ada terrorism
 sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat  ni semua dorang touring kan it's really really
ya and I do miss uh living there  pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world lah you know without a doubt lah you know
paris eh  memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london  macam K lah you can walk a bit a bit lah  tapi after a while  macam
ah boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and  macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery kan
 kena tengok bawah lah  pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni kan
they got lah  nanti after COVID
after COVID even for me  pun frankly lah eh  lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore lah  pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly  dekat singapore lah
 tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice lah  pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my  mak kan seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend ah  masuk johor lah
mm and also  pun aiya you know  boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids kan like I've got even uh grand nephews grand nieces kan  yang dekat malaysia then its easy to uh go to
Legoland kan  pergi makan-makan
only be able to travel kan pergi johor and whatever  sebelum kita boleh really go out there again lah
know  dekat-dekat lah you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know um  pasal every day before COVID kan between two hundred to three hundred thousand eh  dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu kan  bukannye satu dua ribu kan
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right  pasal apa dia punya
 penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
obviously lah but also don't forget catered also for the johorians who work here  pasal
as soon as you hire one kan then  dorang buka kan payroll payroll  nye tu ah so  dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
ah  dia by two kan when you go there  sekarang some shops lah they definitely accept Nets which is good lah you know
 pasal even for their workers kan  lepas tu balik malaysia lah  nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up kan nak tukar duit
kan when their salary is already in sing dollars so  dorang alah pakai Nets aje lah  lebih senang
 tak susah
but you can tell ah  macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites kan  yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town  betul lah
is really bad  macam city square tu kan
um  orang semua tengok wah really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully lah it'll be a slow and painful process lah but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not  macam kita aje kan you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so  macam gitu aje lah
ah that's always good question  tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me  macam each one is so different kan so
you know ya  pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know lah budget pun  bukannye banyak kan even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type  macam
you know you just  ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know  macam you  tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you  tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of  teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did lah you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd  lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends kan ah so for me that's where it's quite you know
but I must say um not so much now lah but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me  pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest  yang dorang  baru jer  buka kan err
 orang asing you know so was a lot of fun lah you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
um fifty betul
so maknanya kalau uh kalau if you yang in ten years time memang you want to be in an area yang ada laut yang ada greenery where
kalau untuk saya for me eh I think eh
I would like to live in my own lab atau garage
and maybe sebelah would be my like lab apparatus ke apa ke
so if I have my own lab I would probably uh maybe add a telescope atau like some meeting devices so that I can
mmhmm betul
katanya if say let's say you were
martial arts gitu
uh any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and um I think it it it gives me like macam
yang satu orang ni uh she was actually uh she was actually trapped in a spaceship
computed her body into into a technological uh into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone ah orang sendiri tau so
so the boss memang memang jahat ah gilanya orang
like their their image you know what I mean faham tak ya so an image of them self you mean nak ah macam
ah ada fit body atau good looks
I think I agree on that lah sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun eh tapi kalau macam if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then buat apa lah
ya so I think for me kalau ada fit body is more satisfying sebab
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world lah sebab without without health actually um you can be bedridden and even the the cost of uh
so macam I think health is very important lah sebab without health memang you tak boleh buat much lah you can't do much actually
kena start awal lah
so I think one kalau pot from having a fit body eh
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind sebab sekarang memang as you can see eh mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth err among the working adults and among um teens
cara holistic lah
I think mental health also like uh stems from other external factors macam maybe overwhelming of
school work atau
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have lah that they experience so um like if you can see like the education system kat singapore sekarang memang very uh
it's very intense lah so like what macam
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and macam memang I've been schooling ah and I think macam there's a lot of
but tu memang
but it doesn't really appease them so I think macam apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but uh everything has been changing and revolutionised
uh it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless sebab apa tau if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you macam just just kasi semua on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
macam apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics lah and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion bila macam
macam susah lah kan
mm okay so contohnya like for now eh we are in the twentieth twenty first century
cuba like for example eh you ternampak a time capsule
I think that's pun what I would really macam really cherish enjoy
I don't know maybe zaman rasulullah atau dark ages ah cause um basically the dark ages were macam a period of time
the macam
rolab and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science bila there's this two brothers
I think it's very interesting to see macam
the the progression during that period of times sebab sebab during that time memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan idea macam gitu
during the golden age and I find it really interesting sebab how their mind
even in engineering and science and uh it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's um macam kita jarang tengok ah
dalam dunia ni sekarang tau most of the time kan kadang-kadang macam contohnya eh I have to um contohnya I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine uh philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once lah but I think macam ya I think it'll be very interesting lah kalau you can like learn
tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita just go far
sebab ilmu tu mana-mana and you can use for ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu
ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa as long as kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik and I think it will be very fruitful lah
um duit ke rumah ke
or war actually can be stopped cause technically um itu lah kalau boleh share but technically like uh world hunger among there are many um palestinians
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID eh macam susah seh orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang now orang eh actually tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada no access to macam
so I think um having a family really macam
and kalau ada suami I would be able to
find solace in him cause memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan kan so I think having a spouse would be very interesting lah
akhlak yang baik lah
macam I can feel you lah I think having uh having status
even if you want me to have good akhlak
tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal okay kita tak
hancur tau
akhlak is more valuable lah than intellect
akhlak lah actually even if you have your own
buat yang baik lah
you tak ada gunanya
maybe like um what do you think if you macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam superpower
kalau you ada superpower like you nak jadi apa kalau what what what will you like to have right now
kalau ada barang nak kemas inshallah lah
kalau you know I rasa
sebab kalau I dapat teleport kan
I takkan lambatnya cause I'm like always late kalau dapat teleport then macam on on the speed of light or even faster than that uh just like be wherever I want to be just teleport tak tak payah nak passport semua so I think that's very cool ah kalau kalau kalau dapat teleport lah
I think the current technology memang tak boleh lah unless kita ada transporter macam kat star trek ke but of course not lah
tapi contohnya eh kalau macam now's the kalau cause sekarang memang is in progress lah what what do you think of
phones pun is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
sekarang google jer
I think okay lah maybe salah saya juga sebab phone tu memang it serves like an educational purpose lah
ya and the entertainment purpose untuk zaman sekarang
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans ada this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things tapi macam they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very um like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think agaknya also I feel it's on the good side lah because
important I think apart from that I think macam humans should actually still take care of their parents and macam don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and contohnya macam
uh like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then macam mana seh kan
ada limit to it
I think one dia macam pun very subjective lah sebab kita orang tak tahu like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
I think ya technically macam you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world macam india they are very overpopulated kalau kita dah ada robot lagi mana nak letak seh human ni so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult lah sebab you have to find a contingency plan sebab memang dunia ni maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting lah to actually to predict and cause nowadays memang
humans dorang betul-betul kena
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even macam greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see lah sebab um some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
oh it was so much fun after a long time I tak pergi kerja then went back so met um
um macam in a small group lah instead of last time one big group
group lah but no more number of days dia panjang ah um james was the in charge ah it's quite fun lah
screening right they are prepared awal you know I mean normal
kerja dari rumah more relax they says ah then they say oh then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
tadi tadi one is from um one's from mycrone
if nenek pekik-pekik
because I told bibik to give anxiety pill early
I think nenek is more on anxiety rather than depression ah because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
ah so I guess it's more anxiety than dari depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit termenung thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then uh there is
and she started want to pray then she ah tak yakin that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
not um it's quite to say lah couple of days when she was at the peak um which is really really very I should say macam mana very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
her macam worse or ataupun dia punya um paling tinggi lah dia punya mengamuk atau dementia punya err
so as what you say lah maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like macam quite ah quite more peaceful um
um more macam if she she shouted yell and err
but not much and then err at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming ataupun nak minta keluar from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just redha jer lah ikhlas and redha
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone itu sahaja um from last time she doesn't want to be alone
hantu are not human
she's very garang human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing lah she's very scared the rest I don't think so lah macam people she's not afraid of lah none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
of course lah unless she says like stupid things lah then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans lah merepek jer accounting but cute lah she answer
apa ni merepek nak balik ah which is funny lah
macam gitu lah
what's your name how many children you have lepas tu dia tanya
all the personal things lah then tanya
um past then present then tanya in between so
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up lah so she macam ada rest and then after that continue again um
ya but the progression is like um the progression is actually macam okay lah people
um which macam mana nak cakap eh ah depression lah maybe lah
difficult for me to say lah because it involved brain and then like nenek they said that some of her brains already stroke
educate the caregiver itu lah
because dia orang ni sooner or later they going to be
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say ah eh I thought you want to err pass motion or you want to kencing and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that um
um professional ataupun ah
nurses yang
well educate about all this macam well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is err no the better lah no way I'm quite difficult lah this this this this dementia or old aging punya err problem eh it's going to hit the world
the youngsters educate the youngsters ataupun macam make it a point that
or anak mesti nak kena jaga parents atau there is this centre ataupun help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
kita kena ada this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
eh tak baik say dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik say tak nak jaga mak bapa dia
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that macam kita nak abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say eh tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that ataupun european europe country atau the america they find that sending the
dalam islam okay kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan a must
kind of macam err educate ataupun information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
macam preparation for the future for the future or
I think so because but mm but I don't think so they take nowadays they dia orang macam tak encouraged but they are
they have this macam mana nak cakap eh dia tak encourage tapi dia dah dah ready
I did in this ah they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you dah tua you tak nak tinggal dengan anak you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a um estate where a lot of amenities macam vast or or supermarket doctors dekat dekat and then err the whole building dia orang pun ada macam err
how should I say macam dia orang ada
clubhouse lah something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but dia orang tak macam
macam apa eh
have campaign ataupun macam kasih
tahu dengan public no they just do it you want it
okay this uh we have it you know tapi dia tak ada encouragement ataupun dia kasih macam I find lah macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
an idea ataupun dia come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system mah
they don't they they say said very err how should I say uh tak macam besar tau like very big macam siapa tahu tahu lah siapa tak tahu tak tahu lah that kind of thing
so it's kind of like macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu
then they are they are well informed otherwise takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang be bothered takde orang tahu lah um that's the problem lah
kita tak macam based we are free religious
other activity macam ah more of entertainment entertainment and activity lah you know of ataupun
old folk citizen soon or not far also but err right now people at my age I should say ataupun people at pak age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
atau plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both ada compromise both boleh plan sama-sama and both also boleh you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
oh what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the dah tak boleh juga
I kena orang then I know I don't want to burden my children um
kau orang share cari orang jaga mak that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday ah one of my children must visit me ah macam gitu lah
ah ataupun nanti cuti come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a macam sekarang ni eh banyak karang ni I see like macam my girlfriends
are people that I know ah they have mom which go every week go to every are of err anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu I I don't know whether is it a good idea because mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin is it
oh at this stage eh dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit is it good for her to change
the second option is so much better because dia tak ada burden others because you see ah
anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul ah children wants to but you must also remember anak-anak not the spouse ada anak I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then um anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya
peace also it's like um mak ni macam jadi macam you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you faham tak
unless you macam okay let's see lah this is
ah what I think it's good it's like macam let's say I ada empat anak I ada dua belas cucu something like that dua belas cucu enam yang very um macam dah secondary school ataupun dah pergi tertiary you know which they can help
you know so empat plus enam sepuluh sepuluh ni take turn lah take turns to um go to grandma house to this err monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then err this day to this day okay mak pula yang kena tinggal sana
ah macam take care out dia orang ada ni eh ada helpers twenty four seven dekat dalam rumah tapi err macam make sure stay duduk makan tengokkan dia the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be lah
rather than err kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis I rasa macam gitu lagi better lah emak yang in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
monday and thursday my turn okay dia ni wednesday and friday dia ni so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
other elderly parents so um I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in mak nenek into one station the rest all have to rotate lor whether dementia ke tak dementia ke pun rotate
oh maybe macam cik rosnah lah cik rosnah punya mak lah dia kan macam tu satu place when maid with with the helper than everybody come cik rosnah come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then err also so cute then they have this like macam caregiver punya holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then anak-anak lain have to sit take care
um so macam gitu lah macam pada mak lah better mak that way lor I don't know
lah you got a point there also lah it's what you say tapi kalau sebelum dia orang could are given a task kita kena educate lah the main thing here the the the role model is very important
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them macam kita tak boleh
um macam alamak this week I cannot lah I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go eh I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to um macam kita kena tunjuk positif that kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment oh I can't
ya true sebab masa tu nenek okay
but sekarang ni
tak boleh lah sekarang nenek have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is kuat takpe that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul because dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan
you know kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one nak cuba cuba calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
siapa yang tak marah even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
party must come out kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun ah ikat orang tua um macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid itu yang buat
um banyak terjadi didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this lah because nenek is actually educating me you know
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna macam sakit ke macam um
bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak lah banyak lah kalau lah sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan um
punya punya apa mental mental punya
our readiness oh mesti nak kuat
ya really last time I people always says ah tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I geram sangat ke then what is syurga
macam tu I can't even reach syurga if I do this to my mum
I take care of her not because I want syurga I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to macam
I she's get she got annoyed her you know ataupun you know I tak boleh tahan dengan dia then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
ah ya that's why I said because I cakap I dapat awareness ah so it's something that macam god is given me awareness oh okay this is what you need to do lah that I need I can plan compared
ah twenty four seven take care of punya
orang tua and then they they they now I have ah ah macam my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard atau by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to macam mana nak cakap eh a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not ah tu lah kadang bila mak fikir
err macam knowledge macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give um macam
a talk atau macam kasih volunteer atau told people or need help atau need advice I think I have
ya lah you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing ah technician go machine you know macam mana machine
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion dia orang emotional dia orang is so complex that we
don't know ah macam mana professional you are a good ah
it you'd secretaries apa ke all of them based on experience or dia orang punya client punya patients punya experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because dia tak dapat
dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay kita kasih penat tapi tetap keep on scream bukan itu dia tak suka ah dia scream sebab sakit perut you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being dia macam twins lah twins muka sama everything sama tapi tetap perangai lain
her likes and dislikes you know the err for the professional we bring it to the they I just uh based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event dia orang punya
err other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional pun mesti ada family members pun mesti ada and then um very important lah
oh so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the macam
ah apa they call it err
makan ya
ah nevermind just like grandma lah tak tahu macam mana nak bilang actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say nak keluar tak boleh tidur
you know she said ah mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa and then when we stopped her from going out the she said mak nak kencing
there's a oh sebenarnya nak kencing eh ah then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after kencing you tidur okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
err so sometimes kat dalam bilik pun sama and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place atau bilik is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
oh bilik dia sejuk lah kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar she keep on saying nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar then we keep asking why nak keluar then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us ah only if she could tell mak nak keluar because ah bilik ni gelap lah bilik ni sejuk ah okay kita tidur kat luar that will be much
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers dia dah penuh um
susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada some ah
crack ataupun ulcer ataupun sakit perut I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process ah cuma baby it get get baby kita kita jaga macam dia punya journey is to be independent ah kalau old folks kita jaga needed is to be dependent
it looks quite interesting lah I think kita should pergi like
err I think ada banyak ah ada tom yum ada
macam-macam lah a lot lah I mean we can just go there and see it's quite affordable also
pun ada dia macam steamboat then macam ada tempat you can masak macam apa ni hotplate eh something they call it
hotplate pun ada macam-macam lah
and kita nak tukar to andes pun boleh
biasa lah melayu kan suka barbeque
adam maybe kalau adam nak
so macam okay so because hafizah also tengah tidur sekarang so I also don't know whether dia nak ke tak
car lite I think a bit mahal because weekend then must top up petrol some more
oh tak tahu lah maybe dia letak air kat dalam
oh belum masih dalam bag dalam bag hafizah
ya betul betul actually kita boleh makan kat ni garden you want or not
mm ada fifty percent
mm selain daripada dining in garden apa lagi ada
I mean ya kita boleh ada alternative kat sana banyak alternative
oh jom ah kita pergi sedap mania
kalau tak pergi sadap mania pergi mana
katakan adam tak ikut
boleh lah
ya I mean apa tu okay lah kalau nak kita pergi cuba so our trip can be from
you know maybe bau jer sedap mania habis tu kita nak bicycle
tengok jurassic meyer habis kita makan jinjja chicken tapi kan that time I went to jewel um
uh ahad punya malam
so um the queue ah panjang ah lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward lah duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas so
I tak tahu lah apa tu um macam mana begitu but
ya like singapore memang got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated punya food places ah the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W baru halal kan
dekat jewel pun ada
kita kan nak pergi cycling
ya true also tapi tak boleh cycling
not really sure I think macam crab meat
shiitake cendawan shiitake
ya memang yummy
hari ini cheat day
K ya so macam mana
bukan B B nine eh
bukan eh
um K boleh ah
ke cakap pasal shares lah
I nak try lah baru try try I nak try stock then I macam rasa-rasanya tesla will grow lah in the future
sebab ya because a lot of countries are macam adopting err are banning petrol vehicles by
by investing in macam electric car company ini kan all those clean energy ones
the shares would probably go up lah in the future like maybe not now maybe dalam lima sepuluh tahun
macam bitcoin dulu lah bitcoin dulu also low kan but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance tapi I think like macam those stocks yang
yang permissible macam you know yang tak go against the basic purpose ah macam those thoughts yang deal with um vices then
you know all those macam clearly apa ni
that's my pandangan lah on this
okay for me eh I think kita kena macam
diversify lah our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like macam
uh wahed invest so this is a macam
only macam
syariah compliant punya stocks trading platform lah so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
commodities ah macam cash ke gold
ambil bonds and all these are like certified to be syariah compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in macam these kind of companies
you don't have to put in effort lah you just letak your money then you just
based on my experience dia punya fees is
tapi like maybe this is one
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms yang offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
maybe you can feedback to jangan invest in bonds
macam bank bapa kita
oh like betul lah I mean yang what you say is true cuma
I mean you want apa ethical investing eh in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
those the regular accounts lah me you have no choice what tapi that's why err you have to do your own research lah if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
err mana-mana company I mean mana-mana banks
cakap pasal investment ni macam mana kita punya trip ni
so dia punya kentut signify more to yes ke more to no
kita err
I think she I mean she's free lah it's whether dia nak ke tak
ya maybe dia malas lah tapi anyway dia dah agree apa sunday dia okay
ya mahal sikit ah situ
ubin mana makcik punya
boleh actually boleh tapi semua orang kena okay lah
besok tak crowded
oh so kita dah dah missed lah
unless kita pergi besok
kita pergi terus pergi ubin
oh ya tak nak
any lah islands or whatever sisters' islands ke batu ke bukit
eh itu jangan cuba I I okay punya
I pakai my army boot steady
we can okay lah listen to it later lah takkan nak busuk busuk semua but I mean take the car car lite lah car lite maybe we go in the day
then we explore these like macam make sense lor

tapi last one expired saya tak pakai
how about those yang tinggal kat at risk blocks
boon keng eh boon keng ada ke at risk block
oh ya I heard also from my uncles because dia orang cakap dia punya kawan pun tinggal sana semua residents
ya pernah
oh I tell you just story lah ya of course lah I mean yang paling err famous is their macam a lot of drug addicts lah kat sana
err let kejap ah apa nama dia
jauh jauh jauh lah I think ah dia tinggal boon keng jauh
oh okay lah lame oh nama dia uh
nama okay lah I shouldn't cakap nama lah pasal tak baik kan kita expose orang I should just panggil dia Q lah
no lah it's one of my relatives lah dia quite kesian lah so
oh so macam ya dia dia tinggal dengan mak dia then dengan datuk dia
oh datuk dia ah
boleh lah datuk dia close juga lah tak close lah pernah jumpa lah like visit
so okay lah cuma kesian lah dia seorang kat rumah dia takde adik beradik kan then mak dia mak dia doctor actually
I'm not sure tapi I think dia general practitioner lah I don't think that specialize in anything
tapi maybe eh if I'm not wrong dia specialise in psychology
boleh lah
dia kawan doctor dia kawan police
vet tak
betul betul I think you didn't mothership ke bukan mother's gossip
ya I think betul lah I mean like kesian juga ah like people look down right all these people tapi in actual fact right you put any human being in that kind of
environment ah I'm talking about the block eh bukan the orang-orang lah block lah you put in that kind of block macam lonely kan takde family I mean takde support adik-beradik so any human being will also macam experience something will experience the same thing lah
right correct oh ya kita we are going to sentosa on nineteen december kan

mm wait sea aquarium tutup what time
ah volunteer next week lah dia start tak tahu lah apa dia buat but ah like I told you lah we we started with the orientation online because sekarang we are still in the phase
copyright copyrighting untuk uh tak tahu apa lah dia punya social media punya page lah
tak pergi mana-mana lah this is online because right now we are still in phase two um so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society punya volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines sekarang uh because people you know cannot meet
tak tahu ah all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online sedih engkau kau tengok
can do lah macam so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for macam design uh photography
uh they have macam a knitting crochet with the patients but sekarang takde lah pasal you know it's it's uh only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things ah cancer society they've been around for a long time jadi so they they're very established in the community
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously susah
um but they tried uh I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is uh the apa tu nama dia awareness uh campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these macam cakap cakap pasal
uh ramai orang macam takut nak buat cancer screening because of course takut lah macam people takut nak buat cancer screening
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot lah ya so macam gitu lah ya I'm looking
forward to it lah honestly something I've been wanting to do for a macam dah lama gitu so uh ya inshaallah I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
no next week they will give me the um they have something in mind I think uh ya and then macam I'll just
tengok lah kalau kalau boleh tolong then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
uh but of course they ask that eh no kalau once you commit you have to do it ah bukan macam suka-suka macam this week buat next week tak nak buat ya
you know next year when they start doing uh the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year bila
okay so what they do is on the form in uh apa apa tu during the four main religious group punya holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
hari raya dengan like deepavali
I think now dia tak buat apa-apa lah this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have uh all volunteers come together and kita macam pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have ang pao
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is macam tak boleh afford treatment and then balik rumah rumah macam gitu and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them um like grants and and you know money like contributions uh so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year orang datang like people have to come to them to collect the ang pao um but this may be depending on uh whether or not phase three starts next year lah um I don't know whether that's going to happen ke tak ya so that's next year
kalau tidak boring aje kan buat remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
ya why not kenapa tak boleh
oh ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the uh programs where volunteers kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah tau
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean macam banyak macam program program lah you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya um ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then balik they are both
too penat uh the but um macam especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
kemaskan rumah they showed like one house macam eh kesian lah I tengokkan like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just makanan bawa pergi rumah dia
and stuff like that lah so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have macam apa tu volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
a'ah macam gitu
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract untuk apa kan and it's really up to you
but buat apa ni
but but wait the dogs dari mana
the dogs kat mana
the one dekat
tengah oh ah dekat ya that's true
ini because of the uh apa ni benda ni ah
even with the ini the dogs and the cats
like dog walker pun tak boleh
ambassador ni untuk apa
untuk for like companies lah
ambil gambar apa oh okay
so the fosterers untuk anjing-anjing kucing-kucing like is it is it only untuk the dogs or untuk kucing-kucing also
so when you say volunteer with doing this maknanya you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you bayar untuk semua bende ni semua
so who pays for punya clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
wow that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up macam sekarang dah macam
ada lah duit sikit gitu lah
G O V ni apa
what is the nama oh okay
iya lah charity lah I mean they don't expect the government nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit government gets the money dari kita taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the orang-orang
apa masalah if you if the government don't have enough money to macam apa tu cakap
to give macam to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of kasih anjing-anjing
apa punya development
mana kita ada jungle what we don't have any jungle
but do you all know you know as volunteers of uh and working in this working in this uh apa tu dia sector does the government actually have a plan uh when when macam like they go now kat belakang ni like there's this
tengah tengah this new development kat tengah kat belakang sini
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a macam apa tu cakap
bukan contingency lah tapi macam plan lah like a plan when they develop these new lands
but they've been developing singapore for how long takkan lah macam sampai sekarang tak tahu
mm pasir ris pun ada babi
but how can it be macam gini like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if macam kita baru start nak develop lands or takeover lands it's been macam we've been we've been building
and and other housing since bila kita punya independence nineteen sixties ah
so that's only the dogs because I know dekat pasir ris when I went uh pasir park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
ya because recently kan ada perempuan tu yang kena attack tu
eh kau punya kerusi ni gatal seh
gatal lor
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay jangan duduk situ
kesian spoke but so what what happens so who
uh tapi it's been there for awhile dengan macam
terus kasih lah I always said that
tapi so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the apa anjing-anjing kan I can see
and the uh siapa nama tu
who takes care who is supposed to because kat sini I've seen satu just one snake and
apa ACRES
he's a syrian refugee dia tinggal dekat lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways ah cakap macam gitu
so no honestly uh apa cakap ular-ular
it's not as easy as oh nampak anjing oh uh nampak babi we can see it we can you know some kind of action the ular ni you know macam kat bawah-bawah and then in the longkang-longkang you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but eh takut
uh snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about uh ular macam ular coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen satu kat sini
and and then dia macam masuk dalam longkang and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to macam takut uh because I can't I betul betul there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh so
so the thing is dekat here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the um the stray dogs there is a family of three kadang-kadang macam during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
one auntie dia um auntie tinggal kat tak tahu block mana she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that uh dulu dia kena saman because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about macam people feeding uh stray cats or stray dogs but auntie ni sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food untuk she feeds a lot of stray cats macam she brings macam besar you know macam orang-orang macam ini um
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting um for dia dia cakap dia kena
kena saman so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
tak tahu lah auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie sekarang pun nak kena she has to be careful because she also puts out uh
air untuk kucing-kucing ni so the problem is our area kat sini is a high dengue area
what do you mean two hours to clear siapa yang pergi check
siapa yang nak catch
what do you mean walk past lepas tu kena fine tak boleh feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours ni
how do they know macam who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
um tapi kau duduk situ so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
mesti clear lah
tapi dia the feeder mesti clear makanan tu
ah because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and a'ah betul ya that's true
lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia how much is the saman
takde lah mana ada kat sini signs
ya but the the cats kat sini bagus juga lah and honestly the cats around here gemuk-gemuk because of macam auntie macam gini and this
eh apa kat belakang ni there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same kat sini so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute nama dia sausage aku kasih nama jer lah so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
sampai uh auntie kat bawah ni you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window um I can see someone else coming there's another man kat dia tinggal kat I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage ni honestly I've never seen stray cats
I mean uh macam the the
size tu macam comparable to a domestic cat like a cat punya kat kat rumah orang ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of kat sini I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
have run away dulu we used to see more of the dogs
uh during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because takde orang keluar kan
so I saw them dia selalu tidur under the this lorry because orang pun tak kerja so they were like always sleeping the three of them
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the kucing but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one betul I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore uh anjing tak dah takde lagi
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had kat depan ni right in front here there's these two big palm trees kan so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood macam this um once or twice we've seen them along the macam apa tu the park connector here at bukit batok going up to clementi but they came here the whole there were like there first of all dia hantar satu agaknya macam scout came scout nampak pokok ni scout stayed there so I took gambar lah dengan camera tu and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the apa ni I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was dekat apa jalan dekat park connector tu I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big longkang
they are so you see kat sana ada the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is keluar pergi
jalan you know everybody suddenly everybody pergi uh exercise so in that apa tu nama dia longkang the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the animals crossing the path tak ada lagi during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
uh but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop um and they would do their swimming swimming but tu macam exhibitionist tau the otters are huge exhibitionists
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the longkang where did they go to the uh the botanic garden
so they came out macam every night
tak tahu lah
but they're not the ones yang kat dalam longkang ni they're not that big dekat sini kat park connector the one that goes up to pandan
jangan bedek lah kau cakap different family different types lah
what do you mean mana ada clan
macam apa clan
eh kau jangan tipu lah macam mana boleh gini
eh kau macam eh kau jangan bedek lah I mean sorry this is not
like on the ground macam they go and macam nak nak pergi cari
ah okay like like the people who go sungei buloh cari burung cari burung ah okay okay okay
but they all look the same apa macam mana nak ada divide
so the one yang that I say kat sini
during the circuit breaker kan so I read about the one yang
so do they macam pindah from one place to another or when you say dia orang macam this otter clan kallang clan do they just live there atau macam
they come kat sini to look for the
bukit batok clan what what I honestly don't understand macam mana ni
lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana of course you have to look for orang lain kan
lepas tu sekarang macam mana where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so macam do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and dia orang macam what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
macam during the circuit breaker macam okay so that one whole family keluar pergi serangoon road nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa eh when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just macam duduk kat situ aje
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes kat sini in the drain
how did the otters from macam botanic gardens pergi
kat sini like bukit batok because there is a whole we we see a lot in bukit batok at the park connector in the longkang
like do they get tagged by apanya nama dia ACRES
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about macam on social media pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk all the otters knew there was once kat clementi uh near sixth avenue that big longkang
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the apa longkang besar
um but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it macam a new development that they came from somewhere
eh kau jangan bawa telephone kau masuk toilet boleh nanti orang dengar
kau can you please not macam gini this lucah can you please close the door
so ya that's what I'm saying because dulu I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya lah wildlife ya lah of course aware but takkan lah what I'm saying is takkan lah dulu honestly I mean I grew up in kampung we did not hear about all these otters during kampung dulu kampung banyak benda of course we had the monyet we actually had the monyet uh then
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in kampung but we had the big longkang-longkang
so takkan lah I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the macam the public's consciousness
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged macam apa tu namanya microchipped
do they no I mean when you say they care for them bukan macam it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at macam you can't walk the otter
in singapore do they have them macam untuk ular-ular
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore kan I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at macam just hiding away and going into the longkang
but how do you macam if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the longkang then it just disappears
oh I I remember dulu dekat the the kat mana tu I don't know what lah it was in the news was it a python
so what happens when ACRES comes when apa the the snake now it has the
kucing the kucing is in the perut
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else kan tak kan macam redhill kat bawah block tak kan you you can't just leave it there
not that not that crunchy right compared to but still very nice especially the kentang the whipped potato
okay lah tak tak sedap sangat ah to my taste
okay lah both I think preference wise I tak choosy ah both
sedap very crunchy very nice I think it depends on your mood hari tu kalau you rasa your taste
ah okay lah christmas eve lah christmas christmas dah nak dekat seh nak boleh order dia punya christmas bundle I'm looking for turkey ataupun lamb shank

mm fabric paint mahal ke
lebih banyak save kalau nak beli tapi kalau kalau unless if you thought of doing colouring masks tu nak jual to your friend ke you can promote dekat mana then worth buying the fabric mask ah you can give it a try then you can do your art to show off dekat kau punya mask tu pelitup muka kau

we cannot include bonuses or semua tu tak boleh let's just take it as that thing tak ada ya you just depend on your that one only your your monthly salary
that's all because cannot lah because if you think of something that haven't come sekali betul-betul tak ada ah macam sekarang ni bonus tak ada
I don't know I I talk to my kids so err apa tu
we we talk about like okay now that we have only one person working kan so aku tak aku tak boleh ah selalu keluar makan ke apa benda but alhamdulillah
my expending maybe might over spending I stop I don't have so whatever allowances I have is err strictly untuk bayar bill mm dengan bayar apa-apa lah macam dia punya ngaji ke apa benda tu semua then err kereta aku tak bayar lagi that that time kereta is my responsibility so kereta semua dia dia yang bayar sekarang and then ah he take only lah that's that's why he he he drive to work also which is good lah because now raining season I I prefer him to drive then
masih ah motor tu takde don't need to pay already so it it it's has no financial burden lah ah it's just petrol only so no financial burden to me is fine you know we can keep it
actually tak ya at at first I I I I was thinking about ya lah financially we are still quite a burden but after that I was like I have to stop worrying ah you know
ah the break times that is like already given like when you are going to work you can just grab breakfast anywhere kau pergi kerja then after that if it's lunch break ah ya lah is lunch break ah nobody is working what semua orang nak keluar makan lunch then after that it's the end of the day of the work day kau balik
I think I eat like what dinner pukul lapan I didn't eat breakfast my breakfast is coffee
then after that aku lupa nak makan
eh jemput minum so my breakfast is just coffee so laki aku cakap you have to look after your health is not that I do not want to look after my health is really tak ada masa ya
dorangnya buku sekolah lah lah buku madrasah lah apa benda nak kena beli
dah sec four hairi ah secondary ah
that's the first choice ya second choice is bukit panjang actually dia punya
dia punya aggregate is ah
in between err normal academic and express he can go to express but if you want to go to an express class he have to go to the the sekolah yang
yang tak best sikit lah
like teck whye secondary which we don't kita tak nak that's the only school that is nearby us that we never choose
laki aku tak suka lah dia punya um
ah ya so the neighbourhood dia tak suka jadi dia cakap cannot other school boleh dapat normal academic pun takpe tapi tak boleh
any school lah any school that we choose tu boleh
pasal sekolah eh tak pasal kau punya kerja eh actually dia dah macam dah branch out dah
eh tapi aku tak faham ah kau punya kerja buat apa
jual besi dah dia punya sales really drop ah
kerja kau ni macam mak mertua aku ah
kau jual besi mak mertua aku ah mak mertua aku jual itu ah ya
right not enough experience lah tu
but your work wise memang dah
kau tak boleh function ah how to function
macam lyn ah sama
asam orh kunyit ah but tapi kunyit hidup ah jangan pakai kunyit powder
kunyit hidup aku baru buat aku aku aku blend ah ah I blend kunyit
and then I put in one one container then I blend ginger put in one container so anytime you want to drink like err ginger lemon ke apa kan mm then you just take lah
letak air panas letak lemon letak honey habis cerita
to me deep station err dia punya tu terlalu
ya because dia letak garlic juga apa right
the lemon grass no dia dia macam blend benda untuk masak kau faham ah tu yang pada aku macam tak tak best
aku ya I always mix with water then I just drink it as a shot
that one is for what buat bangun pagi jadi perut kempis
you see ah that is the old people thinking you know if you watch if you watch the err those yang health punya shows kan the health shows yang melayu punya tau
terus cakap eh this one is all
it doesn't matter minum air sejuk ke tidak it does not affect your system
so macam aku aku kan ada yang that package that time err urut kat tempat err tempat cina punya
urut ah then dia urut-urut aku dia cakap oh you shouldn't be drinking too much err cold water your inside ah sorry china kan china women so dia cakap your inside is very wet aku dah ketawa of course lah my inside very wet kan darah kalau dry I die already your inside is very wet
aku tak faham apa maksud dia very wet
but then dia nak cakap aku punya tu sejuk ke apa system aku sejuk ke aku pun tak tahu I think it ya lah I think is a problem ah because aku kadang-kadang macam minum air sejuk banyak sangat kan kaki aku sakit seh
well haus nyah
aku tengah menyusu haus tau
serious lah kalau dah artiste mesti lah better
ya you add in that one lah like those floral floral things you know like the chrysanthemum ke bunga rose ke the dried rose ah they say is good for complexion
ah can ah it's easy it's easy to get what anywhere just add in aje tak payah letak gula it's just to flavour your your air
semua masuk gasak ah
tu ah kan cakap mak-mak ni berbual ada jer daripada satu topic branch out
kalau betul dapat is fifty dollars fifty
okay lah buat
macam laki aku buat ah that time aku tak tahu eh so one of the years birthday aku dia kasi aku ni
ni lah ni apple apa ni apple pay ah
aku tak tahu pasal that time kita baru masing-masing masih kerja like still very new kind
experiment kena kasi darah
ah tapi dia kasi darah I think a lot ah then have to come like couple of times ah so
sumpah aku tak tahu nyah so he say because of that then they pay me to be the experiment punya person so the money I get I buy this one lah wah sweet lah sangat touched touched lah banyak-banyak
lama anak aku masih kecil lagi dua-dua aku masih belum ada hasif masih tak ada
eh dia takut jarum ah aku tu yang aku hairan
for all my pregnancies the man have to come to to take their blood or whatever right dia takut gila jarum kecil macam gitu pun dia takut huh the err they check blood right
mother and father punya blood or something ya ya ya hmm
even like at work if he has to do the um flu jabs right he always decline then I say why it's err it's compulsory he's like no it's it's not it's not compulsory so that's why I always reject uh huh anyway dia cakap anyway dia berbual dengan dia punya nurse um the nurse told me not all flu jabs are
what's that word no no no not murah it's free what they they already have to take it not all flu jabs are effective
because the certain flu jabs are for certain types of flu string so sometimes you can you can take the flu jab already and then the next few months you have flu which but it is cause by different string ah dia tak effective jadi dia cakap if not effective what for I take don't need to take ah
siao because to me to me pada aku you should take it because you are facing all these people all the prisoners all the visitors coming in and out test ya took twice
actually nowadays dulu aku aku dulu macam aku gung-ho ah tak takut tapi lepas tu ah
sensitive makin takut
kalah bising ah
sekarang dia dah start jalan kan jadi rumah aku berselerak ah
ye lah
I don't mind berselerak sometimes but
diri kau sendiri lah
I know lah it's good but you see ah I'm I'm dealing with different cases already macam kau aku rasa ian is very well behaved
I have all the phases that's the problem that's why I aku macam stressed because I have one boy I have one eh actually ah this conversation do we need to speak singlish or not
no need eh nevermind ah
asalkan ada dua-dua lah mixed
hairi dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay I have aira who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
hopefully soon belum seh she ask she ask me you know ibu when am I going to get my period five already primary six
dey kau sec one eh sec two ke sec one I know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes lah aku primary three
dia dia dia aku punya marker dia kalau dah start dah start kan chocolate lah ah that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya I think so dia aku punya marker every month
nanti kadang-kadang dia mood swing aku tak mood swing aku okay jer lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku are you going to get your period ah tapi after that I'll get it lah he's my marker first then after that I will get it nanti dia okay kelakar kan ya but but after that will be ah ye sejiwa lah sangat ya I think we sync already
ya so I have aira then I have hasif who is coming into primary school level and he talks so much and because he has the influences from dia punya brother and sister jadi dia punya perbualan tak macam budak primary school punya perbualan macam elly masih boleh berbual cute cute
cute lah masih cute lah juga hasif tak tau dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because I'm naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
abang why you never wait for me abang can you quickly do this kalau kalau aku ada macam abang you never clear the litter bukan aku yang suruh tau dia yang suruh
in a way lah tapi nanti abang dia complain nanti macam kadang-kadang laki aku cakap tanya aku whether I'm okay or not aku I have to tell him the truth ah I'm not okay
there's once I actually complain to him kalau aku punya kerja eh senang tau kau bangun pagi kau cium anak happy semua anak-anak tengah happy apa tanya okay okay I see you later ah then after that bila kau balik you attend your stuff already outside you go to the gym you come home it's dinner time the kids happy then it's already bedtime so you so so your time with them is like just it's only like one two hours ah it's bed time already finish then it's my time with you ah but in the middle
you you don't need to settle their breakfast you don't have to settle their lunch you don't have to settle their dinner ah then you don't see ya me instructing them eh pergi mandi lah sekarang dari pukul berapa kena solat kena ni kena gitu ni semua tolong ibu oh my god
alah camera tu camera tu for show jer bukannya pakai pun bila aku tinggalkan budak-budak sorang-sorang kat rumah
then aku penat tau aku cakap dengan dia kau balik kau nampak semua dah settle tau
except for sometimes berselerak which I will I will always like okay okay clean up clean up
pasal aku tak nak dia stressed ah kononnya macam dah dah tempat kerja is so difficult already then you come home and then you see more mess and you get fed up you know
anything ah so like because I have cats right jadi I have no choice in the morning first thing in the morning I have to do is vacuum then after that I mop
by the time tak payah tak payah tunggu satu tak sampai tunggu tiga jam lah satu dua jam jer kau nampak bulu semua bergerak
I have to do it jadi aku vacuum again
but I can't because I have a I have a err a crawling toddler you know abeh aku tak suka jadi aku kena if I shave them ah
tak lah cepat lah nanti grow balik ah ah
kena shave again aku shave sendiri lah mana ada kena bayar apa benda
shave sembarang
ah initially kita shave sembarang a'ah petak-petak lah gasak ah then after that macam initially macam kita nak eh let's let's try to to maintain dorang punya fur so we use the the the head whatever lah then in the end ah tak kuasa lah go down to zero shave aje semua terus nampak macam ah nampak macam biasa balik
aku punya ni banyak message ah macam banyak sangat itu ah messages coming to my phone
help apa
condition rumah aku
takde there's no way lah I the only way is for me to lazy parenting lah the robot I have I have it no it works the thing is aku
we were observing the robot tau kita cakap kesian robot ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena manoeuvre macam kalau aku jadi robot kan aku macam like alamak meja alamak ada child punya benda alamak mainan no and and that's how dia macam macam confused ah so the best the best thing ah when I was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy I do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
kita beli second hand aku punya benda takde lah first hand semua second hand
I called it lazy parenting lah I just order them about macam ayra sekarang dia dah pandai
belakang a'ah lah
kelabu asap ya granite
actually rumah aku dah dah takde is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all dah no ah the island I push there already because I don't I don't bake any more mah ya ya pasal aku dah tak bake jadi aku letak jer lah tolak ke tepi dulu so I have space to move around in the kitchen
then how yang tu kau tak pergi yang block two one eight tu why jauh daripada apa
I think so ya because sometimes err aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat kranji juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
rumah jannah
aku nampak rumah orang jer view apa
cause macam those rumah-rumah yang baru kan the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best that's why resale punya prices is still
pasal that time aku tanya ah naz rumah aku punya two years two years ya
ya means kalau dah naik market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
jauh ah aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus tau cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada dengan yes correct then yang kat hujung-hujung is ada tapi mahal
ya this location quite difficult that time ada yang block opposite opposite my house block two zero four dia jual dia punya
then dia jual murah because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it lah since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later gila nasib baik ya I was thinking of that ah
ya I was thinking you know like eh this is the best time you know yang let's just do it lah nanti kita boleh fikir cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my what
not not not tapping into his so okay apa
dia bayar dia punya part is lapan ratus aku punya part lima ratus
hmm but kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena increase but then again you'll be difficult lah cause if I prolong like this no job no contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser bila aku nak itu
chey sudah lah
kejap jer then lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak
tak aku aku nak need bigger space but then aku pun fikir bigger space means we probably buy more things
just be happy jer lah dengan apa dengan space yang aku ada because most of the time pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik
three is just enough in in in apa in the end pun kita plan at this moment ah because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
aira yang tu yang tak she volunteered she say nevermind hafis sleep with me
hmm because dia sorang jer apa yang she gets everything what her own her own like double girls lah ah but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far hmm that's why she don't mind that hafis sleep with her
they are all sleeping together still tilam tilam kau tu very useful bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal
so she sleep on her own tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam
ya in a way lah so gasak korang lor
tu dah start nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne
jap eh aku punya sini tak tak tak tak tak mute ke
kita berbual habis tu aku tak mute aku punya itu
ah takde pun
la ilaha illallah tak tahu lah
apa-apa ah
satu setengah ah mm mm
ya exactly cuma masalahnya is the noise from the background aje hopefully it doesn't affect so much lah exactly habis-tu pula telefon aku aku tak tahu
but that's the thing you see our aku tengah pasal bila first time aku nampak this thing kan aku macam like
tadi kita tadi kita dah macam cakap kan pasal ni aku cakap aku nak berbual dengan laki aku tapi laki aku cakap ya I don't speak malay which is true lah he no oh my god tak aku jer mixed mixed aku sorang jer yang boleh berbual dengan korang melayu fasih no problem takde masalah langsung kalau nak kasi aku apa kalau kau nak aku berbual apa tu chey berbual melayu yang yang no lah I mean like using proper malay words also I think I can try
a'ah tu lah aku pun rasa macam gitu eh cakap pasal banyak english banyak melayu kelmarin aku kena interview that was on wednesday no on tuesday
so mendaki nak interview aku so mendaki cakap dengan aku eh hasif ni kan in every of his class pasal hasif kan ambil yang mendaki nya classes which is free right ah in every of his class dia actually very outspoken pandai berbual ah you hantar dia untuk itu eh untuk preschool tak cakap ya dia pernah start daripada preschool lah start daripada play group dia cakap eh how about your other children aku cakap oh ya my eldest tu memang ah daripada nursery ah all the way sampai kindergarten oh kita tengah cari families lah yang hantar anak-anak gi ah preschool kita nak interview you boleh tak
okay jer aku aku sembarang gasak lah tak lah dia nak kasi aku voucher tak kesah lah aku tak kesah if it if it helps the community apa salahnya then dia cakap ya so kebetulan kau ingat tak yang there's one day yang aku hantar korang satu article a lot of malay families tak hantar so it's on conjunction with that kiranya dorang nak interview aku tu kan
to create awareness that how macam mana ah sekolah ah for preschool kan for preschoolers it's good to send kids err to preschool to
you know permulaan from all the different cases lah
ya ramai a lot so bila aku berbual dengan so yang datang tu is a mendaki person and then there's this person I do not know I think she is err from
yang err
maybe from the preschool punya aku tak tahu lah okay lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang interview aku tu it's from berita harian so aku tanya actually kenapa you nak interview I pasal the preschoolers ah cause is it because of this article that I read err budak-budak ah apa bangsa melayu tak itu
aku cakap ah ah tak dorang tak hantar then I say kenapa err what's the reason you tahu tak apa dia punya reason dia cakap dorang cakap is not necessary
jadi dorang hantar K one K two jer huh
aku cakap lah eh itu zaman mak bapa kita seh zaman mak bapa kita ye lah kita hantar K one K two jer ah tapi sekarang I think
the system dah berubah
if you send to the government punya the punya dorang memang tak ada childcare service apa it's only a few hours everyday lain lah kalau dorang ambil ambil yang macam ah macam aku punya is private so they have a childcare service from seven to seven
so pada aku macam like apa seh pada aku like why would you say it is not necessary pada that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan you bila you ah decided to hantar lah anak you pergi preschool
that's where then then I ask lah this interview going to be in malay or english eh abeh dia cakap in malay lah aku cakap my malay is also tak strong sangat mm kita mixed mixed boleh cakap ah boleh ah so kita berbual
the dia punya question was very legit ah like macam okay first kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi preschool secondly ah bagaimana ah bagaimana ah
mm ah apabila menghantar mereka tu kan ah did it help
did it help in what dorang punya perkembangan ah dalam pelajaran
ah development self development tu aku cakap lah pasal dorang punya motor skills dorang punya cognitive behaviour dorang punya social skill and then benda-benda yang yang preschool boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar like saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang math ke
more sight words ke phonics ke it's very difficult for me to read I don't have the takde macam dia punya layout on how to teach them
tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah kan semua dah ada
err a program for them ah senang sikit
so dorang tanya like um
then dia cakap like macam how do you feel lah bila hantar like is there any improvement aku cakap ya ada banyak lah improvement terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang very err friendly
you know he's very active dia pandai pandai berbual public speaking pun dia tak takut
which is true tak takut seh ah dia macam like ah gasak ah sembarang ah you know
so but aku macam like feel very abeh dia tanya aku lah like err is it do you think that it's because of finances
then aku cakap terus terang ni memang berat because saya ni sekarang tak bekerja jadi ah finances okay lah berat juga untuk anak-anak tapi this is for anak-anak education there has to be a way mesti ada jalan lain kalau nak cakap pasal private tak boleh
we go to a government based ah government aided sekolah and then kalau kita low income mesti the sekolah has a system for the lower income family jadi dapat further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about kalau tak nak berbual pasal finances there could another reason the other reason kenapa ah mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi preschool kerana tak ada tempat ah tak ada tempat mm in the neighbourhood tak cukup preschool ya so so I cakap okay terus terang ah untuk hafif I masuk kan nak masuk kan dia infant care
I registered him for infant care bila I masih dalam perut this is where orang semua cakap eh kiasu nya dulu pun I pun macam gitu aku cakap gitu dulu pun aku macam gitu apasal eh orang apa pregnant masih dalam perut dah dah registered now after that I dah kena I tahu kenapa kerana tak ada tempat so people have to be like
think ahead cause a lot of families right now I told her lah a lot of families right now dorang prefer hantar anak from what I know I notice prefer hantar anak pergi preschool pergi childcare daripada ada maid kat rumah because kalau kat childcare budak-budak belajar can develop you know at home ah
susah kan
take care only tapi ah
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
don't try so hard lah cukup lah
terus aku macam like lepas tu aku fikir-fikir balik aku macam like eh kesiannya kalau kita punya malay community really do not want to

ayah wah sudah tak buat ini ah gathering
then from dia kirakan like mix lah english english singlish melayu
next week kau start ni kan apa ah volunteer eh
kat mana ni kau pergi where is it
orientation online macam mana what like what a lot of you meet macam gitu
ya lah this kind of volunteering betul betul betul betul betul I'm sure you can find something that you can do best you know macam that will fit you punya
chinese new year I think uh end jan apa
selalunya selalunya kan end jan
entah copywriting ya exactly maybe they should they will definitely make you guys to macam go on the ground isn't it macam distribute stuff no ah kau tak penat ke but they might ask you to do that no like be on the ground
penat ke apa engkau ke you know like you got to
how the hell would I know abeh macam you have to go on the ground like what if they ask you to like okay you go to the homes and distribute stuff
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the uh volunteers right so aku my my my volunteering with them is really fostering ah so I'm a rather than you know uh
it's a shelter the dogs are in kan kan is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what tengah ya tengah ya we are very close it's it's just next to choa chu kang ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter uh that involves dog walking
err cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then uh there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like macam they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this uh uh at this uh area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to macam
uh macam orang lalu-lalang kan then you macam talk about the awareness gitu lah which I wouldn't mind doing actually uh tapi sekarang uh we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that lah for being like you said lah because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker boleh lah cuma only you and the dogs tapi macam public all this awareness sort of stuff uh no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get uh emails pasal unit unit ambassadors and all that tapi now no more
ambassadors macam you you you macam you at the booth and you wear punya t-shirt uh you're next to the merchandise punya table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations punya uh apa ni uh tin tu kan and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do uh this is what we do as an and these are the cases macam gitu awareness of uh what does and how they can help oh they also have social uh pre-corporate social responsibility punya programs companies punya tu
so then you can do that uh they can say oh we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer ada volunteer macam photography
macam to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the gambar-gambar for the calendars so regular they need uh you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot lah I'm one of them
which I'm fostering for kucing I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
fosterer for puppies macam gitu so when they have cases then they contact you say okay wati we have this then
exactly kesian kan
you know lah kan international kan kan nama international punya brand kan so orang pun ada lah you know macam kasih donation gitu ada lah I think I guess they do have you know uh
uh but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad uh kita punya G O V takde kasih apa-apa
dia orang eh ini binatang-binatang kita orang tau daripada negeri ini mesti lah jaga sikit
ah that is the masalahnya tu
oh I think must there has to be some uh apa ni uh macam caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not lah macam of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas bukit batok lah banyak banyak macam jungle jungle apa they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know bukit batok has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the uh estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain uh authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out  you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
tengah mm mm mm
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out punggol pasir ris choa chu kang but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but takde collaboration kau faham tak takde supportive effort at all macam okay kau okay kita sekarang kita punya and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean kita nak buat macam gitu macam okay kita dia orang because dia orang uh yang boleh ambil I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and duit takde duit kan so siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu kan government kan so at least macam okay kita tolong collaborate lah you know uh okay uh kita buat ni then you all can uh kita boleh kasih kau orang support sikit-sikit untuk blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so apa yang buat sekarang is bila binatang ni keluar yang gahmen gahmen ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya itu yang kita boring
ya lah tapi not to this extent not to this extent look at tengah now tengah baru tengah is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because tengah is still around correct lim chu kang sekarang semua nak development punggol mana ada punggol dulu dulu mana ada waterway punggol sekarang dah ada punggol apa all the dogs from punggol are coming out you can you can literally walk on punggol street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs dulu mana ada because punggol was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because wah dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
the wild boar pun sama
betul exactly aku nak salahkan wild boar tu macam mana kesian pula so this is exactly what we are ini macam frustration lah kan
no gatal kau tengok aku punya ni rashes tapi aku memang sensitive skin
kau kulit kulit buaya
kau takde macam ni cover ni kan ni kan
abeh ada tulis arab ah
kena saman there's no such thing
I don't know about the saman part I know you that you kena saman if you litter
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue apa
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed makan makan makan ah dah habis okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they balik then patah balik dia orang patah balik then clear lah
kalau tidak it is considered littering
entah littering lah whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
town councils town councils um cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign lah dekat kat lift landing you know uh please keep clear within two hours macam gitu macam posters
bagus lah
block mana this block this block
kesian kan
macam back to macam back to nature eh
scout does I thought dia bawa kawan dia
ni depan ni eh
kesian eh
away from all the orang-orang
ya eh masa
macam what bila aku dekat uh botanic gardens aku kerja kat situ oh my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
oh they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them dia orang macam ada very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
uh I guess because botanic gardens kan ada lakes kan ada lakes ada eco lake swan lake and all the macam the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so uh when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so uh the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe macam ada bodyguard
ya dah macam they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though oh my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families dia macam different clans
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families macam different hello macam macam tigers kan lions kan ada different pride
sini ada so they have the kallang clan the kallang one which is like the the family that lives ya alah kau baca lah dalam surat khabar you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
ya they are macam a'ah they macam the hobbies gitu
ah yes they are watching the birds the ah okay yes macam gitu
mana ya alah of course lah they look the same mana lah aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the kallang clan
uh so the kallang clan otters are the ones that hang out in the kallang area dia macam territorial lah
maybe they are another clan but then again you know yang dekat yang dekat kallang tu wah I tell you
uh or the ones yang pergi kau tak baca dia masuk kat
ah gitu dengan tu that one is one clan know
ya eh dekat bishan park bishan park pun ada tau
you know macam they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
uh this is their territory kau masuk dalam territory dia orang boleh bergaduh
dia orang bukan macam um some canines some felines yang after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
I think uh tempat fishing punya people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think kallang I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook mati tau so sad
they macam they go to their mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana but they have their own spare trait lah kalau kau macam pergi dekat kallang river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
to be honest aku tak ingat sejak bila when is the first time they came out but otters ni tapi uh
uh both apa ni uh I don't know I don't know I don't remember when aku nak kencing I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly apa apasal aku toilet what do you mean I come back lah
ya cakap jer but I don't remember exactly when the otters um
uh I don't remember exactly when the otters you know keluar but definitely at least uh you know five years I think
bila bila aku start perasan ni lah when I first started you know noticed the news ah not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
masa kampung babe masa kampung-kampung dulu kan ada sungai-sungai otters nak pergi nak buat apa sekarang they're all where are they going to go
sama lah sama lah
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove apa dekat sungei buloh tu kan so I guess they decided to jalan keluar jauh sikit lor
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do uh they will do um macam awareness macam don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't apa apa you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context lah these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know oh they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group uh this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies meh ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is kau tahu macam
macam macam the ornithologist yang tengok-tengok observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know the otters in the city wow can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like wow what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like macam unlikely sight
ya mana ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently uh couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at entah bukit merah or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
ya all these com cats kat bawah it's the natural predator apa natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already mati because of these the snake pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang snake tu yang snake tu tengah com cat dekat depan dekat mak news ah snake com cat ah
betul tu I fully agree I fully agree ya I pun tengok the changi airport ada banyak benda nak buat eh I heard ah dekat changi airport ada this changi village kan ada what this ah steamboat or barbecue thingy what's the name of the restaurant I can't really ingat ah
oh ya that that's amazing that's amazing okay ah I don't mind go tonight I ask adam ah whether he wants to go or not so I mean I I think adam tengah dia mengidam want to eat beef there got beef ke tak ah
ah andes andes andes kat sebelah jer kan
oh okay lah I tak tahu I I think sedap mania would be good ah some more it's like you know the barbecue smell the charcoal kind of smell you know then balik semua bau baju bau gitu someone so
so oh ah ya lah ya lah but lepas tu ya maybe after kita dah makan duduk sana and then we can go over to changi airport can cycle look at what touristic mile thingy will be quite cool quite cool ya
then apa tu siapa lagi ah might follow ah
no he had nothing I pun tak tahu lah why he so tired
ah ya lah I mean kalau kita tak jadi pergi malam ni then maybe we can think about like going maybe like the seletar cafe or something
oh ya actually kan kalau kita car lite to there will it be expensive or cheap ah
oh ya true true sinopec ya very cheap but one thing ah I pump minyak by sinopec minyak ni macam
cepat habis ah minyaknya like tak concentrated you know so I'm like what's happening here ah
a'ah lah agaknya ah letak air
ah yang your your buku you borrow you start reading already or not
I think ada punya cari eatigo eh let me tengok eatigo pun okay juga eh kita boleh rasa makanan dia like like
harga dia pun err ah berpatutan betul betul
um okay by the way I baru check eatigo ah hari ini memang ada lima puluh percent so err selain dining in the garden ada apa lagi eh
tak I will I will think changi village will be a good idea lah tapi adam tak nak pergi ah adam ya
nanti I kena pujuk lah I punya adik untuk nak pergi kedai changi village cause I pun macam nak rasa makan barbecue barbecue but somehow I pergi sana akan makan cheese tofu sahaja so
eh lapar ah
ya kejap I tanya adam adam you nak pergi ke tak
adam dia cakap dia tak nak
I pun tak tahu ah adam cakap dia nak jinjja
dekat mana eh dekat
ah jewel boleh juga kat jewel
dia boleh tengok tengok aeroplane juga dekat jewel
I rasa tak
a'ah eh dekat hub ada kan
oh betul tu
it's like how to say ah it's like macam jinjja chicken oh oh no no it's like uh wing stop wing zone that one
okay lah ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy macam chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap sia
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like macam you go to jinjja chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or ah it's that one lah macam gitu but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like macam got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone lah got a lot of different flavour ah like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather sedap mania ah sedap mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right kalau colour hijau then this price kalau
kuning the other price right colour hijau do you remember because colour hijau is the cheapest mah right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
oh sounds yummy ya okay apa
ah it will be nice right I went to the website just now then I saw they got a satay soup base laksa soup base I'm like wah confirm sedap ah macam gitu
baik satay sauce soup base ya ya I think it's a new flavour maybe
tapi I tengah diet
tapi takpe lah hari ini dimaafkan lah
cheat day yes betul tu cheat day
macam mana I tak tahu kejap I tanya adik I adam
adik I mata tutup ah tiba-tiba
apa B B nine
err bukan bukan bukan
ya bukan
so okay kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni eh mari kita
ah nak cakap pasal orang tak
tak senonoh gitu eh
orang kasih assignment kita mengumpat
okay okay ya alright kita jadi serious um apa kita nak berbual eh um
uh kita punya keluarga or okay no lah no lah ah shares lah stock market lah eh
so um you ada any investment you you dah buat ke or anything you nak recommend
but I tak tahu because sekarang nak beli tesla mahal tak mampu though
I think kalau I I will beli the stock uh for what I have now lah my capital yang ada I would probably invest in cheaper stocks lah singapore based stocks like
uh old chang kee for example err murah jer you tahu tak old chang kee dia punya share price is err enam puluh satu sen saje tau ah serious a'ah betul tu then kalau you ada macam seratus ke dua ratus dollar then you akan
berbaloi lah then I I I mean ah I was looking at their annual report then old chang kee kan
dia orang akan open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like macam the demand for asian foods are rising tapi supply tak banyak
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region kan then agaknya I would think lah it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like um they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend lah so I mean that's my thing lah cause sekarang I don't think I I boleh mampu lah tesla mahal saje
ya tapi itu my thing lah on stocks
tapi masalahnya some some stocks dia orang tak how to say dia orang tak syariah on client tau so nanti dia orang tak
tak boleh lah kita tak boleh ambil dia punya um benefits lah from that stocks so ya I don't know lah I tak tahu lah ni semua islamic financial ah you tahu tak anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it lah that time I went for this uh website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get syariah pampasan or not
so it's very interesting because macam they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's uh allowed or not haram or halal lah in that sense tapi the problem with that website ah they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you kena bayar
then I'm like alamak then you muslim pun nak buat duit
nak tengok stocks halal ke tak
but I would say it's good lah like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very macam you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay lah that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
ya I think bagus lah kita sekarang err I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive lah
so ya bagus bagus bagus
you rasa
you rasa
good tak stocks
ya anyway err betul tu ya but I heard kan itu kalau you nak pakai wahed invest then
ada some fees involved right like apa tu
um okay apa eh nak bilang you oh ya anyway I I found out there is days
technically grow your money but with very low return lah so macam kalau you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you tak nak letak it in the bank lah
because firstly kalau you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the hibah tak banyak
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new saham returns tapi tak banyak the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like uh macam it's like a savings account with a little bit more uh
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
wasted lah I think like a lot of people macam lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are tak halal
ya lah wasted kalau dia orang tak invest in bonds then kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam seh if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
can lah nanti I call dia orang
ya lah I call lah I call lah I bilang lah kenapa ni right
for the idea of islamic finance because technically um you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also macam in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore macam not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
interest yielding accounts and maybe dia orang tak tahu lah it's haram because you would need to kind of know mah yang kita tak boleh yang interest and all bonds are tak halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya kita terus deep eh berbual
ya ya ya betul betul betul I was looking at um the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting lah because uh one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are err they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
SOCOE will be a good tapi I pun macam tak faham sangat lah how how the SOCOE um investment works but halal kan dia kan so boleh lah eh
oh kita punya trip eh ah I tak tahu lah I I punya adik kejap eh I call my adik hello
adik I baru kentut adik I kentut adik I lepas ni nak kena
I tak tahu dia punya ada like a mix of a and I don't know dia makan apa tapi bau dia like one kind you know toxic toxic
kentut ah I think maybe yes lah dia nak eating lah agaknya rasa gitu ah
ya ya itu I I I tu tak okay ha ha so anyway um
nak pergi makan I pun lapar sekarang belum makan so I pun nak pergi makan actually kan is hafizah going or not to sedap mania like what what do you think the chances are
mm mm ya lor actually semua pun dah agree apa sunday semua okay
aiyo unless kita just go somewhere to like makan lor
then after that we just lepak then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like lepak and makan lor
I would think maybe seletar cafe will be good tapi sana makanan dia tak halal so mana kita boleh makan oh maybe we can eat at seletar airport the mister teh tarik express dia tu mahal ke
I tak tahu what are good things for us to makan eh err
okay lah nanti I berbual dengan I punya adik lah mana kita nak pergi
but ya lah kita try lah I I pun lapar eh I I want to eat sedap mania
ah tengok ubin also
eh I didn't know tau ubin ada macam malay punya makcik jual I just recently found out I'm like what
ya lah okay tak nanti I kena banyak pujuk adik I lah
betul betul tu eh oh ya by the way just now I was looking at sedap mania punya website then uh
they have a lunch promo I think it's seven dollars or eight dollars and eighty or like macam let's say chicken set then you get your own in individual soup base then you get your own
sayur-sayuran condiments lah then you boleh like you know it's your own personalised then it's like eight dollar eighty cents tapi dia punya timing it's only from eleven thirty to two thirty so it's like actually during the lunch hours
ya ya kita dah missed confirm lah
ya besok lah I I okay juga kalau esok besok I think besok confirm tak ramai orang eh kalau pergi lunch lagi confirm kosong habis
it actually it sounds like a plan you know let me see ah besok monday I think I got nothing on
kita terus pergi ubin I boleh tapi perempuan I don't think dia orang pergi sebab besok christina I think dia kena exam so I think she cannot then hafizah dia nak ke
boleh juga kita cycle ke ubin
oh what's new ah like or rather what because december semua holidays we should like explore more places
marsiling tanya lah
car lite I think is err I think kalau the most expensive one right is err four dollars per four or six dollars per fifteen minutes
tak jadi lah gini
actually one hour eight dollar blue oh tak lah blue blue lagi mahal lah
I haus so ini air mineral water eh
eh a'ah lah kita minum air sama
oh tak lah ini kecil punya meadows
ya ya ya ya correct imagine dia orang tak
tak catch the fizz thingy then they just let people drink then they just let people drink wah
like err what's that word aniaya
eh takde lah sampai gitu
apa lagi kita boleh berbual pasal pasal entah lah
ah macam nak baca buku berbual buku tapi
tak boleh kan
biscoff itu tak boleh dah
ah ya sekarang I see biscoff dekat out of stock kat lazada out of stock
semalam I pergi cold storage ada stock so baru beli lah ya
makan lah sedap tu I buat cake pakai biscoff
coconut oil I I tak jual I beli pasal itu for rambut bagus sama rambut I sekarang macam berang kan so bagus ah bagus moisturising
alamak apa jadi
gini lah I sekarang
nak find ideas lah want to like the social mission
tapi I pun tak tahu so in singapore apa social mission you can solve
mana boon keng is it
at this block block block sebelas eh
ada yang sebelah main road tu yang you pass by satu block macam horizontal
ah block block tu I dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak eh block tu ada dadah semua I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
oh distant eh jauh lah tu
nama dia Q
ya so macam mana you tahu ni Q tinggal kat boon keng
I see I see ya I mean is is it because dia tinggal kat boon keng takde bapa ke tinggal boon keng pasal takde bapa
I I curious lah macam you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
oh dengan datuk dia
contohnya apa khabar eh are you close with the datuk
mak dia doctor apa though
like wah so I mean not bad eh walaupun dia tinggal at risk block mak dia doctor
kencang seh then kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak take her out you know
ah psychology you pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
bagus bagus bagus very good
I actually now you speaking of which ah I think I met someone like this you know tak tahu orang sama ke this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the boon keng area then there was this doctor dan dia punya kucing
so I was like tapi dia tengah pakai white coat lah eh doctor dengan kucing
ah a'ah lah agaknya vet I mean we don't know lah pasal career banyak
but I mean okay lah so maknya consider good lah doctor
good lah tapi anaknya
um I tak tahu I heard anak dia
ah I don't know how I heard lah where I heard lah agaknya kat mothership anak dia macam
apa seorang ah sampai or rather act a bit pelik you know
maybe dia punya anak needs treatment lah like like do you think so
a'ah lah agaknya lah however tak tahu
ya ya ya betul tu maybe what we can do is we can actually find this um Q your distant relative we can ajak her lah go makan oh maybe sedap mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
duit so
lagi more reason lah takde lah takde lah
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true lah if someone is put in that environment they kind of macam angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you takde you know outlet boleh keluarkan the perasaan
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally lah eh macam mana her eh I tau eat him or her up like internally
mm ah kenapa ni
um sentosa I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump itu I tak berani
tramp punya trail then we just macam
you cannot claim compensation lah because it's at your own risk mah you masuk tempat gitu so
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good lah cause kalau kalau tak then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
can also then luge macam laju lah a bit too fast don't you think so
morning will be best tapi
we can go malam lah or we can go like in the evening macam cold kan begitu so macam sunset
dia tak panas sangat and ya
not pergi maghrib I mean
mm okay okay then then good lah I would think of saturday banyak orang but it should be fine lah should be fine lah
I I sekarang tengah tengok harga per the hit rock mahal juga
ya ya that that's the lowest yang ada but other one is seven rides seventy five dollars and one ride is only five minutes yo
a'ah lah laju sangat ah
wait ah let me see ah apa lagi kita boleh buat dekat sana because it's only participating attractions so uh
eh I heard dia banyak burung uh okay anyway I tengok hit rock actually ada boleh lah err
blue zone one ride is fifteen token so boleh lah mampu kalau you nak two rides from green orange or blue zone
oh okay oh okay sea aquarium pun the token so boleh mampu
boleh juga then a bit boring actually boleh lah because ten token saje apa bukan ke tiga puluh apa
tapi I tak tahu boleh combine ke tak because it's their giant swing
bukan I think is bungee jump I don't know it's just says giant swing plus skyride plus ice cream fifty five token
tapi I takut lah I don't think I I can lah
eh ni macam interesting juga eh
ya naik segway
let me see eh kayak eh takde lah
takde kayak
actually we can take cable car I I pun tak pernah naik so if you want we can take the sentosa one just three dollars mah
ya ya ya so we can do that lah so it sounds like a plan ya I think it it or if you want sentosa island bus tour ten token I mean macam lame lah
mega bounce ten ten token two mega two mega zip sixty five token kira mahal lah mega jump fifteen token
actually kalau nak boleh juga kita boleh ten token lah untuk segway
then lagi the other ten token kita naik this
eh boleh lah you jangan kita kita tak buat banyak banyak benda lah
okay lah adam adam pun nak kan pergi so I ajak my adik also everyone lah this saturday go ramai-ramai
then actually kalau nak kita boleh beli the twelve piece chicken just now I was telling you about the shake shack duck that one
ya so we can buy that one so at the same time we can bring over loaf of bread untuk makan sandwich ke apa
err let me think maybe dekat maple city ah dekat and it's halal so shake shack in a duck
ya betul tu err they have one in great world city
I am sure a bit out of the way ah um unless we can nak kalau nak kita boleh beli dekat ang mo kio hub eh
lapan ada eh eh lapan ada lah ada jer tau kalau kat north kan
a'ah geram I wah not bad eh eh but I don't know whether the promo masih ada tak kalau
twelve dollars I'm not too sure tapi worth it seh twelve dollars
uh I'm not sure about the harga biasa but I think it will be much more than that lah definitely much more than that but actual price I am not too sure actually I pun tak pernah makan I just saw this on the telegram group
so we got two more weeks actually so okay lah that's ons saturday tak boleh lah
ya lah but really looks good lah this section letak yucks okay
ada ada ada buy as you but we can buy or we can take the tram there also lah if you want
so I can just ah so can ya ya so segway I think interesting lah cause one hour dia bawa orang kita jauh-jauh semua
err they say okay so segway one hour eh I salah kot kejap eh
oh dia bukan segway dia bipedal bicycle for one hour
kalau you nak segway fun ride for five hundred meters it's fifteen token
tersalah so lah so the ten token right is for a bipedal bicycle
I I I tak tahu I I would think so
ya depan belakang kan
ya lah kalau begitu kena if you want to take the segway kan the segway eh mana ada
segway is fifteen token tapi five hundred meter saja lah half a
kalau you nak kita boleh pergi ifly
tapi dia punya token hundred and ten
eh okay token dia sixty token kalau you want one skydive
okay lah I mean okay so I think kita kalau nak we can go mega adventure park we can do one mega bound
macam tu lah would be best if we can like have a lot of like different different kind lah activities
ten token for one ride so kalau you nak we can do err one which is like five minutes confirm tak cukup tapi okay lah one one of ride and the other one is err the mega bounce mega zip so ten plus ten
you know that's one way lah we can if you want kita pun boleh pergi sea aquarium also ten token and it's it's a tour open ocean discovery tour sea aquarium
tak eh sedap seh I've been to aspirasi
ya or maybe we can go there makan first at seah im the aspirasi then after that we head into sentosa lah because kan nak naik the monorail also it's free what
tapi nak pergi pukul berapa tu kalau saturday malam sangat nanti kena macam rush
I okay tapi it won't happen one pagi
susah um okay lah we put it about three o'clock kita jumpa
ya three two two or three eh what do you mean force rabung maghrib pe
I think adam pernah pergi force rabung and he he say that is okay leh but he went in the day
ya that's why maybe tonight kalau jumpa then he can tell you more about it lah
kalau jumpa lah ya
so ya lagi tiga minit
eh okay lah so next saturday nineteen kita pergi lah what whatever time lah because I think kalau nak morning is gonna be difficult like habis not possible
two o'clock would be a very macam practical time two to three o'clock
um let me see sea aquarium tutup pukul five
pukul lima on saturday also five but we have a tour so I think if I don't know must follow the tour or own time own target so
ah ada ada red colour yes okay
okay kita kena berbual english and malay
okay cuba cakap
because dia course by united
tapi class ni kenapa dia ah eight hours
mm tapi work from home ah
are you being paid untuk course ni
dah um semalam ada meeting err dekat conference room
ah aku gather all the ten of them lepas tu dalam ya ten of them split into two accounts
so dalam two account tu ada dalam
aku nya old team ada empat orang
err the other team ada enam orang
six six orang dalam team lepas tu kan ada social distancing kan so aku approach err safety manager ah minta pasal aku nak get the message relate to them across um but um I don't want to split the err dua dua team aku nak err two teams to dengar apa aku cakap as one so dorang tak confused
I want them to know the anyway boss aku memang the the day before
dia dah dah cakap dengan aku lah what to say dia cakap firstly about the unpaid cuti tu jangan
jangan bilang customer
don't tell the customer just say that we are clearing our leave tak tahu apasal boss suruh macam be confidential about it padahal it's quite known in singapore banyak orang sebab tu in the end um but I have to say what she say lah she's on leave dia tengah cuti so um during the meeting everybody um listen semua dengar semua ye so the two err explain that the two unpaid leave tu nak kena ambil december
february dengan march
then kalau macam the situation doesn't improve
err start for this err unpaid leave cuti kena ambil
compulsory you cannot macam bawa to the next err month you have to err settle lah within that month but rotate err every member kena ada backup dalam office
so that at least ada one person to answer customers' calls
kena ah so macam today is one of the unpaid ah
unpaid cuti err for december hari ni aku ambil dengan another day next week
so dalam bulan december aku kerja seven days only
best kalau boleh pergi holiday
and tak tolak gaji
ah free kan dapat
ya I think civil servants ada restriction kan
but two years eh kawan aku kata they don't know indefinitely
then macam mana um then how they clear the leave
I think they can break I think they will pay that time got ada keluar news apa
aku tak ingat apa ah tapi ada ada incentive the government say because they know that the civil servants cannot clear leaves
so cuti they will back they will back pay will cash or something
ada kan
for civil servants confirm ada that day baru ada pe they will they will pay the err they will bayar
tapi tak ada yang you know the apa usually apa bonus tu yang
extra berapa bulan for government civil servants ah that one tak should be tak ada adik aku pun tengah
she also mengeluh because
biasa ah kita dah beli beli beli barang we always macam nak kena
they hope they hope dia macam she hope for the bonus to
dia boleh bayar balik ah bill bill
kau tak perasan ke yang bila kau dah stop kerja then work from home ni that your your that your apa tu expenditure is lesser
tak lesser ke
motor masih keep ah
kereta memang necessary for korang pasal korang a family of enam
family of enam enam six cats seven cats
tapi alhamdulillah lah aku rasa ada berkat lah macam I'm sure somehow eh dia dia cukup tau cuma kita macam rasa macam we maybe because we don't see the the income coming in every month as a lump sum eh so we think macam
we are restricted tapi actually barang-barang semua masih still go on
dia penatnya apa bila kau kat rumah then dengan kerja while working nak kena tengok budak tengok rumah kemas lagi sebab tu macam overwhelming
time masa off
mm betul
jemput makan eh jemput minum sila kan
dah dah settle
bila dapat tu results
then dia nya first choice ah
yang yang okay what secondary school will that be
masa masa zaman-zaman kita tu the reputation not very good ah
oh but eh now maybe dah changed ke
oh the neighbourhood situ eh
tahniah for your result
ah jual besi
every month every month macam one point three for one account tau
so yang bulan lepas err our sales
cuma two hundred fifty eight K
tak drop banyak tu from one million err dia dia start turun bila tau bulan june july august
dah start to decline then the number of orders we used to get like hundred over orders dalam satu hari
sekarang satu hari dua tiga ke empat order macam system and it's like cutting metals for like a few inches orh really really very bad the demand drop
err dorang buat dorang assemble untuk ah the machine assemble untuk ah oil rig masuk kan dalam oil rig
so you know yang macam equinox err shell axon order kat all the oil rigs tu when they put things inside the down hole stuff too ah that metal they they buy from us kita kirakan macam distributor ah sell the metal kerja memang sebenarnya kerja aku ni jual besi
ada macam-macam size the round bars the tube all the tubings nanti they will order macam certain sizes then we need to look at the drawing sometimes they say ah we want to make something from this so what do you have dalam stock
to offer um benda-benda gini ah nanti dalam inventory tengok ah size yang kena ada abeh aku kena plan inventory for them the stock level must be always available so that bila dorang beli bendanya ada tak payah tunggu
cuma different product ah barang lain so
somehow yang bila yang last year tu bila aku dapat promoted tu from one account they ask me to also take over another account
so kirakan macam two accounts combined ni is the two biggest account dalam company mm
which is unexpected lah yang pasal aku kan baru habis cerai that time kan
then ah after the divorce tu
somehow ah aku tak tahu ah then the boss yang cina tu kata um we need to look into your portfolio you need to grow yourself so
then err dia tanya aku nak ke tidak macam if bukan aku dia akan offer to another person then the other person if not ambitious ah this girl dalam company aku ni there's another account manager yang very ambitious
then dia pursue dia punya degree at the same time I with her own money pasal dia nak aku rasa dia nak position boss aku boss aku asia and ah
asia-pac marketing and apa eh marketing and apa director
so dia kata if you don't take tak take up this position I'll have to offer to another person the your colleague
then the other person ni dia okay dia ambitious aku tahu it suits it suits her lah tu macam dia bukan ada
not someone yang there yet lah but pada aku macam not the
ah tak
bukan experience dia macam dia micro manage ah
abeh dia imposed macam kerja-kerja macam dia punya
dia bahasa kalau dia buat format eh
kalau aku buat format nak kena macam gini nak kena ikut tau team members semua kena ikut cara dia gitu ah dia akan check one by one kau buat kerja betul ke tidak like if you don't do it um betul-betul dia macam
dia send one email nanti dia kasi
dia buat ah step one step two step three really really micro manage punya kind of person jadi macam
aku pula bahasa agaknya aku tak teratur tak organise langsung
aku akan usually dengan budak dengan team members aku bilang dorang you do like this tapi pandai-pandai kau lah buat cara sendiri lah takde format punya benda tau dia lain dia bahasa kena ada format dia nak kena after this dot must have exclamation mark atau question mark that kind tau
very teratur very neat and tertib tulisan dia pun very tu kadang-kadang aku pun hairan macam mana dia boleh
aku totally opposite tapi boss aku cakap macam dia cakap err she will also be promoted but she will take care of the well head activities then aku take over the down hole activities so that time aku fikir err try jer lah ambil jer dulu lah that's how sekali dah take over dengan tahun ni dengan COVID ah kau sales baik dua account twenty one million ah tahun ni tak aku rasa
work wise ah work wise macam aku boleh manage ah cuma every night sekarang almost every night nak kena kerja
kena buat report
kat during the day tak there's simply not enough time mana answer customer nya email then err nanti ada quality issues lah supply chain issues logistic tak datang lah then at the same time kau kena check into inventory then check into macam housekeeping at the same time kita kena think of ways to reduce the inventory
macam-macam lah dalam satu hari one day you can like
tak boleh habis so nanti benda-benda report yang bahasa nak kena churn out data
aku buat malam kat rumah atau that time during work from home tu kan tu lagi productivity terus turun pasal siang anuh budak-budak take care of the kids punya tu
nanti aku macam takde aku tak boleh focus tau ah macam aku punya walaupun tak banyak kerja rumah aku boleh just let go tak buat apa-apa
tapi you can't macam tak boleh tau the data that you're you're doing at that point I rasa macam
takpe ah nanti I need macam quietness at the night baru aku buat ah tapi pada time malam aku dah tidurkan elly nanti aku dah energy aku dah gone that's why sometimes aku cakap telefon apa jamu nak ambil
yang deep station yang tu aku beli kan
itu aku rasa help with tangan aku that time
pasal bila lepas two months aku rasa macam takde effect aku stop tapi right after aku stop tu
about one month tu tangan aku clear tau dah tak gatal-gatal lagi tau there's a period aku remember aku jumpa liyana um she also noticed eh tangan dah baik your hand is better now
sekali one month aku tidur rumah aku start balik
so aku rasa sebab aku stop the deep station thing ke every night every morning aku consume waktu bulan puasa dengan hari raya

hancur melayu participate macam tu eh participate uh terima kasih kerana berbual dengan saya atas voice recording err thanks thanks very much for helping me with this project and
kalau boleh mungkin next time again lah but
because sometimes when you speak melayu and english it's not it's not difficult to switch but I mean
I think when you cannot find the right word in english then you will like or the brain will just tukar-tukar
check bank siapa nak check siapa nak bank
because I started a business selling tahu begedil selling tahu begedil yes
basically because I like to eat tahu begedil
um quite recently eh ah like last month ah late last month when tahu begedil was was like a trend
um tahu begedil and they both
apa tu macam ada lah dia punya kesedapan tu kan ya
for a while because ibu force me to
but um making this tahu begedil of course I only started recently
um eh I mean there were no macam kedai taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
so I think ah this tahu begedil I will only sell bila ada time lah macam holidays
so maybe like maybe the next week is not tahu begedil it's like
oh I didn't call I didn't name it but ibu and abang named it as
bawal yes tudung bawal you know there's square scarf
um one is the our cotton bawal and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk bawal and our cotton bawal it sells
kita suka try benda like try to do things new things and we try to ya lah
we hustle a lot macam tak kesah ah kalau hari-hari kerja
asalkan like kita boleh rasa duit tu ah
ah inshallah wah untuk ah benda yang halal
oh like mati macam melayu
apa tu open casting for new models
like tak suka ambil gambar and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a hijabi model
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't simpan because the quality is like shit
and then I come back with just a piece of tudung for me it's like merepek so
ibu um
apa ni um shops coming to you uh for shooting she said then okay lah I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
people also come to me um to do to create apa to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
I don't know whatever barang that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried uh an influencer before to boost start my um Kamash um the tudung brand
apa tu our
to the company first let them approve apa-apa macam if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people ah macam tambah-tambah lah ah themselves and then they
then they send back to us then baru kita copy paste and then put
selling clothes selling muslimah clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
macam ah you need to do your research err do survey do prototype everything
um sellers terdahulu biasa about apa yang dorang suka instead of what
you get what I mean macam they
assume that orh aku suka ni so confirm orang lain akan suka
pasal um a lot of people say eh ni lawa confirm ada orang suka confirm ada orang suka but we cannot hear what our family members really um say we need to reach out to people
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum ah she said like orh ni colour cantik everything whatever shit
but then actually salah ah it's not selling our first
simple macam not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful tapi a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like eh eh ni mana ada orang pakai cotton lagi kan panas kan panas but it sell out like a lot um we bought I'm ten colours
bila dah membesar right sambil membesar
ya sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar tau apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then ibu tak suka so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
um she said oh you know um macam she tell told me all the negative things lah all the
it's like jaga mayat jaga mayat and then like
but of course ibu also tak kasi because she say I will mati cepat the I'm like kalau ajal tu ada mati lah I mean like we cannot
macam mana nak cakap eh like
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what ibu wants me to do lah
is the hantu remember
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little masih kecil kan that time
uh apa tu um aku rugi lah mm mm
obviously tahu begedil I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like oh I need to to control myself because
dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil kan
tak okay aku tak boleh tak makan but if I can
apa seh
even if people bila
silat ya but then we stop because like um
the penjuru is it the guru the head of the silat or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he campur with
benda tak elok lah um with
jin yes
no sister his sister yang ini kat luar I it was at sengkang it was at sengkang you know those macam got court badminton court ya we silat there
one point of time macam tengah buat benda sendiri ah and then like
tapi like I saw this guru and this student like a teenage student
um tengah terbaring tau
the guru is like macam gitu macam baca-baca then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like um like what macam dia sakit ke I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person rasuk lah katakan
one of our uncle also was in the same silat with us siapa tu ah ariff ah he quitted first and then we quit
I feel like is a traditional err okay um one thing I learned about silat while doing my research for my last time was
the their silat is actually
a'ah tekan
like how to say um okay selalunya sekarang orang kat luar kan dorang gaduh kan dia rembat jer tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu when they are in a battle
um they tunjuk respect to one another first and they you know buka bunga is where you show like oh are you ready
to silat then ya
ya macam gitu lah
last time they really gold the adat lah
various lah silat taekwando
as long as you belah after two weeks ah I don't mind
like being straightforward it's like just say lah like oh apa I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
like uh aku akan ambil macam angkat ah baju-baju kotor ni but some people see it as rude macam orh
uh so macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini ah aku kena buat semua benda ah kat rumah ni
ya the melayu so formal I cannot
ah no we only speak it when ada oral ke
with abang
biasanya with abang or ibu a bit lah macam gini lah like transition between english and malay but for hilah hundred percent english
ah I also don't know eh but um one of my friends like dia sekarang dalam uni and he is a
he major in journalist bahasa melayu lah so
language ya macam ada perkataan like tak pernah dengar and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so macam I feel like
bahasa melayu ni is not for today lah
orang dulu-dulu because orang dulu
macam bahasa baku kan
along the way people macam get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of dekat kau kena
lima minit short tak apa lah
