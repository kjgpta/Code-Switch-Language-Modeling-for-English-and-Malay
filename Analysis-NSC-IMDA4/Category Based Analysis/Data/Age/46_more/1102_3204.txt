<malay>tahu tak apa</malay>
don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
[eh] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti</malay> [lah] miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that I think
<malay>kita nak buat buat</malay> [seh]
(um) you mean before COVID where I wanted to travelling <malay>atau lepas</malay> COVID <malay>nak pergi mana</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> before COVID
(um) I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand [ah] most
(um) I won't say most value for money <malay>tapi dekat</malay>
(um) <malay>dengan dia lawa</malay>
ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah] I think [ah] that time I <malay>pergi</malay> in twenty
sixteen <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> (um)
okay [ah] I <malay>tak</malay> I didn't get to enjoy
fully because it was in a tour
<malay>tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah</malay> go camper van <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dengan</malay> go
(uh) australia I <malay>rasa kalau kita dapat</malay> camper van <malay>kat</malay> new zealand
confirm <malay>lawa gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi kalau macam</malay>
<malay>kita punya</malay> camper van <malay>berlubang</malay>
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay [lah] tasmania best [lah] <malay>sebab dapat naik</malay> the ocean liner [kan] travel from melbourne to tasmania <malay>tapi</malay>
(um) sydney <malay>dengan</malay> sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family <malay>yang</malay> follow <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> best [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> you enjoy more with them
there are shared memories together [ah]
[oh] berry van [eh]
ya <malay>lepas tu yang kita</malay> you <malay>makan kat</malay> perfect catch
<malay>tu pun</malay> best [ah] fish and chips by the river power [sia]
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to <malay>punya</malay> fish and chips fish and chips
<malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak sedap</malay>
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
ya I went to new zealand <malay>dengan</malay> my aunties [lah] and my cousins
(err) well (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>pergi dengan</malay> (um) <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang punya</malay> level of (err) worry is more because they feel that they are responsible [lah] for you
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
I <malay>tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> you <malay>dah dengan makcik-makcik</malay> I
(err) <malay>dia orang dah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah]
and ya [lah] so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then [lah] my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
<malay>dia dah pergi</malay> counter <malay>dah pergi bayar</malay>
<malay>alih-alih</malay> he was walking on the platform
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya (um) and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
[ah] despite my aunts' protestations
and ya [lah] so he jump [ah] he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply [lah] [kan] you got there
it must be ticked are you fit <malay>ada sakit apa-apa tak</malay> you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera <malay>benda-benda macam gini semua biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> fill
and once you are done ya [lah] I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
so they give you a cert [lah] to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and #nah# <malay>ambil kau punya</malay> cert
ya
actually for new zealand (um)
the year that I went
so <malay>kita dalam kat</malay> new zealand maybe about one or two
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so
my cousin and <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub
<malay>tak tak minum</malay> [ah] [eh] [ah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub ordered hot chocolate
<malay>kita pergi</malay> pub <malay>pergi</malay> pub (err) hot chocolate <malay>tengok bola kat luar</malay>
<malay>tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan</malay> it was raining
(um) and then <malay>bila esok pagi</malay>
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> (um) snow fell
<malay>lepas tu bila</malay> when there was snow (err) we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
(um) the advisory was <malay>tak boleh</malay> drive on the road <malay>dulu</malay>
and then (um) apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow <malay>yang</malay> christchurch (um) felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so <malay>macam lama gila</malay> [ah] <malay>lama tak boleh</malay> snow <malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err)
[eh] did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
[ah] was that the first time I felt snow
ya <malay>betul</malay> I think that was the first time I <malay>rasa</malay> snow
(err) unique experience [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> snow [kan] so
ya ya ya we <malay>memang kita tahu</malay> it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves [lah]
(err)
(err) not for snow but I mean just winter <malay>kita tak tahu pun</malay> there was snow that was gonna happen
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun [lah]
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch <malay>maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana</malay>
the tour company decided okay nevermind we (err) board the bus and <malay>lepas tu</malay> drove to another hotel
and (um) ya we basically <malay>tidur kat</malay> hotel <malay>baru</malay>
<malay>tapi yang tak</malay> #bestnya# <malay>pasal</malay> new zealand
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine [eh]
(um) winter obvious <malay>sejuk lepas tu</malay>
winter <malay>sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis</malay>
<malay>semua benda semua kedai dah tutup</malay> then so it was quite boring [lah] for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that !wow! at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but <malay>tengok</malay> so it was kind of boring [ah] but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night <malay>ke</malay> two extra night
ya
K [lah] how chocolate is the best [lah]
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
so hot chocolate [ah] <malay>sedap</malay>
<malay>tu bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> some pumpkin spice [kan]
[ah] apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
<malay>dekat</malay> queen victoria market [kan]
[ah] [eh] <malay>tu biasa pasal kita terus makan</malay> donut <malay>dia kat luar</malay>
!woo! #shiok# [ah]
!wah! camper van experience <malay>lain</malay> [eh] I think
<malay>kat mana</malay>
wilsons promontory
<malay>betul</malay>
dapat
(mm) ya [lah] I think by then <malay>kita orang macam dah penat</malay> I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then (uh) by the time nightfall <malay>kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan</malay> until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal [lah] having wildlife a wombat <malay>benda yang</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak kat</malay> singapore <malay>tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk</malay> camper van
<malay>melampau</malay> [jer]
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food [ah] [kan]
ya <malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah]
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
<malay>kita tak akan dapat</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda macam ini sebab</malay> tours chances are
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
(err)
ya
ya and I think (um) partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> your time is yours
(um) you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
(um) you can even decide on the spot that !hey! I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I think <malay>yang</malay> even on that trip [lah] <malay>yang</malay> we <malay>kita turun tengok</malay> the river delta [kan] ya
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak tak sabar tunggu ni</malay> COVID <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination [lah] I'm don't even wanna go
I just gonna shoot straight for
ya <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
<malay>jadi kita kasih</malay> [lah] <malay>orang yang nak</malay> fly fly <malay>dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi</malay>
<malay>kita pergi apa yang kita mampu</malay> [jer] <malay>iaitu</malay> K
<malay>apa</malay>
wanna drive all the way (um)
ya <malay>tapi</malay> okay so there are two ways to go about doing it <malay>biasa orang</malay> drive
what they do is they drive
to #penang#
<malay>lepas tu tidur</malay> rest one night and then <malay>esok pagi</malay> just <malay>sambung pergi</malay> border of thailand
ya that one more relax [ah] <malay>takde kelam kabut takde macam</malay> rushing for time
<malay>kalau nak lagi rilek</malay>
drive <malay>ke</malay> <malay>tidur semalam</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> #penang#
<malay>nanti</malay> [lah] <malay>belum buka</malay> <malay>tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar</malay>
#selangor# <malay>tengah</malay> highest for COVID numbers
ya so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu lepas dah tidur</malay> <malay>satu malam pergi</malay> #penang# <malay>satu malam baru pergi</malay> thailand <malay>tapi tu dah kira dua hari</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau nak cepat</malay> then <malay>tidur</malay> #penang# <malay>satu hari esok kita pergi</malay> thailand <malay>ataupun lagi nak cepat terus</malay> to thailand [ah] <malay>tapi penat</malay> [ah] <malay>badan sebab</malay> it will probably be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>empat belas jam</malay> on the road [ah] so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired [ah]
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border [oh] you see
so to me
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand <malay>kalau</malay> the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
then the other alternative is fly to
#krabi# or fly to #phuket#
<malay>sewa kereta kat sana</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> travel around southern thailand
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(err) I don't know [ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay> try <malay>tapi jangan bawa kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>jangan bawa kereta</malay> in
you <malay>sewa kereta dekat</malay> thailand
ya
<malay>kalau bawa kereta sendiri</malay> then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring [lah] so what I want is <malay>kita</malay> save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore [ah]
<malay>naik kapal terbang nak sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>kapal terbang</malay> [ah] <malay>naik</malay> [ah] <malay>kapal terbang</malay>
ya
true but then I felt that okay [lah] I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience [lah] of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship [lah] [kan]
okay [lah] <malay>memang</malay> best [lah] <malay>tak cakap tak</malay> best <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] bruny boring [lah] <malay>kirakan macam</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> kecil <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>tu juga</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> bunker [lah] cabin [lah]
cabin cabin
ya
okay [lah] <malay>tapi malam</malay> we <malay>kita tak</malay> travel <malay>malam</malay> so you were travelling at
it wasn't that bad
no [lah] I guess when it got
I mean <malay>bila kita baru-baru masuk</malay> when the boat started to sail
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
by the time <malay>kita dah tertidur</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled [lah] [kan] when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and <malay>dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat</malay> [lah]
then <malay>bila pagi dah bangun</malay>
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm [lah]
[ah]
[oh] ya
<malay>tak</malay>
ya I think supermarkets overseas [ah]
<malay>lain</malay> okay [lah] I mean <malay>dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi</malay> I think because of the space that they have
(um) there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
and <malay>harga tak</malay> so <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
because they are the producers [ah] that's why
[ah] meat so fresh
ya because they are fresh produced [ah] <malay>benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap</malay>
<malay>lagipun bila kita kat sana</malay>
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
<malay>memang</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] since
[oh] <malay>dapat dia orang yang</malay> burger <malay>ni macam</malay> best [ah]
true
even the ice cream is different
okay <malay>sabar</malay> which one do you prefer you <malay>lagi suka</malay> van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> ice cream <malay>ke</malay> you <malay>lagi suka</malay> gelato #messina#
van diemen's was ya <malay>betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah</malay> farm
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] gelato #messina# <malay>ada macam-macam</malay> flavour
<malay>tapi yang</malay> #amorino# <malay>punya</malay>
#amorino# <malay>punya</malay> I think <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>kejap</malay> I <malay>tak ingat</malay> whether that one were trip <malay>ke</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak salah tu</malay> [ah]
okay
ya I like #messina# better <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
ya <malay>tu yang</malay> best <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
because you have a variety to choose from [ah]
because <malay>kalau</malay> you you compare van diemen's van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> flavours are
much more predictable in that sense
it's not anything out of the ordinary [lah] <malay>macam</malay> K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
[kan] <malay>atau</malay>
K [lah] apple cranberry <malay>pun boleh katakan</malay>
quite common
<malay>ada apa yang dekat tu dekat</malay> tom's palette
<malay>dia tak ada ke</malay>
okay tom's palette <malay>ke</malay> gelato #messina#
ya <malay>ke</malay>
but then tom's palette <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
(mm) ya
and the best donuts in the world
[eh] do you notice
it could be ya
<malay>tapi</malay> it could also be the fact that
<malay>benda tu kita tak pernah</malay> try [ah] <malay>contoh</malay> [eh] <malay>contoh</malay>
when we went to <malay>borong</malay> market alright K break your head right
we ordered the the bombolinis [lah] the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
(um)
I I wouldn't say that <malay>sebab dulu</malay> dunkin donut <malay>pernah ada</malay> with their bavarian cream
<malay>tapi</malay> the the ones that dunkin donut <malay>jual tak sesedap</malay> [ah]
and
ya okay so <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine [ah] break your head you <malay>punya</malay> donut the dough is soft
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique (um) overflowing
<malay>inti dia penuh</malay> [kan]
so they were oozing out and okay [lah] I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world [lah]
which I am inclined to agree <malay>sebab</malay> about I haven't tasted
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya [oh] and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
<malay>tak pada</malay> I <malay>macam lebih pada</malay> okay like
I felt that it was a cross between <malay>lemak cili padi dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> thai green curry
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>iras-iras dia</malay>
plantains [eh]
did they grill that one grill [kan]
I think it was grilled and then they put (um) brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that [ah]
ya that one
[eh] there was something that I thought about (um) [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] (um) london (um)
the devil brownies [ah]
ya that was a random find [ah] no we went to that
that weekend market
(um) I wouldn't say it's a random find [lah] because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
[ah] correct
<malay>beutl betul betul</malay>
<malay>dah dah lepas tu</malay> I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den [ah] dragon's den dragon's den is this (uh) british show
where aspiring business owners visit this there (err) these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons [ah] so these dragons are
investors <malay>yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak</malay> shark tank [ah] <malay>macam</malay> shark tank [ah]
so dragon's den <malay>dengan</malay> shark tank <malay>lebih kurang</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay> [ah]
(um) so ya she pitch her brownies to them [ah]
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not [ah] but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted <malay>kirakan</malay> you <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
(err) she used that as part of her advertisement [lah]
[ah] but I really good are really really good
ya okay think about it [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> you miss the food overseas
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
no [lah] just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay [lah] when travel <malay>kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak</malay> most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam makan kat</malay> noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
[ah] noodle oodle (um) that's just
soup [ah]
right like like <malay>mi dengan</malay>
ya so if you were to think about it again <malay>macam</malay> is it really that fantastic
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>faham tak</malay>
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
ya it's the spices <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> okay imagine nandos
K imagine nandos [ah] so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
[ah] the price the price is way cheaper than nandos [ah]
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
so nandos [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam</malay> up <malay>sikit</malay>
[kan] <malay>ada sudu garfu</malay>
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab [ah]
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
[ah] yes
[eh] the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name [ah] a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice [ah]
ya what else [ah]
what else was nice that we have
[oh] buffet that that buffet was power
[eh] that was a nice chance upon [ah]
that was not in our initial plan [lah] because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
(um) ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay [lah] it's a saving grace [lah]
it's a saving grace because I think
(um) those ya that jacket potato was nice
that thick milkshake <malay>sedap gila</malay>
ya it was milkshake and skittles [ah]
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian [lah] at least [oh] that was some nice jacket potato
<malay>tak boleh</malay> replicate [ah] [eh] so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop <malay>kita masuk</malay>
K [ah] <malay>penat saje nak duduk</malay>
and baam <malay>sedap gila apa tempat ni</malay>
ya
that's true
<malay>betul juga</malay> okay [lah] maybe I think [oh] what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] factory outlets
[kan]
ya cheaper [lah] ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands (err) on prada
understand [ah] it's still thousands [eh]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> bicester village elite [ah] up [ah]
bicester <malay>ke</malay> #bister#
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester [eh]
B I C E S T E R bicester
ya but I think the york <malay>punya</malay> outlets (err) better [ah]
york <malay>yang kita punya kita punya</malay> camper van (um) battery <malay>mati</malay>
yes

so <malay>kita</malay> travel all the way up <malay>untuk pergi</malay> york
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
that's true [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> travel <malay>untuk</malay> two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that <malay>macam</malay> (mm)

but it's hot [ah]
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have (err)
two thousand let me recall [ah] when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
(um) we went to travel around the areas [lah] so we went to spain (um)
specifically we went to madrid [lah]
(err) at that time two thousand eight <malay>tak salah tengah</malay> euro euro two thousand eight ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah] euro two thousand eight [lah]
so (err) I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
(mm) ya
ya <malay>kalau kalau</malay> travel as a student
(um) I think you really have to plan
how much you are going to spend so <malay>macam</malay> for us while <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> we either just took the
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
<malay>atau kita ambil</malay> (um) <malay>kita ambil apa</malay> the the budget flight [ah]
so I remember there was one (um)
so we were from netherlands <malay>kita</malay> travel to belgium via bus
so when we reach belgium
(um) we thought that the bus station (uh) at that belgium to the airport was quite near [lah]
only for us to realise that actually
<malay>kita dah terlepas</malay> the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
<malay>jauh</malay> I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium [lah] <malay>mana</malay> belgium is germany
so <malay>kita terlepas</malay> so <malay>konon-konon nak naik</malay> taxi [ah] the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks [ah] ya
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely [ah]
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
(um)
<malay>tak juga</malay> [ah] we were winging it [lah]
ya
[ah] ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>kita cakap dengan pakcik ni</malay> [ah] driver we need to get to this airport so <malay>dia kata</malay> that sixty kilometres away
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour [lah] but sixty kilometres away ya [kan] so it's still quite a distance
at least <malay>macam</malay>
forty five minutes to get there [ah]
so you <malay>macam dah</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] but the worst part is that we will we had no money [ah] there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
this was the start [lah] almost the start I think ya
no <malay>bukan takde duit</malay> [lah] but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means <malay>untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita</malay> hundred and this one [ah] more than hundred twenty euro <malay>habis kita dah duit dah sikit</malay> then <malay>kita macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
so we negotiated [lah] we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind [ah] he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind (err) I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros [lah] basically
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and <malay>nanti</malay> I will show you all
<malay>dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni lagi mahal</malay> [lah]
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation [kan]
ya [lah] I I think <malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam benda ini juga</malay> so <malay>dia</malay> on
<malay>dia</malay> on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter <malay>dah naik</malay> two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
and then by the time we reach there he
(uh) maybe three quarters [ah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he said
ya and then <malay>dia kata</malay> okay you look [ah] at the meter
<malay>sekarang dah</malay> hundred three hundred and twenty euro <malay>aku</malay> off K <malay>aku</malay> off
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got [lah] and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed [lah] maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey [ah]
<malay>lepak hidup</malay>
ya starting <malay>tu dah</malay> adventure [ah]
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight [lah] but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
no but I think <malay>kalau</malay> spain <malay>kalah</malay> confirm <malay>raih</malay> [ah]
[ah] but because spain won (err) I think I think through penalties [eh] spain <malay>menang</malay> italy and then [ah] because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the (um) there was a big screen <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) live telecast
so <malay>kita ramai-ramai</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana sama tengok</malay> live telecast [lah]
ya and (uh) I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid [lah] [ah] but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
(err) I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think [ah]
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
the trains <malay>tutup</malay> [sia]
[ah] so [dah] happy happy
<malay>jalan</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>jalan</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid [ah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid so madrid <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> portugal so <malay>kita pergi</malay>
so it was netherlands <malay>lepas tu ambil</malay> bus <malay>pergi</malay> belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal <malay>pergi</malay> (um) flight to madrid
ya that was that was an
all the way <malay>makan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>roti dengan</malay> tuna [ah]
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] everyday but basically living frugally [ah]
[oh] I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
<malay>kita</malay>
(um) my friend and I [lah] <malay>kita dah dah dah lapar</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita turun kat kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni kita kebetulan</malay> found a muslim shop which was nearby
no
you go through your hostel dot com <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah]
ya
so (um) <malay>jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>semua</malay> muslim brother <malay>dah masuk kedai dia</malay> apparently <malay>kita ternampak ada</malay> #prata# [ah]
#prata# [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so I don't know whether it was [ah] an instant #prata# or #prata# that they made [ah] <malay>tapi nampak macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so my friend and I [eh] <malay>baik</malay> [ah] this <malay>harapan</malay> #prata# <malay>puas hati</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tu kita dah tengah lapar</malay> so <malay>kita minta dia enam</malay> [ah] <malay>enam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tiga aku tiga</malay> [lah] <malay>enam</malay>
<malay>itu tak perasan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] and <malay>harga dia harga tak mahal sangat</malay> [lah]
true <malay>dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita dah</malay> okay [ah] <malay>enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar</malay> and he couldn't speak english
so
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu</malay>
then <malay>macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar</malay>
no
apparently <malay>dia orang makan</malay> order #prata# <malay>dengan macam sirap ke gula</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali manis nak mampus</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> I think they <malay>tuang</malay> the sugar on top [ah]
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each [ah]
so <malay>kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik</malay>
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ni dia ni kira macam</malay> muslim brother <malay>boleh pakai punya</malay> [ah]
ya
power [ah]
ya that's why
ya
ya
and then (uh) you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita <malay>keluar</malay> (um) maybe like after one or after the two
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four <malay>ke</malay> two to five [ah]
[ah] like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
so it's okay [lah] as in <malay>dia orang tutup sekejap</malay> for them to rest <malay>lepas tu dia orang buka sampai</malay> maybe <malay>sepuluh sebelas</malay>
ya
[ah] yup
true
[oh] (err) in madrid <malay>juga</malay> I where where when we were walking [ah] <malay>masih masih masih</malay>
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> there was this bangladeshi guy
who came up to us
say #assamualaikum# and started to (err) to talk to us in malay
<malay>kita dah kat</malay> madrid [eh] <malay>dia orang bual bual melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>muka</malay> bangladesh <malay>berbual melayu lepak</malay>
so we talk to him when quite further in he said [oh] actually yes he's bangladeshi
<malay>ada pernah kerja kat</malay> malaysia
for
working [ah] so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then (um) you know went back went to spain to work [lah]
I mean if the opportunity presents itself <malay>nak</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>kalau ada kerja yang bagus</malay> okay [ah]
ya working overseas is something
okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months [ah] of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close [ah] but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome [ah] to the point that I felt that !hey!
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both [ah]
okay so (um) when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
(um) the or the muslim students association they were quite
(um) vibrant and there are very active [lah]
so (um) I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them [lah]
because when I were went there also (um)
it coincided with the fasting month
[ah] <malay>lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana</malay> I mean
<malay>kalau kita kat</malay> singapore <malay>kalau bulan puasa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tarawih lepas tu</malay>
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short [ah]
