apa you belajar kat sana
then which one which one your most favourite ah mana satu
my course ah my course is uh also known as apa uh marine engineering
like dia macam um okay so basically
like my job progression kan lepas
err apa err diploma kan is like working either apa the sailing or or at a shipyard gitu ah
okay for third year aku rasa uh aku what ah
so like um for me I I pick the shipyard job ah because I heard of like very good like uh what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing ah because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing uh bila kau sail kan uh macam
enam months like that
six month gitu ah away from your families lah which I don't think I personally think I cannot ah you know
but it's definitely something aku macam look forward to ah like in in the future ah gitu
then also apa eh okay um apa dia eh oh okay
but like I planning to ah so now apa eh uh my first year kan ah I only got to like try out the different ah so like we all can like
apa choose ah the various types of sports or
kat sekolah we you can choose ah so I for the for me I pick the apa floorball lah like something new lah for me like I never try before ah
apa eh uh
quite fun ah you know enjoyable your ah kawan kawan you know quite fun ah
apa sport I prefer
ah apa eh okay got offer quite a few sport ah
you know you got apa soccer and basketball got tchoukball gitu
but I I don't know ah for poly I maybe won't pick like apa eh
uh clubs as in macam
got like the engineering dia ada punya business
then macam
I was planning to join ah in the first year tapi
apa eh uh tak dapat like you must go for apa
like I talk banyak tau
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I tak dapat you know
but hopefully if I tried apply again dapat ah
like for your course other than like programming gitu
for me personally kan uh I enjoy the apa workshop ah not for like year one
because I apa secondary school I pilih ah what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology ah
so like for me is uh is fun lah cause it's actually something new ah some s- some of the what uh workshop practice or something you like welding uh you got the two types of welding macam gas welding ngan apa
arc welding ah something new ah then I macam lepak lepak you know
but err on workshop cause I workshop ah aku rasa macam four hours ah gitu
then okay for my course right uh they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like uh different kind of apa eh dia punya skills ah
err apa they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like dia macam ada
if you just go for interview eh no sorry my bad but instead of interview apa eh uh internship when you go for internship err what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
uh purifier room okay purifier room is macam like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right err you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test ah it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
if I'm not wrong kita will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me ah cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly macam like inspection you know like okay as
ape benda like other things I do other than in school lah
kay for me right apa eh uh in my free time I like to game you know
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right uh I start off with mobile gaming ah then I started moving to apa dia punya competitive scene ah
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two ah then the prizes macam uh gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
ya so you obviously ada experience kan
mm can lah you just you just go for it ah dulu
ah okay lah because like semalam I got study like the whole night you know like macam two
at three gitu I went for an appointment ah
how should I say macam
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say apa eh uh it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation ah so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like apa eh
legit all the makcik makcik atuk atuk oi all queuing up lah
gitu then
once they cut open they take out the apa
macam a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
apa eh
you suka apa
uh do like apa small business eh is it is that what you do
ah ya calligraphy business when uh like apa notebook ah
what do I normally do kat rumah eh
the apa uh apa airports cover business obviously not bad ah the business the profits ah ya
like the apa the Paris Disneyland
ya aduh
but but then macam there would definitely be still restriction lah you know like beach maximum capacity
but then again if like apa dia punya deadline is like
I don't do right then my will be affected apa
ah apa our school work ah ya
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course ada tak
like for this semester one kan uh I have this uh project called the module name is which is apa eh uh
so like uh we all macam is
uh two from then macam two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for apa uh
macam a few weeks ago before our final group project so like uh it was during uh hari raya haji right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to uh help them with something and present then when I tell them macam I say I cannot ah I like damn busy today I got my
they should know the different type of apa
err the type of programs dia punya different types of software ah to do like animation ke
tapi kan I tell you ah these guys kan is even the girls tau
they diorang semua they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of apa different type of drawing you know
is to help people with depression you know so like apa eh uh we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
more with macam err people ah online people online ah like strangers you know not in not strangers lah
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing ah like apa the apa the
then our app also ada you have err what ah you have the therapy consultation tab
since our app is based on uh like I said the apa eh the macam Pokemon kan like the virtual pet right
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins ah basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to macam what I decide to do ah
so like the shop right we also have a shop ah the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put err like the what ah poke food poke food includes like the apa
cause like usually my what when I go for interviews I rarely aku macam uh rarely know what to say ah
kirakan oh K K

we all have to uh macam go back to you know to kasi balik the coins

I think humaira did but then she just tutup balik but then like humaira tanya aku eh humaira told me macam eh macam mana dia kasi aku letter sia dia suruh kasi kau then I told her aku tak nak aku cakap dengan dia tak payah kasi aku then after that she apa ni she insist she kasi juga she give it to me then aku buka aku baca then aku macam you know lah I like you lah whatever then after that aku nampak rushaidi was like hiding and looking
then then pastu aku nampak dia tengah tengok aku sengaja aku koyakkan kan then aku buang dalam rubbish bin
dia tengok dia macam dia tengok dia dah terkejut tau and he was shocked lah then after that he uh but after that he still continue to like me and you know he whenever I say like uh where's my block my teacher ask where's your block all abeh he will story to the class dia akan cakap his house is behind my block abeh dia cakap something then teacher ask which school do you wanna go then I say xingnan then he also say xingnan

oh I saw kau ambil gambar lah
ya you look the same tapi but ada lah nampak difference
kat kindergarten
kau pun sama perangai macam eh
sekarang apa dah okay
but dia tak tahu eh
dia tak ingat he didn't even remember that
ya any stories dari primary school you went to which primary school
why korang never just start your name with like arina and diana
ya so sekarang orang panggil kau arina kan
oh ya abeh dia takyah surgery
kurang ajar sia tu
apa nak cakap like you grow out of this
ya last time I was okay cute then after that suddenly the you know period eh period pula sekali the maturing phase I oh my god I just look so oof but okay lah at least now I look better
ya but it was so funny was so funny literally funny gila
nice ke
sekolah kita is just not creative
primary five right starting of primary five I like this guy so much then I was I already prepared I rehearse kat rumah you know I rehearse how do I tell this guy then then I talk to the wall all this like pretending like that guy is the guy ah then after that sekali I met him in real life that time was Mendaki so Mendaki class then I told him ah I like him right then he reject me sia
you don't know who but her name was zulaikha I told her macam eh I like this guy sia then she she encourage me to confess to the guy you know I confess to the guy right then after that tak jadi then I told her semua then the guy cakap like he not ready all this then after that she like she cheer me up all this right end up you guess what two weeks later she got together with the guy
you gave me encouragement and all then suddenly kau yang get together with the guy
oh my god dia dah pergi dengan amira is it
see kalau she want to lie to you kan what is this
petty sia kau
zennis yang kawan dia iman tu she's muslim right
oh then kat luar it's already the swimming pool
oh she wear jubah
wait but right dia is she like religious
eh diam lah
buta sia
then after that why you all sit together dekat-dekat
but I actually want to know right how how you found the motivation to wear hijab like fully like what makes you
apa eh yang safi saw in this guy
okay wait I actually know the story okay tapi you just story I remember I remember the story
I can see that he's very introverted you know it's like very maacam senyap from his photo also I can see he he's a very senyap kind
tak macam how how you feel like okay uh from the start eh like when you just know him
have you ask afiq whether did he like really wanted to find a hijabi girl or
then how how you feel like eh boleh if I if the guy like macam afiq eh he talk to me like that he tak jaga my hati right I straightforward nah this is not the guy then I will just like stop it how how did you just continue
tak tahu ah I just I think my heart just not open yet you know okay sekarang ni orang kau nampak yang selalu marry kan you see like mira filzah also she marry someone she met a few times only
see sekali aku like twenty plus then I met someone yang macam betul-betul like god open my eyes
she can like him not for his looks cause he's more I saw his post kan he's more of those macam work kind of guy
that kind of guy the more pandai kind of person I rather more fun kind of person than
macam aku rasa boring though
itu ah macam I thought if mira with zizan right zizan is like he he's fun and entertaining what he don't have looks I don't mind sia
they say like charli you can just post anything what and people will just like it what she can just post a picture of her stoning and she can get millions of like gitu-gitu dah ya
abeh yang the bella that one she just
no lah you very kaku sia in front of
jom ah jadi agent rumah
exactly the rich yang tak perlu they get more stuff than the people who need need cause they want promote their products obviously can make this kind of people
eh not bad sia my only drop to two point something I think ni will drop some more
dia dah dia dah twenty one he start at nineteen
twenty habis itu twenty dia twenty one eh twenty
habis poly
then after that he have to go so I think twenty one dia enlist or twenty
let's say pergi twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty three dia akan keluar twenty three baru keluar
itu pun kalau dia straightaway like okay after this I do this after this kalau dia macam nak stop sekejap nak kerja
no cause that one is right I think is kalau I don't know ah I think because I oh is masters masters then you need that one to two years of working experience
bachelor is before ni kan before degree right
you should join before before poly my friend dah masuk NAFA now
so if I'm not wrong damn expensive though but kena kerja one year
he singaporean also he have to kerja one year and tak pergi sekolah for one month
tak tau dia kata tak dapat then he work starbucks for one year baru work
tak tahu lah dia suka ah dia suka
some more mak dia tak nak bayarkan he have to pay himself
abeh yang she study and she's good at it also it's good lah because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your gaji is two point five then if you enter with a degree your gaji is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know macam two point five abeh maybe after two years later your boss naikkan gaji two point seven two point eight I don't know
so is kalau I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two ah if I go for a hospital
so they add up together dah seven K seven K is enough
bagus ah
but like I think for comfortable life macam betul-betul comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
uh no it's the same uh like food but then another another shop so like she buka same shop
mana lah aku tahu kan
like I tried lah like my mum own cooking at home sedap ah takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing eh like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help aku macam I don't like lah this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister itu semua untuk buka this kind of shop
ya you know yang kedai yang ni she actually wanted to
oh ya you actually wanted to tutup the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back pasal her her work workers macam tak bagus her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
ya it's just like that I mean dia punya pekerja like the food standard is always macam tak constant sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap that kind
my mum pay monthly four K orang semua terkejut sia
dorang macam how you make money here then mak aku macam uh cause my mum she smart lah in business she smart in business she just put everything macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua kan then they just tell people then she just put on her barang
so she just take everything and just put macam no matter benda tu orang nak ke tak just put lah like kalau orang nak beli
tapi because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum takyah lah tutup ah kedai ni mahal sia
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this one you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill kena bayar sendiri
bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri then aircon dalam tu macam rosak gitu so cannot feel
ya uh tak dia repair but you know the thing is kita tak ada aircon ah the aircon macam tak boleh rasa then abeh you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
pastu engine dia keep trip ah macam dia punya mak aku my mum say can only open like two switches at a time abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat like two switch at a time kalau nak panaskan it's like very lambat kan
abeh lepas tu then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip kan tak ada lampu for like thirty minutes tak ada lampu tau then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
what the hell two switch abeh dah lah mahal abeh kau cakap buka two switch
merepek kan then mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup jer ah kedai ni then after that my mum macam sedih ah to leave the kedai seh like like the kedai then after that my dad already dah tukarkan the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad dah tukar we can open all the switch already then it won't trip bapa aku cakap they use the wire yang lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire
ya that's why kau buka tu switch jer dah trip
exactly abeh lepas tu bapa bapa aku yang buat sia semua yang the whole wire then he do by himself then like you know my mum already put in a lot lah for that shop abeh dia sedih nak tutup the shop then after that when we ask her to tutup she like tak nak ah then she say you know what if I continue to just open the shop then at least she say monthly she can still get three K what she open another shop then she can earn more what because she's interested you know this food food shit ah aku tak aku tak interested
jom ah kita buka sama-sama kau masak aku
right right kalau kita buka together then you can cook then I will be the server
kita how about we do western food and not
malay nasi
kita taruk mi rebus plus fish and chips
or like put like chilli crab punya sauce right
or we put um kuah mi soto
ya I can see you your love for soto ayam
that soto ayam
murah seh
malay food I like you know yang nasi rawan but that was so that is so good uh uh
but it's like at pioneer point I don't know I think can sit there and eat but then kedai dia selalu tutup my father always go saturday tutup sunday tutup then my father macam apa ni business macam mana nak buka ni kalau
pasal dulu it never close you know
mahal kedai tu is like you know that time they asking from sara for twelve K a month
ya sara says sara told me last time I was close to her juga what last time
yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw macam sara punya kedai always banyak banyak queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing macam you are trying to benefit from people punya business
kedai lain semua dah tak naik tank
is cannot what cause that is the person's shop what kalau kau it's either you stay or leave ah gitu if the person say okay if you don't want pay then you leave ah
you imagine eh kalau kedai sekarang ni yang that twelve K a month you think they can earn or not after that
and like apa the shop obviously the shop owner dia sengaja nak sara punya father keluar that's why naikkan tinggi-tinggi nanti sara father cannot pay then surrender the shop
kedai tu ah
tu jer that's all you know
cause they always keluar gi malaysia all this together
now dorang ni ke
is either at home biasanya dorang masak kat rumah then they send to the shop
ya ya that's why maybe they busy ke dorang both at the shop
sekarang bapa dia bawa grab pe
should be business tak cukup or like they have a lot of things to pay ah pasal dulu kan the business very good
then after that sekarang dah tak bagus then the father ambil car abeh ambil motor berapa banyak biji motor dia nak then the father buy for the kakak the abang pun all motor abeh sekarang business dah tak bagus how then he have to grab ah bawa grab pay for all this thing because obviously all these you haven't pay finish what
kena bayar so it's either untuk aku your if I am the father I will surrender the motor then just use the car
abeh nak bayar banyak-banyak how to afford
tak lah aku tak boleh ah
kau berani naik motor macam nasib kau afiq ada motor kan nanti dia
abeh takkan kau nak bilang mak kau kan safi nak naik motor dengan
dulu aku naik motor dengan aku punya kawan lelaki semua mak aku aku rasa mak aku tak tahu at all sia
tapi actually aku pun takut aku macam dah fikir macam kalau aku jatuh ni eh kalau ayah aku tahu mampus sia
it's not like it's not the guy's fault what you also want you also want to naik
the situation sekarang COVID
ya because got crowd control so ada banyak-banyak timing so
tengok timing lah selalu kalau timing jam satu gitu lepas lunch ah
banyak orang because they all rush in
ya ah then especially kalau pakai mask kan ah tu lah
ah kan ya then I don't know I feel I feel like I a bit rude but at the same time is just takpe lah eh orang pekak so biarkan jer
ah ah seh just to ah kalau pergi shopping mall pun susah kan walaupun nak beli like one thing only like bubble tea
kan kan like um so sometimes like we just want to minum air and then like people just suddenly stare at you like chill I just I just drinking water
orang pakai mask but never cover the nose like
ah kenapa
eh apa dia buat
mmhmm and then apa
basically okay lah dua macam dua alam like malay call it dua alam
I tried going on dating apps ah you know ya ya ya Tinder Muzmatch ya especially that so bila I kat sana then
it's just the way that they text the way that they reply sometimes I don't like you know sometimes like the way they spell certain stuff you know like you can just say it to me in like one long sentence but you have to kasi short form macam
uh they are actually quite hype they they they boleh berbual ah everything but
you know what I I don't really like you know talking to you you know like just ugh very cringe but it's just you know sadly some some of them are actually nice it's just suka it's just a preference
so ya talking about that tu pun
can still use your picture obviously because if not it will be catfish lah technically kalau
right so so macam kat Telegram or what then you send the video message thing at least they know like ah okay this person is this face but the name
lain lah but tu jer maybe your age lain sikit maybe your birthday lain sikit
okay maybe one of us who are like twenty one years old nak berbual dengan dorang then tiba-tiba I don't know kena
I don't know she was a minor because she never put in her bio or something and then who's fault is it you whose one handcuffs ah you you kena
you kena what house arrest ah that one
you kena the watch on the
I think maybe to a certain extent boleh macam
macam orang yang buat macam gini just to be like a predator or something that one is a no no
okay ah so hari ni makan apa tadi tadi makan apa
ah lah takpe sama I had the Nissin seafood one very nice
seven eleven one ah ah okay lah not bad sedap juga
eh apa nama dia
dulu bila kat sekolah it's just um
I had a crush on this girl so biasa lah eh like cinta monyet everything and then just macam oh my god secondary school ada mata air baru
and then ada lah kawan ni from primary school
and then uh well I have it's just like you like I had a sus feeling you know like the vibes and everything so so okay but I still ignore lah cause I thought like mana tahu secondary school it's a different ah ya ya ya like even though it's like primary six to sec one
dah mature a bit lah ah
I was talking to the guy on the phone and everything I selalu bawa dia ajak dia into the conference call like that because okay lah me being you know seeing her as my
best friend at that point of time macam
you know I want to include you and everything I do so like I tak malu lah ya so but then it's just the the stupid thing is that um
before before that night a few days before the dude and I dah confess so so we we okay lah we say that oh I like I like you too and everything it's cute but then the thing is we confess at playground with letters we roll each other letters you know ya right it's not over over text like I I state my no lah
so on the night we were talking and everything then I ask him lah like do you do you want to go to the next level gitu biasa lah eh you know I dah desperate kan so and then he like ah boleh jer like I okay because I suka you and everything and I'm like aww okay apa-apa jer lah so as long as you and I together
cinta monyet I just said it
ya but for us we don't use puppy we use monyet so monyet because it's ya it's playful basically because we
we see monkeys as very playful so like that lah but I feel like kalau puppy love is quite cute
where was I ah so during the phone call and then we were talking like that and then my best friend was there then dia dengar jer lah so she just like okay tak tak kepoh lah because I ajak so it's fine macam member sunyi
the whole school his whole cohort dapat tahu that
ya I mean that's how much I sayang her as a friend lah that I the first person that I look to is my ex that time so and then he was like takde ah takde cakap apa-apa like you think I that kind of person to share and like that then I was like okay lah mana tahu
after that we I just like okay lah takpe I lupakan jer and then
yang perempuan tu suka dia juga so ya hmm tak player is he he's just never been in a relationship before except except for with me
apa lagi eh so lepas tu
the girl that used to like my ex uh before my ex and I got together she she hated me lah cause I so called aku rampas dia punya
ya then aku macam
bro you you never make your first move how how is it my fault precisely how is it my fault also ya sure korang suka each other but if if I like him and then somehow he fell for me also and then okay lah then that means I I put in effort what and unlike you you just you just like you see from afar and just like hi then for me it's just like
ah padahal dorang ke apa okay no hate lah sia no hate but it's just
not spending time I prefer befriending ya I forgot the word befriending dengan lelaki and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends lah
because tak buang waktu sia like kau
kau penat-penat kau berbual dengan dorang kau lepak dengan dorang and then setakat they just like eh your friend single or not then like what the fuck bro
sikit jer ke banyak ni
deserves maybe you guys never you never end it off properly macam tak sedap
itu not
steep cut but kau tak cakap apa-apa then why why would he
I I tadi marah because ada orang terlanggar you know then like your girlfriend will just rely a'ah I faham faham but if you tell a guy is just like
setakat dia cuma langgar jer pe ah like that wait maybe maybe I can say we are too sensitive or kita overreact but
hmm tu lah get out but I got this story back when I was in I had this classmate she was very clingy gitu macam dia
dia dia tak ada banyak kawan lah because dia pendiam then bila orang
sama-sama but for her it's just how to say ah
setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam class so
kalau apa-apa nak berbual it's okay lah like rather than you just have beef with everyone like for what and then
lepas tu she became clingy then mana-mana aku pergi dia nak ikut then it's like ah dia dia perangai macam lelaki like she insecure lah because she she's afraid of people abandoning her so when I talk to other classmates she will just like
eh asal kau berbual dengan dia sia then aku macam
biar ah aku nak berbual dengan siapa and then it's like and then it's like ada ah project and everything so for project work
I had to choose ah I was given finally given the chance to choose my own group because dulu is dorang main ambil jer lah which
which was sad because I had those free loaders and everything and lepas tu I didn't pick her because she herself was the free loader
but she she she never realise because sebagai kawan I never tegur because out of kesian right you know like it's your own friend you sayang your friend and everything
and then she she text me she sound me and everything she say why why you never pick me for your group and then aku cakap
oh ah aku tak pick pun dorang yang pick aku
I bohong ah because I don't want her to get hurt but in the end she did and then in the end she found out lah ya and then she
and then bila tengah buat project then she will complain like uh you know akunya group macam gini macam gitu then
but that one I feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel tak sedap hati macam apa sia aku buat aku dengan kau siapa sia kawan jer
okay lah just share share sikit leh dengan
lepak bawah blok eh ah
okay that's cute I guess macam abang-abang ah gitu kan abang-abang yang bulat ah um ah betul betul betul
oh sombong eh ah oh ya that's true
cakap jer lah
so cili padi is like small and feisty and spicy
member kucing ke robot pun tak tahu
ah so the youngest all the very degil-degil bukan ke oh shit
alah but so high so high with energy maybe maybe oh but with other people a bit oh malu-malu
so dia dia tinggal kat rumah atau
kenapa kau yang jumpa atau your family members your other family members oh
anak derhaka ni lu dengar eh dengar eh
wow that's cute um alah cute nya tak payah beli bantal ada kucing
ah so that's why you call cili padi
macam especially
ya it's just it's just ayam masak ya that's true
uh apa eh
uh econs ah ya and it was like so difficult but we were on a zoom with like seven other students then we all buat the test together
we just macam one student apa tu one student screen share dia punya screen like when he was when he while he was doing the the quiz ah
we all help him lah do the quiz then after that then we all collate the answer abeh kita submit
but lucky lah cause like I never study my friend also never study then we just action jer macam like uh A A I think it's A
huh kenapa
um aku tak tahu yang besok deepavali actually
tabbouleh eh kat itu uh arab street eh
boleh ah
I tried before also kat arab street but
pricey kan macam it's mahal
oh is it macam dia macam cake right eh no
oh yes yes yes yes yes ya ya ya ya ya ya I know what I know what you're talking about ah that one sedap seh
oh kat arab street also
baru buka oh
I feel like eating apa konditori dekat arab street
is it damn sedap serious ya
but its like damn sedap lah when I go there like aku always beli
oh dia jual ice cream eh oh ya ya ya ya but I never try the the waffle one
ya wah so today you jalan-jalan ah oh
wah wait you pergi dengan siapa
ya I just did school stuff cause aku belum habis essay
bila submit deadline
ya so that's why ni kena fast game
ya abeh rumah dia
my friend's house tadi
rumah dia macam sejuk ah then I was like sneezing
abeh but if she off macam panas
the kipas not strong enough
ya and then we just ya we just had lunch abeh supposed to uh apa buat our assignment ah then she like uh penat ah
ya then I was like eh I come to your house then her parents balik her parents balik uh apa dining cause we were studying at the dining table
then the was beside the dining table and macam their sofas and everything ah right
then parents dia okay I eat dinner ah abeh just on switch on the then we are like trying to study
I think but she wasn't even doing work so it didn't bother her lah and I also think macam she
dah biasa ya and she like couldn't tell that it was like affecting me cause like maybe it does
don't want ah so rude ya some more rumah dia like I don't want to say
uh apa tu last week did you watch the soccer game
tottenham siapa eh I think
dengan siapa I don't know who then um gareth
ya then we won apa eh jap let me check the score I think it was like
ya but it was like macam last minute was like a last minute goal ya
ya nasib but we needed it because after the
second was apa eh can't remember ah maybe like
everton ke apa I don't know and then uh but only for like half an hour they were top cause they had a match with um wolves dengan
but you had school or memang takde
oh then but sampai bila
your macam when's the deadline
rabak pe
then um oh that time you mentioned kan ah yang you nak pergi tu
but okay so if borders buka pergi tak
cause sometimes like even borders buka like still doesn't mean that you know can go right
but dah buka borders belum it's still closed
but anyway um I just found out yang the international business students in my course
uh they are supposed to I think in their like third year they're supposed to go to lah to to study abeh sekarang border closed right and also the cases rising kan
then I think cause I didn't know that we have another campus kat dubai
ya I didn't know that ya so then I heard lah macam I don't know if it's true or not macam the students will go there
that's why macam tak
that's why macam like tak dengar at all right about dubai like corona cases ya so
but lucky I'm not student ah cause anyway if in in any cases macam both tak buka or both not accepting like foreigners then you waste your money right
I remember that aku teringat there's this um guy in my primary school macam he he's from new zealand ah
ya tapi dia mix macam cina ah dia cina dengan
so last time aku ada this whatsapp group
and also last time my english wasn't that good like it wasn't great lah and I like my grammar macam like
uh sembarang right ya then after that
I type something I think I type like macam
he oh sorry I typed if I'm not wrong lah maybe something like she have kan salah right ya
ya then I macam at that point of time I was like rude
a'ah mak dia masak tak lah we ordered food
ya then she was like oh malas then I was like okay lah fine just order jer
okay lah I think that time also aku dua minit abeh aku hit curb abeh dia like terus suruh balik
ya mine also mine was smooth also macam
ya or not confirm like lambat gila
ya and the pakcik
I don't know I think dia penat
uh like some allied educator dekat but it's under ah ya
it's outdoor activity macam outdoor outdoor learning ya
belum she just went for the english test
but I think the english test should be final macam like the final round I guess ya then she will know lah ya
ya then kalau she nak ajar kat secondary then kena ambil degree ah ya
I suddenly macam nak apply for
at first macam
tak my ambition eh dengar my ambition like when I was younger was to teach macam like ya like I always know oh maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout mm secondary school poly macam okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why macam I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
so macam like what you do
oh okay so macam for example
so for for example macam okay you like a company wants to manufacture food ah so they will come to people like you is it
oh faham faham
macam niche lah right ya baik ah
oh anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right macam
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know macam ambil duit abeh balik ya
as in nursing belajar nursing
but to be honest macam just take one thing at a time ah
ya I mean and she baru start kerja
exactly abeh nak ambil nursing
but it's tough lah I mean it's ya it's banyak nak kena fikir
no as in aku tahu ah
not in the in that regard but macam
don't know kalau don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
so did you apply for the for the madrasah course
ilmu ilmu apa eh pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat ah gitu
and kebanyakan macam orang
duh but orang muda ya macam our age ah
it's not a syarahan it's really macam kau belajar buku like all the buku tak tahu lah dia like macam ada banyak banyak buku
kitab sure like okay sure ya
but interesting lah ya macam some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
macam sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting ah and the ustad funny
macam he's like the abang-abang type dia macam just buat kelakar ah like every single every single lesson
not we are not rapat lah but macam
as in like it's not like we talk everyday ke apa
ah ya like ya we are just no but serious macam in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other lah ya
because macam not that productive
oh abeh
it's recorded ya so macam what's the point
if you wanna sit in abeh some of the students tanya banyak soalan and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching uh one of the videos kan as it dia macam just tanya for like like twenty minutes non stop
abeh lecturer dia boleh layan and he's a he's an old man lah so of course lah macam I think dia macam like
ambil hati and he would he will also macam just jawab lah all of apa dia punya questions
ya so ya it's damn unproductive lah but then again macam if go back on campus lessons only like tiga jam
but malas ya and jauh jauh seh tempat dia
but I tried going to campus before aku naik train
ya abeh kena stop ah dekat
ah boleh ah no
lupa ah lupa
tak pernah pergi but that time once I went there aku stop dekat I think bugis
err tak I stop at bugis abeh tukar
ya duh takkan I stop at bugis sia abeh kena naik bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like kalau my apa my kakak dapat then my dad will belikan kereta
just change ah macam siapa siapa like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no lah for what balik ah
ya fikir ah
but jauh naik public bus
satu kat kan
abeh the other one
but tadi I not tadi lah the other day I took train macam semua orang like rapat-rapat
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin macam they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think belum lagi phase two then they remove
macam just because like oh decrease ye ye o jer abeh tak ye ye o seh
mm kat mana
no tak cause that time I like aku lapar gila at like two and I want to order ah abeh like closed ya
no like macam ya
it has been right ya I get I think macam cause COVID abeh dia orang tukar
but that time aku pergi raimah dengan kawan aku
malam ah ya and it was like damn crowded then I was like oh I should have known ya
no but uh dia nak lepak that's why ya
then where macam like kat rumah kau ada tempat makan
but ya your place macam takde tempat like makan right
oh kopitiam macam masih ada apa
kat like your area
oh oh takde macam mama mama shop gitu eh oh
then besok kau buat apa
eh lah kau buat
oh wait so it's macam ah grab oh
ya but I think aku macam now that I'm schooling tak payah kerja ah
because susah apa
penat and also I'm not doing well in school
it's not I punya tak tahu jaga masa ah ya
not continue but like macam
aku rasa macam like everyone
macam lepak kat rumah all then so you don't feel guilty that you are doing the same
I don't know kemas rumah serious macam every single day I just like kemas rumah
like macam satu dua hari abeh macam last
no lah but now aku try ah macam exercise
no because macam okay that time I remember I was like
ya then my like my muka breakout seh macam
ya my muka breakout then also macam
ya right tadi you keluar
macam that's important
um ya nak besok
start sekolah
start oh tak
kan ikut time macam ya
dia orang ikut ah dia orang punya punya
I don't know I don't think so takde pun
I'm curious now how come takde eh
then your school macam usually is it two weeks
baik pe
penat seh I didn't know uni was this difficult
macam in like after after I finish working lah that
kan abang aku tinggal kat situ ya like macam just visit dia ah
tak um brisbane
ya but boleh drive to gold coast ah ya
but uh on the left or right dia punya driving
ayah aku just uh apa drive ah kat situ ya
and it quite easy macam I see lah I think it's quite easy
kat singapore tak boleh
kat singapore tak boleh
ada pe
sentosa ada pe
tak tahu rope eh
dekat kallang ada
oh ya life jacket kau nak pakai life guard
yes I did yang my dad even showed me a photo
are you serious seram pe
ya but I read somewhere macam
let's not look at western countries as like good places that like we can retire or stay you know what I mean macam ya
no I ya I ask her no I think I was like telling her lah macam oh I'm not so sure what I want to do with my life then she was like okay do you want to stay in singapore or like overseas
and then she was like okay for me I know that I don't want to stay in singapore that's why I study in cause I think she have plans lah to stay there ke apa
and I was like oh okay cool I mean bapa kau ada duit lah so boleh hantar kau belajar luar negeri
because macam our like surrounding countries like asian countries
macam for what
ah it's it just doesn't make sense to me macam
as in macam safety
and also macam when you settle down obviously macam you have family education here is much more better
much more better eh much better singlish betul
tak tahu ah dia orang nak relax ke
ya I think honestly I think they just macam nak that like macam kampung kampung ya they just want that ya that kampung vibes honestly
but my dad always like wish that he has a kampung to go back to
ya but I don't have but I do have like macam
um apa malaysian relatives lah then when we visit them during hari raya or whatever but now since like COVID cannot visit them
right macam okay lah
I think dia macam just nak experience not for youtube I think dia memang you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
ya I'm like macam don't post lah if you're living alone quite dangerous what
you know what I mean macam any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but berani ah dia tinggal kat kat hutan
probably ada apa permit ya
masak ah kat rumah mak kau suruh masak kat rumah tak nak
I I don't know ah for me macam aku tak suka um
but I don't know ah macam
western but macam I don't know
ya but europe macam quite dangerous now right ya
mm kalau I mean like
ya and the country also macam is it easy
but like like I said macam religion is the most important part lah so macam kalau
aku boleh like beribadah
but as in like he's he's okay lah gatal
guys kelakar or not
like macam he recognises the fact that he needs to relate to his audience
rabak seh
damn rabak
ya and then macam
ah best friend dia
I don't know but they say tottenham ada chance
but I don't want to jinx it to be honest because every time macam the fans cakap oh macam eh kita boleh menang abeh like always something else happens
and liverpool oh and also liverpool ada banyak players injured
so I think right macam this is a good time for other teams to step up
ya serious and like if they don't macam it's just a waste
see tengok man U is fourteen in premier league
jap aku ada extension
kau memang itu uh I mean do you subscribe to premier league
oh wait so now takde match ah

ya of course ada
abeh kau menang eh babe sorry what

to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch tak payah
like I'm not the kind who superficially macam oh if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
no lah I mean sometimes dia orang K when I say dia orang serious kan it's like dia orang betul-betul serious want to put themselves out there
ya like it really just depends on your rezeki I guess
ah itu lah
oh ya ya ya ya but like first date you terus want to pergi trekking
sebab you duduk side by side
jangan date orang gatal
okay ya I agree with you pasal the movie like
kalau tengok movie tak boleh berbual and then you
buang masa like if it's a date like like first date you know that you buang masa like dua jam tak berbual then like
if you going out to makan and everything
uh no I feel like trekking nanti um
macam very superficial ya first ideal date ah I feel like
and then like dia orang masak sendiri you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like oh ya it's so cute
the mat tikar flat lay yes yes yes yes
ya so macam if you think like those cerita like or like I don't know like macam
but what if like the guy betul-betul macam very disgusting very rude
um so I I suddenly remember pasal you did you watch the smart local ya
by um catfish K catfish tu bukan kucing ikan okay tapi so basically like

and then they will have like conversations bukan bukan it's not a cerita it's like dating reality
sekejap eh
many couples right only two got married tak salah I
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates dia orang dah beli you know
so it was about this article about this um malay muslim lady who decided to make halal mooncakes because
there are a lot of halal mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
dia orang tak sedar diri oh my god
then kalau let's say kalau kita bilang dia orang kan oh
korang ada chinese privilege or whatever kan dia orang macam
kecil hati oh mana ada mana ada korang korang ni just oversensitive lah
I pernah ada kawan ni
dia tak percaya chinese privilege exists in singapore
tak tahu because is is okay
so dia betul-betul tak percaya tau chinese privilege exists
habis dia dia buat this long twitter thread pasal
it doesn't exist pasal oh um
budak-budak melayu tak bayar school fees untuk sekolah it's very very cheap compared to budak-budak lain
dia betul-betul usaha tau untuk

boring to be honest uh is like the word like it it was kind of dumb cause kita orang kena bayar
untuk masuk the boar rides five dollars
they don't have the crews anymore so then the boats then kita orang pergi naik it just like a short it's like macam
ya kita kena bayar five dollars but besides that everything is like
kai kai masih makan jumpa makan makan makan

the whole time dia just makan tau I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god dia orang cute gila
uh apa tu apa tu kucing and also you know those macam couple couple buat video
no it's not it's because kita orang asyik tengok some videos pasal couple couple so the algorithm just
macam sedih kan

should have just kept it to themselves macam something not everything other people should be
like something are just so intimate macam I recently saw this video pasal
oh um dia went through
miscarriage and then dia punya
teman lelaki tengah nangis on the bed dan macam dia tengah comfort teman lelaki dia I think

she very lawa
she I beli her using my own money you know my own duit my hati my buah hati my baby boo tak payah lelaki dah just you got a new laptop life's great baby
you didn't do anything the entire day so perangai lembu lah
perangai what
okay perangai babi then
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I mata potek or like orang Apple mata potek I do not know like I genuinely don't know
so now officially girl girl is broke I dah tak ada duit I nak makan pun tak boleh you know I was like thinking of buying like
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke apa lan jiao kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa
lepas tu I
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like dulu kan my mum pakai tudung
so like dia pakai tudung then kalau dia nak potong rambut kan nak kena pergi to somebody's house you know to tutup aurat and all that lah
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit lah but like raya have to go to their house cause it's like some nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya some shit lah
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to pakai tudung in primary school my mom brought me there lah instead of like the normal kedai barber and all that
since fucking primary six sampai last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to jadi dia punya
daughter-in-law dalam bahasa melayu apa
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously menantu material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her menantu for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her menantu you know dulu right when I was like like twelve nanti benda dia macam kecil jer ah macam she will be like
orh like what do you think of my anak like that like nanti aku duduk like dia kasi aku makan nanti dia cakap you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
um she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2 then I'll be like like apa kau merepek like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I don't know about you ah but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and salam dia punya mak lah cause like I don't know why
then I have to salam the mum then
I salam dia nya mum and then straightaway dia punya mum was like
err kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua
huh sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau and I was just confused you know I was just like
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I sayang you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri and then like he's never there
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year raya and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading ah
like I tudung and all that
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son kau nak jadi aku nya
menantu ke tak that that happened last year lah but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the menantu that's all
kan I don't know it's just like a melayu nya thing
like makcik makcik be really all up in your face be like kau nak jadi aku punya err menantu ke tak
menantu like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good menantu quality like
especially if makcik got a son that is like freaky
makcik I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now
you nak I sekarang tak I umur baru dua puluh tapi okay dah
I okay I budak uni
I don't know what else to say I budak uni
I suka masak
like I don't know what is a good quality to be a menantu in the first place
is it so that means what when you just register straightaway kau pergi primary one like you cannot skip anything is it
tak ah the only the only madrasah that I had went to was Andalus and then it was only until like what
so I go and boleh pukimak kau dia tak tahu ke
oh my god bodoh lah so the only vocab that he knows in Malay is
and like adjectives like sedap
and lawa
gila ya the jiwang kind of shit but then doesn't actually understand what's going on
oh no the motivation is gone padahal nak cari ilmu eh okay okay sorry sorry
like I solat I got clear skin I got good grades
it is scan scan tu eh
ah lepas tu
so wait he got he tunang in twenty seventeen he putus tunang in twenty seventeen and then he go and find her again
you know you'll never know might like still sayang and like I don't know like
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to berak then you don't want to berak first and then it's just like
I don't know nak cakap childish ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham sia
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi lah cari toilet yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya girlfriend cari kan toilet buat apa siak
kay wait kau nya boyfriend jumpa mak kau sebab macam kena caught is it like like terserempak kat somewhere then she's like no
lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
lan jiao I've been together with a guy for one year my mother tak tahu sia
actually I also tak faham lah
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I tak nak main main okay and then suddenly I tak nak main main equals to you kena jumpa mak I
so like I tak faham girl girl tak believe it
I just tak faham I was just like
was the one who told my friend like eh I want to meet your mak
I just tak tahu
like he's not the one that you marry and then korang like wah full blown invested like I don't know ah I I was just confused I never would
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend lepas tu buka bank account
sebab nak kahwin like they actually like
dulu I would do it dulu I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
and you know dapat
tell you so messy perangai everybody semua perangai macam sial
I really never tried blue coral my entire life but everytime a Melayu comes by
I never tried it before but like the Melayu right god like the typical like if the Chinese walk pass you know they're gonna be like peach green tea lah the normal milk tea the Malays if they come right jesus christ they're gonna make me do ice blended at the back and be like blue coral smoothie chocolate oreo
the ice blend and I'm just like alamak makcik like I know lah like
or chocolate oreo like you the melayu the makcik be like
I mean KOI punya milk tea already nice
huh why you talking about milk tea and I want sushi so bad like girl girl nak sushi tapi girl girl tak ada duit
why is sushi expensive like why like kenapa
like they come dengan beras
mahal lah but like
nya sushi
shit lah like the sushi at eh not Sushi Express what is it ah dulu at junction eight ada
oh yeah talking about your madrasah
at the start I went to a masjid madrasah for awhile only like
masjid Ahmad Ibrahim
the baju is green colour and then my tudung is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya telur came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow tudung really not cute
the sekolah is in the middle of like a hutan
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku you know it's like maybe I don't know
my yayi and my mum pergi ah pergi to the masjid and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know sekarang I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
they will just say you know lelaki yang cium #Syafiqah#</P2 kat madrasah
you know dia literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my nyai will like talk about it to my mum
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama ah ada orang cium #Iqah#</P2 kat pipi and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my nyai to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a ulu place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my nyai
I cannot believe it ni perangai
bakal nak jadi menantu orang you know this is the perangai that it perangai
ya I almost said mertua this is why I cannot be nobody's menantu when I cannot even say menantu correctly
a'ah sia I cannot believe it that I actually took higher Malay sekarang melayu berterabur
berterabur baby berterabur
boy dia
mana lah aku tahu
like you nak datang rumah I ke tak you datang lah Mai</P2 lah is it
sampai macam gitu sekali ah like nak kena pakai voice note and all
cepatnya dia punya story travel
asal dia tak happy jer ke or what like what what's going on like is she not happy or like
wah shit sia I'm still damn salty about it like can you believe it sampai sekarang sia I'm just like so tilted
motor be like on the road malam malam buta baby who you fetching is it me I pun nak ikut
but really though naik motor is really fun like it's actually really fun
like the last time I naik motor was this guy who fetch me from work
oh wah not bad sia the job like quite chill for me I've been like searching for jobs because like susah lah like I don't know if what I should do with my life right now because I I'm contemplating between like design atau like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of bila nak apa itu bila nak bila got the discount right so um sometimes they will pick a fight lah but like uh uh I'm used to it already they will be like eh today don't have the discount meh you sure or not ya then I like uh
oh my god kesian apa like I okay lah because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the uh aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
ya I also got something like that because ah in we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right dia orang tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
like that means the apa itu the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
then lepas itu err this girl fadreena um I think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay lah I ask her to come join her also I mean join them as well so at first it was like okay ah
and then asked the friend to like teman her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately ah then after that right my friend was alone lah like she was left alone lah
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short mah so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt lah then she my friend like we like how to say ah err like she kena back my she kena back fadreena then fadreena not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like ugh
like uh the boyfriend is quite old not old but like a few years older then she also say about that like what my boyfriend all like old what is your problem then like just cari pasal lah with my friend then ya ya like she think like the whole world revolve around her or what
oh wait i think I saw it was cause if tak salah it was on his instagram still right like the picture of them together but until now he haven't delete meh
the little actions he do I guess like fold the clothes all ya then I saw he also like apa treat treat her right treat her food all sedap seh ya I wanted oh my gosh three hundred it's three hundred
kau serious apa kau serious
ya oh my god it's scary though cause the first thing right dia kan engaged he's engaged and then now he's like what he cannot move on from rachel when he should be like focusing on his wife kan ya exactly
not really toxic relationship lah but like cause now I I think her life is a movie kan like a drama you know no serious cause she got two guys um so right now she's in a relationship like baru-baru jer lah the she apa itu this guy like proposed to her
but not like nak kahwin propose that kind of type but it's like uh girlfriend like will you be my girlfriend ya but then the guy is in so like now she's like thinking whether she should
so now she's like deciding lah I mean she still she loves her current boyfriend now but like to think of having to go through the next two years is also like a bit hard for her so if you are her what apa apa kau akan buat
that time recently I think was just this week lah uh they had a fight then because like my friend right she called the guy because after like uh dia dah at night right they can call already right so she call the guy ah then apparently the guy macam like I don't know why like bingit or something like cranky
the new guy obviously want to beat him up lah it's like really because it's ya like I don't know it's just a bro thing then uh apparently what else ah he got the ex got also like macam maki dia
maki the my friend ya like on a tweet then also wanted to make a thread about my friend but apparently he deleted it so I don't know problem sia ya it was damn problematic ya
oh ya I cannot I cannot sabar so I just watch every week
oh tak as in like for ratings right usually they say ratings is for like we watch on the but for most of us is like we watch on online mah so I think that's why the ratings not as high ya but
from what aku observe ya from what aku observe right it's really like that like every workplace will have that one guy who is tua
like they should look at themselves in the mirror sebelum dia orang nak prey on younger girls like seriously
especially those yang belum legal like that's that's like that's like a crime
burn burn the anak
ya like macam mana kau boleh buat like that to your own own kid sia that's so sad
no uh ya then they say like uh apparently I think either one of the mother or the the boyfriend was taking drugs then it's can also be like the cause of why they killed the child because you know when bila kau ambil drugs right then you won't like know what you're doing that kind of thing
wah so sad oh my god I cannot leh cause you got see or not if you scroll down below right you got see the gambar of the child
ya usually if like terbunuh it's like you the kid is like abused lah like like
no they never say abuse but like um they say she just they she killed the child in like february I think then like three months later then they burn the anak ya
ya then the kawan also like a bit bodoh ah go and help to
ya it's damn sad because like ah the father the the biological father of the the anak right uh was like finding the child but then apparently they said the mother
mm tak kasih tak kasih dia tengok or like tak kasih information about where the child is or what so for like five months I think the father was like finding the child and then end up the child mati
sakit hati sia ya
psycho sial gila sial this girl is gila like gila
aku wah aku embarrassed sia like legit aku macam rasa malu
ya it's not on it's not like apa itu it's not on like purpose it's on purpose ya it's on purpose then I was like wow how can you like put him in a cage all sia and the cage is like a a cage for cats eh not even for like humans or what
they got other anak you know like they they got like the younger siblings leh I think
ya like like those typical macam you know those malay drama right then got the the evil evil fella
hijrah hijrah fund
then uh bastard oh my god itu terus just pergi neraka sial itu oh my god uh
then ya I saw the syed saddiq also oh my god he always kena sial when all the older err ministers you saw the syed
ya that's what I want to say also like because they all like macam oh you must because I'm older than you right so you must respect whatever I say that kind of thing right but end up whatever they say is like really stupid sial like really
a'ah oh my god did you see the kanye mess oh my god I don't know what he doing sial like legit apa dia tengah fikir dalam uh otak dia sekarang
I should just go lah and spend two years in wah rabak pe lima tahun eh kena tunggu
ya like most of them never wear mask and also like I don't believe the cases really like zero in malaysia I I think there's more just dia orang belum report you know when they are sick
ya ah how is he a how is he even a president aku tak boleh I can't I just cannot
oh my god he's so like apa itu macam what's that word uh he's so calculative ah kedekut yes
ya yang birthday surprise
tak salah pe
I mean like dah dah berbual sampai one one plus
so he and his girlfriend dah kat situ then me and my other guy friend
some Marvel Marvel punya like
uh what else I forgot lah what else ada kat dia punya package yesterday I I read together with them then ya lah
you know like my birthday that time macam
is a company yang buat
so this one we do our own ah like small picnic mat some food very macam
that day punya is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
so the the the macam deciding factor is
if the birthday boy bawa motor ke tak
and my guy friend ni yang the non-birthday guy
dapat kereta ke tak he can drive what okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend ah eh like
you you ask him lah go out for once tak yah bawa motor then I say but
because ya he then I say you use lah the excuse kalau pergi Sentosa like
parking mahal then he say but can park at the Seah Seah Im eh he always park there
boleh pass ah
because he did say he did say that uh she did macam bilang dia
my other guy friend cannot get a car kereta bapa dia
what's the plan ah sudah lupa
ah actually if you ask me frankly I prefer kalau pergi Marina Barrage
because dah dekat dengan kedai makan
just just so that macam tak waste time on the road I feel lah
from the other guy he feels that kan macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua if he tak bawa motor
I I lazy lah go through all that apa monorail eh
okay if we go Sentosa we must start like lepas zohor lah that kind
ya but then he has class ngaji so
ya so need to wait he finish ngaji by the time like two already then nak travel all the way to Sentosa three plus
kita kita nya more like museum attraction kind
uh apa eh
the girlfriend say ah sometimes he like penat from so he
then I'm like kalau he penat like you know
he dah biasa buat
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay uh apa you wouldn't believe it we wanna go Tampines hub also naik motor
even though it's like dekat gila
no lapan ratus lebih
to naik motor lah so cannot stop him
so if if he still macam go for ngaji then most likely is Marina Barrage ah cause
macam we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
dia by six sudah tutup I think
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be biar lah
you know the kedai makan dekat sebelah
I've never eaten there right so I ask him agak agak berapa ah kena bayar like how much is the
korang korang makan apa sia dorang beli banyak ah all guys
then she's like eh then I then I told her lah macam
worse come to worst aku beli air jer ah
then she was like kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air jer
yeah I mean if there's simple food like nasi goreng mi goreng I'll buy lah
ah like this type ah macam shell out eh I feel
yeah macam I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask uh mana kau nak makan ah
point ah I will tell them takut like penuh
uh I did say if we go Sentosa tak ya gi Marina Barrage Vivocity area ada pe then he was like tak nak nak makan restaurant atas sikit
Vivo uh that's what I thought hmm then dorang kata apa nak makan apa Mac then I'm like
kenal us lah cause she knows like
ya and she's not like malu malu dengan kita
she she was the one she was the one who said eh korang nak jumpa for dinner tak a few days ago then I was like
nak discuss about this lah
yeah then I was like masa tu I busy
uh we were in the same class tapi kita ada different clique
ah subset ah dia macam
abeh ada smaller group
hari raya ah hmm
the the guy tak suka the same person I don't like
the other guy also don't like tapi dia pandai bermuka
so sometimes raya also he never come then I a bit sad lah cause like I mean like I close with them what then only me and the other guy ada
ya no loss then he say it's okay uh I will go to your house for raya with the other guy lah just the three of us I'm like okay
ya I think hari raya is the only time that whole big group meet
Arshad say in the group uh apa apa kau kalau tak pergi then kita tak nak pergi ah
just go anyway I also bajet lah I spend
ni nak keluar for the birthday anyway I want to spend money right
I also macam don't feel like how I would feel last time I'll be sad if I never I cannot make it you know
I said that then then the the other girls they alah uh apa you never go then macam boring ah
kalau pergi lima orang then that one person won't have a pair if you take rides
no tak pernah pergi
macam company just another person
tapi three three people is still not bad
I told you what dorang kena kena buang kerja

korang berbual pasal apa seh
chey kau
okay okay faham faham
lapar seh
tak ah actually nak buat kerja ah like I have um I have assignment due tuesday
ya then kena watch some movies
like there are some macam theories and all that thing cause like up kan is about kau pernah tengok up
ah okay okay dia ada rumah ada rumah
oh yang yang that time tu dia kata ah socially constructed
apa ah what was it ah
macam make you make you wow gitu ah
asal asal still kena cause kau jiwa melayu apa
okay like in the future I kau
tapi like um
ah kalau macam like
um mix ah apa mixed racial marriages gitu kan then anak anak dorang semua mixed like muka campur gitu ah then
ya lah then it will never never end what gitu
apa sia lapan bangsa from where
like you are only from your mum and dad pe tak kan like you want to kira your nenek moyang semua
tak ada kau kata like it's not um
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's punya race eh tapi at the same time kau kata like they shouldn't choose so
like kalau
okay kalau kau chindian kan like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial apa tu the quota that one right
cause like kalau this one
dorang dah ramai gila cina
so kalau kau chindian then kau identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
a'ah I I don't know if like we can jual like jual to melayu eh jual to india or not
then I know like you have to jual to like
uh it's like a social social inequality cause kita minorities selalu
okay ah I don't want to say selalu cause it's too like absolute but
uh banyak kali
chey dipinggir yes ya yes ya
ya dipinggir is like ah macam jadi outlier gitu kan
um honestly aku rasa
so aku rasa macam
cause kalau tak ada quota ni semua kan confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation ah cause like macam
kau imagine ah woodlands confirm kampung melayu sia woodlands yishun
yishun tak sangat yishun maybe like yishun maybe like chinese a bit ada indian aku tak tahu
eh eh kau takmo
yeah um abeh punggol probably
I don't know macam cina maybe
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so macam all those like private private properties semua kan macam like rumah sebuah sebuah semua
dorang tak ada seh that's why like they can get away with all this like
ah like segregation so it's like in private housing private housing there's like the kau tahu macam dorm
that foreign foreign workers punya dorm so it's like
like ah for workers and from china semua they live together then from india bangladesh semua live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
um expats ah macam those orang putih then they tend to live in like bigger houses pe so there's the macam they are quite detached from our society
eh diam lah eh yes yes
um like I want the windows to be like top down kind ah macam macam gini ah and also I want a balcony that can look outside like can sit outside kind
then like malam malam boleh just
ada some ada some
kat mana seh

ada those kinds ah but I don't think ada lah so but priority is just like um balcony ada balcony and like with a nice view and like not the kind yang macam kau tengok luar is then is the the
skyscrapers all those right it's like kau tengok luar lepastu
ah not laut lah but more of
um like pokok pokok also

macam kau
ya lepastu like the main character say
asal kau kau nak buat on cahaya ah
oh okay aku I understand you
so just as long as kau boleh like your work makes sense
err cause sekarang we don't have any submission seh

it's about eh dia punya main character nama dia irfan seh
ya and it's a it's very like easy to baca and
easy easy to faham huh it's not love story ah it's like a sahabat
ya kau dah baca ah tu
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners adab lah adab
mm okay look before kita start kan um
uh okay macam mana nak cakap eh um
so macam uh sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana
ten years down the road bila kita dah ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
um macam for example friendship lah macam kita nak buat kawan baru kan
err tahu tahu
inshaallah tak
okay okay untuk aku kan because poli poli aku lah macam what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
macam mana eh um define
my course banyak cliques tau then um in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation kan so macam apa aku observe kan
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is dia orang popular and then they are
macam for me uh in my course most of the cliques yang macam the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people um they
they are closer to people that macam ada good looks semua so macam
so it's very very subjective lah in terms of macam mana dia orang select uh friends and ya and how the friendship last till
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so macam teaching ke uh
ya design ke ataupun like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
it depends beauty macam
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain uh like macam for example for female right they like males macam
the lelaki yang ada certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
aku rasa macam are we talking in like first first
um like kau nak share
okay uh okay untuk aku kan macam if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset sebab macam
uh for me I place I I put more I mean macam macam mana eh my first first
how do you say it macam
uh for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would uh my first check list is like mindset or personality so macam ya because macam
macam mana eh kalau kita uh kita tak
we are into only the good looks then like I said macam in apa ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so macam to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect lah so macam mindset and personality so macam personality and mindset is something that your bring uh macam mana eh it's like since yang kau dah ada personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset um like
macam mana eh what uh your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods uh rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality macam like for example ten years down the road kan kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita when you have your children then like if you
okay uh firstly memang aku ada watak a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly macam
uh memang high punya
dia lebih lawa lah ah
before we go to the next question I want to ask macam
okay okay best ke dalam topic of friendship kan
friendship bila kita buat kawan uh buat
buat kawan for the first time
to me uh in terms of boys or girls I would say girls sebab macam
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like macam their
macam the friendship is base more on macam
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly macam I mean
not to generalize lah macam like boys they generally talk about like
uh apa macam like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya
mm actually for that topic aku pernah lah belajar lah in aku punya course if like
macam what we think is a society it's not like um good but then it's still functioning so
macam is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something lah
rather than to have a society that macam everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of macam they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
disanjung yes yes yes
macam content is it the content they deliver
they they apa tu they are attached more onto the expectation rather than reality
lain macam extra
okay so for fashion um back in those days macam nineties eighties kan
macam the fashion do um I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion mm
err yes based on pictures also lah then yes it's very laid back and macam
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan dengan the fashion trend you know so macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now macam
we have like the uh what the term E-boy E-girl then the uh then the what type of new dress macam hipster hipster so macam
mm so macam
the no um the fashion macam mana eh do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
macam is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so macam do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
oh pasal journey is it
apa tu macam um right now uh
macam mana eh uh so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is macam kau ada banyak kawan then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is um ada ada uh ada value lah then ada macam ada tempat dekat society but someone macam just dia macam apa seorang
then dia macam pentingkan not really pentingkan diri as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care lah so like what what you think of like um this society standard macam ya
that was jodoh seh
we ngam-ngam
and I think for our friendship also um we are not that judgmental like in uh between ourselves so macam
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and kita macam banyak advice each other so so like it's really something
the negative side there's uh society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself lah since beauty was so macam
ada okay uh ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung
mm so it's like full package lah macam good looking very humble also
but I heard okay so that one is um macam kita kirakan macam uh role model yang macam
someone who is err so macam mira filzah dia macam actress kan
western eh uh aku tak berapa tengok
mm okay then for ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam uh pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam in your own
macam those not as
those not popular lah so macam kawan kau
ke or like someone
yang macam dia lawa and very like lemah lembut and all
it's something macam
ya macam uh kan cakap pasal uh apa tu
deen and deen and dunya so macam apa tu dunya means like world lah so macam
dunia tak di akhirat lah so
so macam aku rasa macam sekarang like budak I mean not to generalize okay but like budak-budak sekarang is more
aku rasa macam sebab macam singapore kan dia uh nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa
so macam the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world lah instead of like the the uh afterlife
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those yang macam dia ada dua lah so macam dunya and deen
so like more macam be comfortable in your own skin
ya sure okay so kita tinggal like a few more minutes lah so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
okay so aku start first lah so regret aku is to be the beauty standard so macam dulu uh secondary one primary six semua kan aku macam very uh very insecure lah sebab macam
kita ada influence dengan K pop apa so macam kita nampak woo macam lawa seh and kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua I mean kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam uh we are not there lah so macam ya so like what I regret was like uh
like aku terlalu pentingkan like kecantikan dari luar instead of dari dalam ya
um then jap
like I think message something like to to remind you during your apa macam uh bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat lah I would say
um the priority will be uh ke uh work live and
I think pressure in terms of like macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam marriage lah so I think
I think the pressure will be more bila kawan-kawan kau dah start to slowly get married so macam you'll feel very pressured so um my message would be um
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause macam to to to learn to prioritise
do ask ask to do macam-macam
err finish my practicum yay um I think semalam
cause I macam like you know
true true then macam how to say ah
uh so macam
in a way macam same thing as um
uh so macam meet client then um got assessment then lepas itu
then macam apa itu my office is literally macam just beside the units where they live so macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven lah
ya lah okay lah existing cases tapi macam apa itu
because sekarang macam buat split teams kan then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each lah so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak
err like we face shortage of manpower lah macam cause um this the err
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs lah macam two services so dia kesian gila lah like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time bila phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
so uh so then macam then she also has to handle the clients kan the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she err she also has to attend to the matters there lah so macam double work
ah so she kesian ah
then baru sahaja recently another staff left ya cause
it's not pasal itu lah like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
but I don't know lah kalau macam
err yesterday I meet up with the um lah then dia tanya I like kalau do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added lah if I want to come to the company and work then macam I don't know what program lah ada satu program ini dia hey just started up their office is in simei which is like great lah macam very near my house
I realised my tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila ya
full time lah macam err how to say ah they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird lah macam I was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there lah the staff there there was like
then uh what macam um so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the uh my my um the staff there cakap uh the is the one you are interview lah
then macam like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor lah then then she on the first day I came in for my macam meet up session dengan dia and my reporting officer
sampai padahal they just want to get to know me better lah
so cute ah then she ask me lah macam like you can go this option this option then apa itu
um then she ask me if I want to continue working lah at the same place yang I buat internship itu then I macam err not sure lah like a bit too far lah but
I guess it makes sense lah for me to macam continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then macam in terms of macam you know blend in with the team gitu like they know it's going to work
I think internally adalah macam issue sikit lah cause dia dah macam cause ada change kan so macam the difference in mm apa power dynamics I guess much macam mm
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be macam less
err hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program kan so macam dia um just suppose head of the homes is actually macam a bit restricted lah
haiya he's like he's the one yang actually main person to do the homes and everything but because um the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then macam like dia dah lama dengan kita lah she already do this kind of this job so macam when she comes in and station kan the office gitu kan so err I think he feels a bit restricted lah
ya ya can tell sikit lah
macam I think dia macam like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then macam cause he got his own way of doing things then macam like he doesn't think that we should do this but err in a way
uh then macam like ya then macam at the end of the day macam like I dengar two things ah like I think dia pun macam segan and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I macam uh then macam at the end of the day dia cakap lah like I'm not trying to supervise you
but um this is how it's going to work lah this is how I we used to do it lah so macam I macam caught in tau
so like uh macam am I talking too much
ya macam like this client he came back from hospital then dia pakai taxi then he kept asking lah
lepas itu err I want to
err be refunded by for my cab then apa itu dia cakap
apa itu I put in a group chat lah where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
so then after I uh I got the message then the head of the homes came and then cakap lah like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I macam like what what is going on
ya and then macam like it felt weird like macam apa
like dia orang punya procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
ya so like macam I felt a bit err and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm macam
I guess macam dia orang treat me a bit like staff there lah which I understand ah macam like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think bila yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff lah macam they they allow me to do a lot of things
I I felt like macam still terikat lah like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things macam I tak check in sangat lah like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it lah but macam
uh macam as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so macam like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so macam in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client tidak ada
so macam two and a half months actually quite short lah
ada one satu grad dip then the other is I think um under grad but err it's her second practicum
uh so I think this company macam purposely they take up err
they tried to pick up macam grad dip yang pernah kerja
ya ya in the social service sector so that macam mm not train lah macam like you know uh
work etiquette ah work etiquette macam like organisation after awhile macam a lot of organization macam structured a certain way
and then macam there's like cause I know lah macam like there's policy there's guidelines macam there's to meet gitu so macam like I roughly know lah
ya so I kind of know lah punya mentality where they go they a bit
they are a bit macam
jaga muka jaga face sikit like macam they expect
I guess like macam when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast kan ya so macam some of them macam resistant some of them macam they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or macam the society or the community macam thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report lah to government or which is lah can trickle down to usually lah cause they always report to lah
so then anything raise up lah then blah blah blah nanti in the end turun to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so macam be miracle lah miracle workers then kita cakap dengan dia orang lah it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time dia orang pun tak nak someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
and then macam how to say
dia orang punya is a bit merepek lah at times I feel
cannot be that macam one case worker has to hold maybe around
err I think last time apa eh eighty cases
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer lah they wanted I think hundred I was like kalau hundred one case sahaja can be like besar gila because of their complications is are they
someone who is very minimal macam susah gila it's because like it comes and goes ah each person kadang-kadang this period they are okay some periods not and then also macam seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like macam chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause macam I think macam
how to say macam it ties into their
so dia teringat-ingat the families ah or what how is your relationship with their family lah that kind of thing
you ketawa
for like uh macam reporting period lah ya then macam
but I think macam they try to push lah macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work lah it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the lah because macam
it's try lah they try to lah maximum I think thirty to forty lah but then nowadays ah cases macam complicated you the person itself is not alone kan then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so macam orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah
and apa
I might lah I I will I will look through the simei one is a new program it it seems like macam um a a duplication of some of their services so macam like
I ask them ah what is it about this new program that you want to start uh new siting cause macam I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs lah
err I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred lah so then what's the macam main difference lah between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very um macam apa exploratory
oh no no there's no need to itu I have to I apply the usual route lah
macam I'm not in the headspace to cari kerja sekarang
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters ke tak next year is like I I feel macam
it's not that lah I macam don't know where to go yet I don't know if macam is the place for me to do masters like macam after one year one point five years of doing grad dip kan macam like
is it a good place to start like to study lah macam their profs are good and everything but macam ada I don't know lah what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work
uh I think I macam orang gatal sikit macam I cannot
think what about your current job yang yang part time how is it so far
so you have to be firm and you have to macam how to say
approachable macam like you don't be the too nice person is usually is all strict first
then afterwards macam like then they say you strict right then they respect then you come in and be nice
it's the little things lah you cannot macam force your way into it like macam like
whatever you say you keep to it then they will respect you even macam as young as two they will remember especially kids ah they will remember
alamak teruk lah ya
I don't know I I want to do it that time then I think I had to cancel my appointment cause siapa eh can't remember so I had it was a a clash then I tried to reschedule then after that circuit breaker then my mum pernah buat ya ya actually I want she okay sahaja
but I I tak
so I wanted to go again then I terlupa then a lot of things happen kan then ya you know orh this year is like a very um happening year for me
on monday tapi dekat mana
tempat itu jauh jauh seh for me
is it not the darah one right
ya my mum advised me to go for the darah one cause apa itu
ya so she asked me to go for the darah one she went for the darah one also actually
you my apa eh
I can't remember what my mum told me tapi dia cakap macam you can you kalau nak ikut sunnah itu you follow which day eh
no monday ke thursday tak ingat but definitely not friday ya
ah but she went for it but macam yang this one this lady dia buat itu the female one she she she lives in tampines ah then she she part time major
think ya ya buat dekat rumah dia
I tak ingat err
I book I book the itu then I
macam normal lah tak won't break your bank kind of situation lah
uh no my mum okay sahaja lepas bekam
at least you don't transcribe yourself I I was apa itu part of my assignment one of it is macam to do process recordings lah then I kena record myself with a conversation with a client
it was so cringey then I heard myself cause it's macam I pakai mask kan and then I have to macam analyse lah everything that I do with the client then I was like so uh I hate this I hate this like interview so long thirty plus
ya I know I think ya I think when I heard my uh voice macam like apa itu macam way lower then macam
uh macam
the normal normal high pitch I think I realised my voice is the lower register and then macam calm like more huh not calmer lah macam
then will be like kenapa hujan siapa nyanyi
mm no ah it just sounds normal to me ya I I don't know lah macam ada ya
I think I don't know lah macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
voice macam I think it's the um channel that they go into so macam when we hear our voices during our
apa itu using recording ke apa right ya it sounds weird net factor
can't imagine we apa itu sekarang what maybe they gonna do some space travel kan tak sampai ingat who is it ah the guy yang faizal tak suka itu no
okay okay can lah I don't mind cause technically macam it's either
macam no err no macam
parkway parade or like you know north east region gitu
actually macam ya in terms of connectivity macam cycling I think in the east is better
eh there is a dekat tampines there's a eco green park town
eh I is this the guy yang you were the one that ya the one that you macam not certain is it this one
ya lah it makes more sense lah habis itu ya
then sometime macam like kalau the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes macam
uh ada lah fiction you pernah dengar
outside you and the mother-in-law macam okay lah bermesra gitu but
I think macam like entah what would what would I know also
tak macam ada like female macam ada expectations on us like we should tak kisah lah kalau you kerja full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then macam like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
mm like macam apa itu
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja lah kasih duit
but nowadays is like susah lah nak
I know which is like macam a bit worrying lah macam I think I tengah fikir-fikir because macam
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause macam at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility kan but then also
like you shouldn't segan and not ask for help and then my mm then my parents dia orang tak nak macam they want to have their own lives lah they don't want to be like you know
it's like the only other options I can see is that I macam berhenti kerja sekejap lah jaga anak and then ya and then potentially you lose
uh apa itu credibility um relevancy to the the area that you are in then susah balik nak masuk kerja
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband ah and then macam a lot of people tell me lah macam oh what uh don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent macam like what is going on
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good lah kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop
ya so macam
technically kalau nak masuk playgroup lah it's a nice timing to masuk balik kerja and then
I don't know lah macam singapore punya culture not flexible yet
so macam
which one oh dia
I only eat waffle but then I'm so full babe what what do I have to do oh topik topik perbincangan
sekiranya anda
oh ya I was watching record of you like this new drama of park bo gum handsome gila sia wah aku macam fuh to be that close with park bo gum doing his make up brother I want
he is with his short hair handsome gila sia

um I would say like I'm not a baby anymore I can I will I am responsible and I can ensure that I will be safe nanti dia terus macam no ah as long as you live under my house you are my baby you stay my baby
um not bad what you have to consider you have to consider your gaji you have to consider how much you have to set aside for like is being cut for example your food your home utilities
I mean like you cannot live there for technically like for free free apa you have to help out also right
I mean I think she has or maybe like she contacting somebody I don't know oh my god it's so annoying tengok besar sia this is my stomach
okay this is my stomach this is my stomach perut this is my babat this is like

tomorrow saturday cannot go out don't know my mom want to celebrate my kakak birthday because her birthday is on monday ya she will be twenty seven I think ya twenty seven
kat rumah um mm
tak tahu apparently when she eat the TruFitz is it helps to curb her appetite
and maybe because she maybe sometimes she eat dinner or like she minum air so it makes her full
kau takkan lapar because I ate that for like one week what and it does help wah I don't eat a lot in during lunch I don't eat a lot during dinner
dah kena skip everyday
pukimak penat duh berapa kilometre aku kena skip
so basically it's like a blind cane kau beli ah blind cane jer
bodoh lah oh my god burns
ini burn sia burn apa tu dia punya tu tak
macam ni kita kena berbual for tiga minit
is the one after naruto mati eh naruto mati pula since when no sasuke killed roshi maro and then after that he went on a journey with this
zabuza punya student I don't know his name ya ya with the purple baju ya I don't know his name I forgot and then with the currin and they went to find juggo juggo is the orange colour
bye bye I'm just so patty and then kau kena cakap
and aku campak
kau kena macam nadira macam sasuke like how naruto call sasuke
bodoh lah
ya ya ya because literally kau boleh macam gini
alright boleh
boleh eh okay so basically aku tanya uh whoever living at my place first to do this lah cause I thought need to do at my house
then I aku call siapa ham boy dengan uh I they technically live near my place what so easier so I call them dua dua tak nak buat
I actually oh my god I forgot to tell ham he told me uh dia nak fikir dulu
ah nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
no is based on macam first come first basis
okay basically err my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
sekali suddenly she just sent me this lah so I actually thought this was a debate
ah so aku so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I ah call you lah uh I was looking for people ah macam ham boy
actually one of my friend who stay kat
ah very near right tapi dia tak nak
like I don't I don't get some people punya mindset macam
tak kan satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
oh my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
ah actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want ah ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
ah always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
kita tukar question jer ah
tukar question
let me guess kau kene kerja for
settle down relax there K dah settled
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
ah but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita lah
six fifty nine I aku dah kat rumah
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
so they talk about the dulu orang Turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
uh rumah tangga
uh musuh
cucuk belakang and all ah oh my god I tell you
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class ah
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek kan two years in a row ah don't need study ah lepak ah
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class eh kita focus jer how to be best in the cohort
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
lepak kat luar lah ah tak belajar after oral
aku main catching
ah prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
past tak terjadi
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
yeah oh my god dorang punya cara berbual
some um country ah they you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
like dulu punya time ah
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
dia punya masalah yang betul kan is actually apa tau
life hidup
macam life is so simple
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
everyday activity lah bukan kerja ke apa macam K for me
nanti muak pe
and what jelak sama jer lah
eh kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi tau pasal sekolah
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
intuition that I can read people face so like I know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
like oh muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini oh macam gini ah orang dia
so tak ah so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
I expected you to be a super mat rep
err perang perang kan
so actually alamak confirm mat rep eh fikir dia siapa sia
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the apa the headmaster apa
course head eh apa
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa hamizan tak ingat
what skill eh apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
I mean I heard of it before tapi macam
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu kan cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
then you know his uh dia punya cara marah macam mana kan see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
takde lah
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops lah ni lah tu lah ni lah tu lah
ah definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so I can them like bombard them
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
so aku macam oh my god
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa lah hidup macam ni
it's for me is merepek ah like I I can't believe ah macam
K ah kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly kan what what's the point
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit jer
abeh kalau kat rumah I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
precisely I aku it is
I find it super merepek
so it it made me like oh you know what ah so tiring ah malas ah
ah tak leh ah tak leh ah
abeh come by my house lah one once in a while
eh kim cam
pergi pe ons see you in five minutes five minutes eh toa payoh to woodlands
why your apa engine so loud
yeah I never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit jer singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa ah
kalau kau tanya aku eh mm
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
if they give us like pre before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
like I pay for competition semua
izzul kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot eh sorry sorry sorry
no no no K basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
so my game and dorang punya game tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
tak kira apa-apa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in Singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
correct so parents aku suka apa tau they like err
air bahasa melayu apa ah
angin tu wind
oksigen ah ni dalam melayu properly ah eh
oksigen ah the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
G E N oksigen
kau punya okay ah let me see eh
then tak tahu dapat dorang punya salary ke tak
dorang punya families kat overseas macam mana
book reservation punya
kalau dorang buat ni eh kalau dorang buat ni kan
dorang punya tracking system pun senang tau actually you know what implement to all shops
dorang buat gini senang nak track orang
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai right
tapi satu masalah will be apa tau
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play takraw kat serangoon sana
because kalau if kalau kita lepak kat luar
ah kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa like we just do our own things
Italy they have a very big hit all this macam tourist attraction punya tempat eh very big hit
so kau masih kerja
eh tu nenek aku
I mean technically it's my sleeping time ah aku switch aku punya body clock
after asar to subuh
now is subuh to after isyak
okay apa ni kau punya time tinggal berapa
sixty mine is only fifty nine fifty seven okay lah I guess kita end the conversation now lah eh
so macam very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
if aku ada pagi punya kelas then she have petang punya kelas then if have if I have petang punya kelas then she have pagi punya kelas then it's like you really boring
lepas tu it's like how to say
it's very dry cause sekarang tak ada hands on cause of the COVID so kita tak ada jadi hands on activity
then I'm like central ada macam
uh childcare kat dalam kan tapi kita tak dapat pergi and we suppose to pergi so now it's like really dry and like err boring and all we do is like datang school lah habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
but then at the same time macam best sebab
dapat jumpa kawan pe
dapat jumpa kawan habis like
we go eat together sometimes tapi macam sometimes cause semua tinggal jauh-jauh so we cannot
do anymore but then college central still do but now because ah recently ada like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless macam is online class tu pun online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
habis lepas tu kita buat powerpoint slides about the muscles all lah
but ah then actually tak do like any like that is kalau kita buat macam project ni kan
it is counted as kita punya participation mark
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot lah from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now kita tak boleh buat so we don't do anymore then we have like
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then macam quite senang lah cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you oh your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing kan pasal
each of the people can there's like uh over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final nanti kau your
kau dapat when nanti kau dapat tahu ah kau do like well ke tak then after that for my class like kan you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good kan you have the opportunity to retake your punya like test lah but then my class tak ada orang retake cikgu cakap like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module tu macam cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say macam
uh in macam experience through experience cause we do a lot buat macam relationship management lepas tu kita buat the time kita buat like kita punya individual presentation kan it just
we in right this is the frustrating thing ah cikgu just go just go through
cikgu just go through mana part yang kita nak ada buat assignment one dia orang tak ajar like throughout macam in secondary school they ajar everything what even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and dia orang bagi pun
uh is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like kenapa budak ini nangis then kenapa ah dia tak eh separate dengan parents jer then uh what kind of symptoms
so macam a bit dry it's very dry
business writing is more to macam you write emails letters
then is easier in a way because ada multiple choice
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then yang section yang lain cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
we are like like you said lah this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april oh we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like macam how to say
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab COVID
tak yang mana eh tak boleh keluar sedih and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
tak boleh keluar cause mana-mana pergi tak ada duit
so mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit kan
and then like ni then can think about like other stuff
but they want to tanya you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
do like I I I just like to get it over with macam
senang kan kalau kau
aku like I can do bila-bila aku nak I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
macam I'm a I'm a bad person lah I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like banyak gila is the amount of like group projects right is banyak is like until like every week you tukar group you've just tukar tukar tukar constantly you tukar cause cikgu first of all like
the reason they give is because sebab apa cikgu nak kita meet
work with people they want dia orang nak tengok how
speak english or like other ada apa language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
macam mana kau boleh cope dengan working with other people
kalau aku group yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat frustrated tau
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy aku macam noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done macam complete ah cepat habis cepat kau pergi relax cepat kau pergi like
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like semua my project kan is die like hujung hujung last minute submit like eh but eh is good work lah we are able to provide good work but it's still
depends banyak dengan who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together ada like yang they are mm
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name ima cause he just talk malay cause he macam he's really a perfect
honestly banyak orang cakap is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
banyak yang senang like
senang for you to masuk senang for you to complete senang for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate macam kau yang classmate bo chup like serious like
tak buat kerja kan I mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat A even though gonna work is like so bad
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar math kau ajar one two three four five under ten pun sudah okay dah you are set for life in that career in that sense lah
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so macam
but then macam what they never think is that
really competitive you know like the other type that macam every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada like macam oh
they like the macam
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam I know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking lah but she's clever but rela also clever but she also don't think about ranking macam kita
sorry to say but melayu more relax lah
kita macam more like okay tak apa kalau pass pass kalau fail fail gitu tapi we try hard
tapi macam there are a lot more other races macam they are very keen on
macam competing macam hardcore gila ni semua kan so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning ah but we are learning it break we break up
more slower in a sense kita boleh more slow but
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school macam aku dah fail fail fail fail fail lepas tu bila kat the end aku macam okay pass macam I made it jelita bah cause I I do set expectation that are high
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up macam
I aku rasa macam very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
senang jer macam gitu then I'm just like oh my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
aku go into thinking that macam
senang like ni like it will be nak very easy
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid takkan tell me budak tapi tak nak observe budak tu lepas tu I nak tanya write report pasal budak tu then I'm just like oh my god I cannot do this
but dia orang ingat like macam ni senang cause kau jaga budak jer pe kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga but actually
we watch how the budak grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes cikgu yang responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then kita okay just besar macam okay lah by this age dah cakap actually there's a
oh I look back my slides right I'm learning ah I'm like tengah revise jer aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak and we revise okay that's actually link kita belajar pasal brain then kita faham okay which budak pakai which part of the brain when they are doing this budak pakai then we are just like oh my god we are just learning like
seniors mereka cakap from the first year
kau boleh tahu how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously kau dah tahu like you are like
macam it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly eh tak tahu apa-apa they don't know anything about budak-budak you don't know anything like
some people even like masuk early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how macam early childhood has
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
for the next few years kau ada job untuk dapatkan they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay aku nak pergi uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
I want to I don't know initially memang aku nak baca psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide macam belum decide kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam I'll pass macam how to say ah
poly obviously I aku tak nak just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
my friend said that in every like I was macam very when dapat pergi kan you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that apa tu once in your lifetime you must experience life
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but sekarang COVID so kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she bawa nintendo switch jer pergi class ah semua orang main just dance is like that kind of thing
all of us want to go poly semua nak pergi poly kita punya ultimate goal is poly
macam bila kau kat first day
dia orang tanya kau like um
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay ngee ann temasek ngee ann temasek that kind of stuff bah banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
macam susah tapi that
bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap okay memangnya it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
that's obviously true lah then macam very susah then I see you learn by laju so aku dah macam
oh my god I cannot take this aku macam dah stress I remember ah me thinking that when I do my assignment like oh my god is already so stress aku dah stress gila masa buat assignment aku tak boleh like sometimes kalau kau message aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku just macam
I cannot do this aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition macam I think itu yang susah transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in kat ah secondary school all these are the teacher untuk guide kau like okay kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni okay kau nak submit kan ni kau nak submit kan tu in kalau kau tak nak submit cikgu macam eh kenapa kau tak buat submit
ah kau nak submit tau next time tapi dia dia orang tak remind kau they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay ada exam make sure belajar tu jer aku macam what the hell aku macam come on man like
adaptation is how you are ah adapt let me ah I think most people tak nak it's understandable kalau kau tak nak
cause kalau kau dah badly adapt poly right kenapa tu like you kau tak macam you cannot get used to
macam I know ah focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like macam cikgu ajar one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner lah macam you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language macam mother tongue
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important macam but then now they are making like macam oh mother tongue punya base preschool semua kan but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's macam kat movie
like macam devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
punya like thinking how they make decisions macam mana then macam oh budak ni
like is like macam evil not evil lah
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then macam ah when we realised that it's hard macam susah
serious susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung just tidur I cannot take it aku macam kelas pukul lapan we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
kita back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you macam I think the
macam kau punya record senang kau record like how to say that time aku the whole way aku tidur like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so aku tengok balik recording okay macam okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff macam keeping balik cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap okay fine
it's just seriously hard oh you know macam now is
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
I have a older friend right aqilah kan a year older then dia she tell me macam tegur aku lah
what kind of people you want to mix around with kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan
cause biasalah cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada they're going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat COVID COVID ni dia orang text sahaja it's just like ugh I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation macam okay kau nak boyfriend tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay lah kau tak ada boyfriend
that's why I relax macam okay now I realise you know macam ninety percent of my friends that you macam
my close friend lah macam kau aqilah megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe hada you know she has macam ada boyfriend sekarang kan
takes a lot of decision tau cause kau one year kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak moving along with your life what dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah getting uh upgrading yourself in a way lah then kau nak you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
betul tak unless you have boyfriend lah but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
it's different ke so it's college lah so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan aqil kita plan lagi
ke korea belajar
then we're just like come on hada then she just said kita tak nak
she she doesn't kita tak nak how to say dia nak take a break dia tak nak continue belajar cause I don't think she prioritise
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys kita macam okay kita macam single sedih kan cause sedih tak ada boyfriend
sedih dan lain-lain but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy kan is bila dia bilang aku jer tau dia tak tahu apa nak buat into the future
I don't like aku macam god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like dia nak kena get dia life straight I like I find guys like macam tahu what they are doing in life right very attractive first
susah kalau nak like okay mm we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we macam get it lah but then macam we
who you are in life you know macam eh sekarang ni school decision um aku selalu cakap tau oh tapi some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are oh I'm like
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really macam put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
and then but the but then macam to me kan the
the aku punya pressure towards myself is lebih besar
so at the end of day kan I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because macam kau already
macam let's say I aku ada a lot of thing spent untuk diri aku aku ada like a lot of
I actually single best gila sebab kau first of all aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
how to say aku tak sangat
aku tak nak lelaki yang macam sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like macam macam I have seen a lot of my friends banyak bagi tahu aku apa everyday kau everyday jumpa
macam kau okay kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas tau
macam I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like ah you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like ugh like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
bila kau dah seorang eh
kau ada banyak freedom you know kau you can do a lot of things because now banyak of my friends that break up they are like oh my god
single is fun but after two months they're like oh my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then aku macam aku tak nak kan saya lelaki aku macam ah you know macam my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if kalau aku dalam relationship kan I would take it very slow
cause obviously aku nak date for long term
apa yang kau nak in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
most of last most of my last time my friends ada contact kan can go back with aku akan text macam balik punya eh ya aku balik macam but then when ah I go back home alone
I feel fine apa I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku jer tidur jer janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay kau nak you nak makan tak the I the best thing is aku tak payah minta not minta macam aku tak payah macam
like worried keluar dengan kawan lelaki boyfriend aku macam marah eh kenapa keluar dengan lelaki like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense bila kau dah free for too long
tunggu macam how to say ah
first of all you learn to love yourself back kenapa macam cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes bila dia orang break up eh dia orang kena dump they think that macam somehow ah what's wrong with me berapa muka soalan kau kan tang is like kenapa aku then you have to over that
like time where you like okay aku ni okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
kau just macam build up on yourself lah
aku faham ah in a way and then
cause fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri
then bila now I'm thinking like at the end of the day kau seorang jer during this pandemic I spend a lot of time jer I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
like bila aku dengar anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause aku just nak text all the time then sekarang macam I like brother and my sister they were sick ah what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam call boyfriend calling ni kau tu
family is important to me macam I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
how happy I was when I was with them thing macam
my family is a type macam
kau nak faham like kawan friendship semua
macam is not
anytime boleh end
walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang eh
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
adult you know macam
aku sekarang I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like macam ah she she like how to say
location ah phone kita like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like kenapa kau nak lock phone aku macam that kind of vibe you know then bila kita the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just macam how to say
my mum just like ah give me touch you punya phone
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
aku aku reply aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku phone I aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak hide
I have nothing to hide so aku just bagi
kenapa main kenapa cause he's always playing game
so dia macam very agitated tau so macam
and then macam kita dapat balik kita macam okay and lepas tu she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what tu bukan masa aku muda-muda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
and then after that she always like lock kita punya phone semua kan then habis tu when family time she lock off kan I was like but we don't ever feel macam
cause like and macam kalau you
that app kan kalau kau pakai more than eight hours kan dia orang lock kau punya phone tu kau tak boleh buka so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause aku sahaja I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend tak tau it charge charge semua pasal kita just macam bond banyak-banyak bond
so macam aku I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila app tak ada kan then we understand now kenapa
naturally now kan kita spend a lot of time together a lot kita tak on the phone kita macam I say to my mum
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night kita watch the harry potter series as a family macam
uh like at eight after my that eight eh like all on my apa dia off day kita just duduk habis kita tengok harry potter like kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam it's that kind of vibe you know then macam but when I spend a lot of time with cousins kan I realise that their families are different
macam they don't really tak kisah sangat pasal family dia orang say
okay aku dah besar pe okay like now what eighteen
kenapa nak spend a lot of time with family
shazlin dia family tak pakai baju raya dia matching tau
dia beli sendiri so pakai different colour ah but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink eh
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay satu colour jer
then we buy like same colour and it same with macam makan tau like it's like puasa right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night ah last day usually last week kan kita banyak makan take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then bila aku macam spend a lot time macam
with other people and aku realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
they dia orang tak macam
dia orang tak macam forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always cakap why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
a lot so macam my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like macam every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this
no because because when when I made the order dorang they asked for the ya lah they asked for your options like what do you want
okay ya so the cake is now the chocolate orange cake with Nutella kan ya then the macaron my mum biar dia choose lah cause different different colour let her choose ah but she cause she
ya the colour is the flavour so dia ada different different flavour lah so but my mum choose like the colours that are ah but the the taste the taste is not that different lah for macaron manis jer dia punya taste a bit a bit jer
tak dia maximum three flavours ya so so the bottom two the bottom two tier is one flavour the second two tier is one flavour the one two tier is one
mm tak
I ah cari-cari lah kat instagram
ya I read all the reviews apparently all the reviews say the macarons are good so I try the macaron I tak tahu that's that's the thing that's why I rather take the macarons cause the reviews a lot on macarons
nak order order birthday cake first ah
ya but then but I already pay deposit lah so whatever lah kita tawakkal jer
ya cake is the ya I think the remaining I just need to find out dia ada minta macam I think they ask for two hours time frame the that one I don't understand lah I ask uh don't know they haven't reply ah whatever ah nanti ah tapi that the cake is still a long time pe the day on the wedding baru dapat pe
I don't know I just cause their phrasing for that question is like very weird so I was like what do you mean by this tapi dorang belum reply so nanti ah just wait for them to reply
ya she want to ya she want to tambah-tambah lah
ya so biar lah biar lah dia mak pengantin
ya but he didn't ask tak I I called him actually I I wanted to ask about the package cause I need to order the wedding cake ya I I want to

ya lah I know I know tapi tak nak the thing is ya we want our guests lah it's just it's just my dad's issue thing lah yang dia nak more seats hais
ya but the thing is they won't get to eat because the food is specifically for fifty pax ya so kalau dorang actually for crew they won't get to eat
that's the thing so tak kan nak kasi macam kawan kita datang abeh dorang tak dapat makan seh it's not a buffet get it that's the part that they're not they don't understand
yang yes fine I can put them as crew macam like so that you get more seats but they won't get to eat lah because they are not itu pe a'ah the food is only fifty pax what
hais so tu lah a'ah I just ignore abeh after that dia tak tanya she didn't ask me but dia tak tanya macam directly after that bila dia delete like she didn't ask me my mum ah
so I like just buat bodoh ah I just pretend like
ya then she never ask me so I just buat bodoh ah tak lah lama lah lama lah awak jer

dia cakap dia cakap boleh aku boleh emcee tapi um suara aku tak sedap lah nanti aku bawa sham sekali eh kalau kau tak kesah aduh
dia menggigil nanti mata kelip-kelip mata dia err err err err aku tak tahu ah err aku tak tahu ah apa nak cakap
tak because ya nevermind ah just kita just takpe tak kesah on the day itself boleh tengok just see actually all these things nak kena tanya can you just write it down the things that we need to ask like what time we can come in to start prepping like cause the cake semua nak kena datang
ya so just can you just can you just write down first but it's christmas I think mesti ada event nya yang masuk
ya like when can we come in cause we also need to plan apa someone need to come in to look look see see first siapa syafiq
awak ya ya
ya actually awak can come with me jap you mak awak terus awak dah tak payah worry about is it
actually awak kalau nak you can come from the hotel also lah
entah but the this is kita belum halal nanti kalau orang tengok awak tengok saya macam tak pakai tudung macam weird
tak or you you just wait at home first bila macam about ada timing lah so make sure saya dah pakai a'ah dah pakai tudung and all that
ya then you meet me at the hotel baru kita datang sama-sama lah I mean ya I mean we will just gonna I don't know ya the thing is because dia cakap we have from seven to ten abeh dia cakap kalau bridal use the room but we also don't have much time before that what
mm not enough time lah nak makeup
ya ya biar lah I don't think nak kena tanya mak andam juga ni like like will you follow me uh to the venue or tak ya cause kalau tak dia buat kat rumah then lepas tu dia jalan pe
pak andam usually is your brides man what eh brides man groomsman
alah kalau gitu rizal tahu lah
a'ah rizal dengan syam rizal dengan syam semua buatkan hafiz pe
actually syam syam yang bagus benda gini syam yang bagus
syafiq tak tahu ke
actually saya tahu tapi tak kan saya nak ikat awak
ikat pun boleh ikat sendiri pe
tapi saya saya pun tahu dulu malay dance pun kita belajar benda ni semua cause kita pun pakai apa a'ah kita pun pakai samping pe kan ah malay dance pun kadang-kadang our costumes we have to wear the samping kita semua belajar pe buat flower and all that I was talking just ask the person to teach lah but it will be weird lah kalau bride ikatkan samping
but the thing is if the thing is kan when mak if mak andam is there dia boleh siapkan awak juga pe if you come to the hotel room
tapi mak andam nak siap lelaki I don't know
ee tak payah lah
I think ya I think it's part of the package awak pun nak kena is it awak kena tiga kan
tengok lah tengok my mum suruh
takpe I tengok kalau dia tanya kak kau nak pakai inai ke tak tak yah lah ah okay lah ah kalau dia macam gitu okay kalau dia cakap eh kau merepek pakai lah inai ah then tu makna terpaksa
tak perlu lah hafiz pun tak pakai
and lepas tu ada lain benda ah ah pasal yang food serving
ya cause after nikah nikah selalu berapa lama fifteen minute twenty minute
mm tak ah ambil gambar jer lah abeh lepas nikah dah ambil gambar
doa ada doa kena doa bismillah gitu
okay lah so so fine eight thirty nanti uh the thing is actually kita dah short of time tau
ya nak ambil gambar orang nak ambil gambar kita
ya abeh kita tak makan ah
sekejap ah like the last ah last last eh we are photo taking tiga puluh minit sudah eh
ah okay okay so okay so awak take note err for lepas nikah kita cakap the food is served at eight thirty walaupun apa jadi just serve jer because it's gonna be on the table jer kan
ya so so just eight thirty a'ah macam eight thirty eight thirty gitu okay start serving lah like once once dorang dah they feel like nikah tu dah is okay to make noise already then they can just go
tak lah
tak kesah lah kita nak makan we still need to cake cut okay
like okay dengar dengar dengar that's why I say ya we'll go by table that's why I say biar let them serve the food after this lepas nikah lepas tu okay just ask rizal to okay um now the food while the food is served we will go table by table to take pictures eh like each person ah
ah but first of course our parents first ah ya of course of course our parents first lepas tu dah lepas tu dah continue ah so in the meantime people come people go back and then just makan jer ah like that one time so once we are done dah lima puluh orang then we can just go join them makan tapi cake cut kita belum
selalu cake cutting first kan selalu cake cut is the first kan
ya ke
eh okay lah okay lah okay then then the cake will be the last because after that kita terus kasi and then kita kasi dorang then they just cabut kan together with the berkat kan okay okay so oo but I need to remember to buy packaging to give the macaron and the cake macaron macaron boleh bawa balik the cake boleh makan tak ah plastic okay lah macaron plastic okay lah
macam macam yang kopi ke tak kopi punya ah itu okay tak lah on macaron ya allah macaron
tak itu itu nanti saya suruh siti siti siti bagus siti kan baker
ah tu yang nanti siti nanti suruh siti tolong anokan
ya so eight thirty makan table by table take photo and then once we done we join bila kita dah habis blah blah
baru kita cake cutting cake cut okay dah jalan-jalan dah
so table by table kita makan by the time should be nine thirty lah tak kan kita makan lama sangat ada chance pun saya pun macam tak terasa nak makan a'ah lepas tu suruh dorang bungkus makan

ee banyaknya
dia cuma nak duit jer buat apa nak talk to dia buat fifty fifty fifty right technically it's including am dia ikut pe
tapi memang nak kena gitu kalau dah invite banyak you need to engage an ambassador to make sure that everyone is ya it's better to have rather than nanti everyone all standing at there in front and then kena saman might as well you hire an ambassador to make sure everyone is abiding with the safe entry rule ya lah
dia boleh buat cuma siapa nak jaga macam shah ibrahim easy dia hire an ambassador that's his way tapi kita ah bila kita buat siap nak
oo I remember the question that I want to ask tukang ambil temperature

ah just ask awak just ask put down and just ask jangan I think I think nanti saya datang eh don't have anyone ya it's err you need to ask someone from your side to do it barangkali banyak gitu pe
I don't think so cause dia tak minta dia tak kesah kalau submit name I think hotel hotel yes macam restaurant ke
I ya we really need someone to jaga the tempat seh I think rahmat have to do it I think rahmat have to do it jaga-jaga macam nanti orang datang oh cik eh cik duduk kat sini eh cik duduk kat situ eh atau atau beforehand beforehand kita buat allocation and then we update them okay you be seated at table what table what that's why we need I put I put first thirty first october is their last date to so first november kita confirm everything we assign wherever and then we can send out like send again lah macam their confirmed punya table if any changes please let us know beforehand so we can make necessary changes and all that
then wait nanti after merisik I think um the week saturday we can send out the invitation lah
can merisik is on fourth october which is sunday then the following saturday can send out the invitation so we got one week to print out whichever siapa-siapa yang awak nak kasi the hard copy then we can print out
I will I share with you ah eh got google this I dah buat schedule perangai perangai production manager cause I'm like I tengok I need to see the dates huh
ya that's why now I use mine ah I already apa apply eh pakai twenty four hours tu ya I already put it so nanti on the card ya I will just tell them to search my name ah
because when I search I dah try I signed out from YouTube and then I try searching my name just nice keluar everything mine right my account
tak I actually don't know how it works ah
I just for me pakai for me just use laptop camera can already but you awak yang nak
biar ah bukannya kita nampak it's the screen is going to be so small we're gonna be far away from the laptop
okay lor so it means you what you're trying to say is the camera tak payah like be connected to the laptop
eh besok awak kerja kan
mana tahu sometimes you go site you take a while what
entah lah
tapi fajr takut dengan mak dia mak dia marah dia diam dia ni tak dia ni jawab balik
cannot ah mesti have to dorang nak kena takut takut they need to know the consequences of their wrongdoing macam zurai tak pukul langsung
ya lah ya pukul just to dorang rasa dia punya pahit ah macam ow
nak kena sakit sikit jer
I I tengok terus I tertidur
tapi ya lah like let's same ah like my my brothers can do whatever they want perempuan aje like the rules only ya because they're they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya lah dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap ah biar ah dorang lelaki
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners ah like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered macam wow a man ya tu ah
or is it it comes from the western ah so orang tengok macam gitu kan
the children the the children will tengok at how their parents are ah nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam if let's say dorang nampak the father kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti they also know they will do that to the girls also
it's no lah sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because sekarang perempuan semua they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya perempuan perempuan wants the same status and rank as the guy so macam ya sekarang wives apa
tapi women now don't want to show that women need men
ya sekarang susah
I think it's okay it's okay kalau women want to be independent but ya but at least show lah kasi like give and take
tak sayang ah tu
ya they don't have time to dia you know you know I saw I read something like I think we should do it lah when we get married dia cakap tak I read somewhere it's macam an advice dia cakap how to keep your marriage alive or macam not there dia cakap make sure once a week at least once a week you go out go for a dinner a'ah then at least once a month go for a staycation or something once a month macam go for like like a someone further away somewhere further
tak okay okay okay once once a week go out with your family together with your kids once a month have a one to one date a'ah lepas tu once a year go overseas with the with the whole family this is how you keep ya ya so at least walaupun like you have children once a month you are having dates so every once a month if if any time between the first month and the second month your your love macam die sikit ah you will macam you will refresh your dating days a'ah so at least every once a month every once a month you are lighting up the candle you're lighting up the candle ah so at least diam eh ya so that so I think it's a very good advice seh macam I think ya it's it's it ya cause the thing is sekarang a lot of people
but ya but when things happen dah susah
tak lah don't have to be tak don't have to macam go out macam overseas as in pergi dekat dekat pun tak kesah macam malaysia you know that kind of thing ya just somewhere lah
ya it's about macam kita macam keluar once a week bring your children out is macam gi bawah main-main ke a'ah just macam every sunday ya so macam picnic ke bring your own food ah pastu macam bila dating pun tak suruh pergi mana-mana mahal macam just go out dating jer huh ya just go out like apa
ya that is the daily that's the daily punya cure ah tapi susah because I think everyone is working tapi dorang cakap kan dorang cakap kalau let's say suami dia actually dah solat abeh bini dia nak solat suami tu boleh solat lagi just to imamkan dia something like that kan macam let's say kalau wife wife dia dah solat sekali lelaki dia datang
ah lepas tu lelaki let's say the husband datang balik balik dari kerja it's okay that the wife solat lagi dengan dia just so ah suami dia macam just boleh solat jemaah lah with the wife
nanti balik ah imamkan
sekarang ya the thing is sekarang cakap senang nanti mesti ada dugaan dia bisikan syaitan tak payah lah tak payah solat jemaah pergi solat sendiri-sendiri sudah dah apa ayah why you never pray what time already siapa anak siapa anak syafiq eh ayah what time already
tak lah dengan mak bapa dia dorang sendiri-sendiri dengan awak jer dengan kita jer nak solat dengan kita tapi dorang kat rumah sendiri-sendiri
I definitely eat rendang
rendang actually that's a good question why tau because
I selalu makan rendang
hari raya but then mak mak
mak always masak like anytime she wants
so when she everytime masak I everytime makan and I love the taste of rendang
so I makan everyday ah
dua bulan makan rendang straight
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe petang makan with roti then malam makan dengan noodle
ya lah ketupat is the best lah definitely
you put serunding oof
actually kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan noodles and like
you had lemak cili api pasta
sedap je lah cakap
sendu lain lah
macam step know it all ah
kirakan the big shot ah
people yang ego
so macam
I just can't stand kalau orang nak macam nak step besar ah nak step orang yang nak step I really just cannot
kirakan dia champion ah kirakan dia champion
more better lebih baik
then hidup tak ada objective
tak ada makna ya because for example if someone
work in terms of because orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu
ya so macam
ah so macam buang masa ah hidup
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed banyak banyak industry he dah masuk he fail banyak
and then after the dia dah buat the apprenticeship dengan tattoo artist dia buka kedai dia sendiri
at forty five and kedai dia successful
you rasa you
dah puas with the thing you buat kan
if not sampai bila bila pun kan you tak akan
dapat that this is the life that I want
all that thing yang you dah explore remain inside your body
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff kan you know I did all traditional stuff
and susah untuk kita nak
that society punya ape tu what do you call it requirement
yeah you go first ah I tak tahu apa nak
because melayu always masak with agak agak
so it's nice when it's agak agak
I want the rendang italian
mana-mana ah
my most memorable meal was your macaroni goreng
your macaroni goreng
and we ate dekat stadium
dekat lantai because we like we just that time I think that was the first few dates that we had kan
like you just cook macaroni goreng for me and then kita duduk dekat
right dekat stadium punya entrance
and then we just sat there and people were like taking bicycle around lari lah apa lah buat exercise lah
we wanted to go kallang wave mall and lepak dekat waterfront punya tempat tu
zaman bila kita pergi ice-skating
I tak ingat lah
I tak ingat
I think so eh no kallang wave mana ada movie
ni hundred need to lookout ya you can see it it's gonna be huge
imagine you get you a hundred lipas ee
yeah yeah kan I cakap
rendang because that's what I deserve
so so you rejected my rendang answer but you gave me kari ayam
apa sia get ignorance
all my punya members lah and even my friends
they say when I masuk dalam bilik
makan oho
if I nak pilih satu eh
you pilih dulu ah I think I know yours
yes please there's another outlet kan
I thought dah buka
somewhere in the west eh or center I tak ingat I know it's not in the east
a'ah seh sedap seh itu
muak because of the cheese dalam dia punya daging
sekarang nak masuk airport leceh ah
buat lawak eh
you doa lah I got car
try kalau pergi changi airport parah baby
because changi airport punya car park kan
so kalau kita gi Shake Shack boleh makan kasi habis five minute okay ah
yours is yellow kan
apa good energy
apa superpower itu
I would say the power to control my kentut without having stomachache
orang nampak me
you know what's a death note kan
which avatar yang botak ke yang biru
oh yang botak eh
tak ada tak ada backup on that statement just because dia budak botak you tak suka
dia macam Ipin with power
badang stuff
ya then then I tak gi mana mana ah
you tak keluar eh
you tak keluar jugak eh
I thought you say you dah catch up already
tomorrow confirm if keluar ramai orang seh
dia makan taugeh macam makan keropok
after she wash right while she's cooking and waiting for the other things to siap right she just take the taugeh and put inside her mouth like is potato chip
rosak eh the lidah
that time yang you buat kan
but that one the dashyat
dia dashyat gila punya lah masin
percussion tu main music
if you minum Boost you kenyang
so you minum Boost yang besar punya that time I always like drink Boost for my dinner
in the morning I eat all the normal normal stuff then malam I just like
sebat Boost jer
macam waste of money
iphone eleven dalam one thousand plus ah
so if kalau tambah plus atau yang eh sorry iphone pro eh iphone pro dengan iphone pro max
yang tu kena check dulu like dia punya harga berapa
oh so I think tengok tempat dia plan jer lah tengok macam mana dia punya plan dia berapa gigabyte
berapa incoming call free semua like
dia punya specs ah
hmm tengok benefit benefit dia
but currently you use what phone currently pakai phone apa
ya ya our saudara
alamak drill ah buto sorry sorry pause
yang iphone eleven tu uh you plan to take which plan
tu full price ah no contract ah
oh actually iphone seven also not bad tapi I I would suggest iphone eight ah because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone ah
I think tu paling terbaik lah kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan iphone eleven is really good enough ah
ya so that one that time was during COVID kan so sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab
iya lah sebab COVID kan so not to get more consumer to buy the phone lah at a cheaper price ya
even ah android phone pun sama lah like google the new google apa pixel kan they they make it cheaper lah but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit kurang lah compared to the previous one ya
must check the new iphone right jap eh let me check eh
it has a better bionic chip the apa it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
ya they are still selling I mean um you must check you must check takpe ah ustaz tengah check
takpe ah ustaz kena check dia punya iphone punya iphone store
iphone X eh iphone X jap jap jap there's a face iphone
oh our ni eh parents eh
I think biasa ah mum is sleeping then I think bapak baru balik ya and
ah bapak kerja ah dekat ni lah iya dia kerja ni lah hari ni kerja pe hari ni hari rabu kan
tak lah I think he working three times a week
tu I think paling penting ah so like macam nanti um once I've started working
kalau tak nanti macam before this kerja macam tak prepare sangat setakat apa
macam relax relax tapi nanti end up macam tak belajar apa-apa macam cause
apa start started working kan you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing kan so you need to
for coding ah ya so basically it's not that hard lah because really we can just uh search up in the in the apa
ya ya some some some apa some company kan they
they know ah whether you you've you search online ke tak lah cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important ah it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice ah you need to really improve on it ah then you have higher chance to to be apa to be offered lah by the company
jangan kena pijak ah gitu
tapi like looking into like contract or apa
uh full time ke part time
tapi kalau full time pun there's a lot of expectation kan macam
tapi N level start sama time eh dengan O level
tapi ah the
ya tapi the condition sekarang condition sekarang macam mana dia punya COVID dia orang ambil O level december apa this COVID kat
but dia orang ambil same timing dia orang ada own shift ke apa atau it's just one time
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically ah system engineer lah you are looking to that position atau you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of dia punya ni lah
software engineer ke if
macam mana nak spell F O R T L A N
apa skills ah like
for example apa eh okay name like
I think it's like flutter dia ada own language which which covered dart eh dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is apa go golang eh golang
like owned by google ah so they they have their own language they make their own ni designed by them
yang tengah ah siapa yang tekan biasanya the manager kan the apa uh the business punya side the project manager dia orang akan tekan kan this apa
but each country like they have their own server ke atau they have their own
means like singapore have one server so lain negeri ada their own server ke
atau combine macam asia
abeh sekarang like ah
you know macam COVID pun is getting better kan singapore
malaysia pun like they they do open the border kan to singapore kan macam only for those yang business
ah green lane semua
so for the purpose of those yang ada rumah kat sana kan dia orang boleh ya for us I think we can't ah sebab we are going there basically nak apa
nak cuti kan
actually boleh balik ah because technically she is ni kan she is not singaporean kan
actually I'm not sure like our cousin yang always uh who are staying there kan who are staying there syakilah iman do they dia orang boleh datang sini ke
unless dia orang ada they ada kerja dekat sini lah dia orang ada kerja kan atau rumah kat sini kan
the malaysia people ah the ah all our saudara kat sana
oh cik rozi lama tak call eh
alhamdulilah dah makan dah I think
mum cook apa kari ayam so we just ate tu lah we just ate the
kuah apa kari ah kuah kari and I just cook telur sikit then makan
tapi tu lah
ah that one the smell nanti apa
iya lah bau dia kan nanti tu kan nanti iya lah tutup tingkap
but I know ah I know how to cook macam like simple simple ah like usually I cook thai food ah sweet and sour fish
and kai lan ikan masin
baby kai lan ikan masin so macam setakat ikut ni ah ikut youtube and
ya kadang-kadang beli kat ni fairprice
giant so just beli apa
barang-barang semua dekat ni ah barang-barang kat giant and fairprice
kalau ada takde ah just find a replacement ah macam
that time takde ikan apa eh ikan tenggiri ke apa eh
so uh I replaced it with ikan apa nama dia
tak tahu ah nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin ah macam ketul-ketul macam cube ikan cube
simple lah dia punya masak it's not that hard ah just ikut dia punya youtube punya tutorial
ah boneless and dia macam I think it's dried ah dried food dried fish
ya macam you you macam very dried lah dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat
ya so macam like it's in terms in the form of cube ah cube then with that cube just ah letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu
once the the fish dah tu kan
dah lembut ah baru tu lah pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak baby kai lan
letak kicap oyster sauce so once dah
dah panaskan I think like
five to ten minutes dah siap
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome ah kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa make sure letak dengan tepung ah tapi dia punya sauce senang nak buat ah sweet and sour sauce
tapi tu lah I think this is like the starting point ah cuma macam nak I think I took me awhile ah like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring macam you need to macam
potong ni lah
ya true ah barang-barang dah siap if someone already did that for me kan senang ah I think my life will be easier
cuma itulah you need
tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada agreement dia is just one house kan the maid
the agreement biasanya one maid macam
jaga one house kan
iya lah iya lah of course
ah iya lah
pause jap eh pause jap
but if the maid macam they have their own tu kan kerja timing dia kan
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day kan except malam ah kan
dah berumur ya
mmhmm betul
ada lah dekat fairprice fairprice fairprice punya online
ada lah sometimes I think
that time I saw like macam halal punya daging kan
ya really ni lah dia punya which section eh the section yang ada frozen food
actually I saw this youtube video ah very interesting dia macam punya shopping
tapi I don't think singapore ada ah dia macam like I think in america ke apa ah which country atau china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop kan there'll be someone who welcome you pastu ah you using the lah I think it's a like the device ah you need to buy the device device
if if memang ya stock finish of course the thing is empty lah dia punya ni ah
tapi it's very hard ah like I mean the software wise like
iya lah iya lah
of course ah dia punya price mahalnya it's like you're playing four punya punya tu kan console
but I think can be solved ah like technology wise macam they keep changing kan most like it's probably ah I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change ah macam in terms of like the new normal
like dulu takde kan I think previously my company my former company dia pernah offer ah work from anywhere so one year macam they give like seven days ah
kat rumah lah you can can stay at home or go overseas apa
ah ya lah as long as you do something lah usually the manager will ni lah the
you need to be apa
ah ya lah my company former company use zoom for ni lah
macam container ah nak letak something container like small one ah ya but I think ah
tak tahu ah hari tu my friend tanya nak pergi ikea ke tak dia ajak
ya they they limit ni lah the number of ah customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure berapa ah
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those yang one person kan they will sit at the seat of four kan nanti macam they don't apa utilise the space ah they don't make use of the space
then end up macam the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time lah kalau weekend kan in tampines kan
ya the queue selalu panjang
nak control eh ya ya
ya betul
oh iya lah iya lah
ya I think it's a bit tu lah a bit
it's a bit scary ah kalau if
ada orang break the rule apa kan
like actually you say you heard places yang some
apa dia orang kena ni kan kena warning kan because of this thing kan
like the customer tak ikut ni
ya lah you see like in at apa shopping mall like it's those crowded kan nowadays macam susah nak control ah
ya I think they will just monitor lah this apa maybe there's someone
watching the ke apa kan they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor yang
macam detect
check out lah don't check out lah ya it's very difficult to ni
about I think regarding the the battery lah dia cepat habis ah
like the the nearby devices kan siapa yang
um google and apple kan to ni with the android dengan phone
or you still stick with ni
I think this is still depends cause google home kan they detect ni kan the surrounding kan
as long as jauh ah microphone dengan I mean dia punya google home kan ada microphone kan
I'm not too sure ah like like what will be the reply like ah macam default like
ya maybe ah maybe ya ya the default punya default
oh iya lah iya lah ada offline data lah persistent storage ah
maybe you can try like alexa ke
tapi but then it just think of us like their lagipun singapore is moving into smart nation kan so at certain points at certain ah zone for example I think punggol ke sengkang eh
like punggol kan there's there's a lot of flat kan so I think these flats dia orang ada their own smart punya apa devices ah macam ah smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart lah basically so bila macam masuk bilik
for example smart light you enter a room kan nanti dia macam the intensity akan increase ah
as we walk into macam tu example jer lah
so tak payah tekan butang ke apa
I think they have ah macam
ya macam ada sensor kan
ah iya lah iya lah
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country kan dia kat india eh
ya there's some country use that ah macam pedal ke apa
I think in singapore ada some building kan dia macam like if inside the lift takde button
only kat luar jer
no I think I think she like macam because her life
got so susah kan so she want like
she tak nak tengok dia punya husband and new wife hidup senang
ya so I think that's what she wanted lah so that the husband hidup susah juga macam tak fair kalau
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her tapi cause that's what she's not getting from the husband what
who the siapa
dia berapa episode ah sixteen eh
but other than that I think macam the korean punya broadcasting stations all like their um
ah no sebab kan
so I hardly ever like really habis kan any drama
I actually for my migraine lah cause my ubat migraine finish already
skin condition if it's like macam he can lah
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then dia cakap can ah but
he will prescribe topical or oral punya ubat like they don't do aesthetic services ah
then I say okay I understand then lepas tu dia cakap but if you want I can try to give you like
macam the first three months I give you this ubat
because he said is not ah because I I I did ask him is my macam I feel like my face is so macam rabak ah then dia cakap
oh err it's not like macam really a severe case so I can still macam prescribe prescribe
ubat for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the kecil-kecil punya biji
ya lah like macam there's no head on top right
like I don't macam I don't see myself spending
but yours is not like macam yours is just macam white heads kind of
ah you just get from Cosrx kat Watsons ada
maybe that's because like macam depends on the product lah
haven't yet macam usually my cystic acne right other than this lah
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone gitu jer
like macam after you get you've after you give birth like macam
and then apa bekam kan muka ada mini cups LOL what the heck
even even in even on weekends right macam rare gila
I think aini macam semua turun-menurun because ayah dulu pun ada pe macam gini
you see ayah face lah or all the macam wak mak long also have like
like the bekas-bekas
I regret one thing I regret right macam in my life
my poly first year seventeen when I gatal-gatal you know bila
ya lah then because you remember you gave me the Kat Von D foundation dulu
you use the macam the high the heavy duty punya Kat Von D dulu then
no lah I'm just saying then I didn't know what macam I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation what so I just use that every time so macam I think that
but it's so it's not accessible nak beli
ya so kirakan macam
kalau pakai makeup lebih
muka muka lagi rabak even though like macam I do the proper cleansing ah
ya because like macam I don't put anything on my face what and I do macam regular
punya skincare
pakai plaster
I know I mean it's the wrong timing for my pimple sticker to habis but don't know ah see how lah later
ya kebaya
boots no I never buy I never buy I only buy like strappies and the tu
apa senang lah kalau nak pergi kerja
two bikes what then I thought like macam he thought when I get my license then I just
use that lah rather than to leave that bike all the time kat car park jer tak buat apa-apa
the high maintenance mean kalau buat delivery is very macam will cepat rosak and cepat
masalah so naz will spend more if he use that bike to do delivery
bapa dia orang kecil bapa dia orang that time datang sembang dengan ayah I thought bapa dia gini ayah ayah like lagi tinggi jer
habis ayah habis ayah gini ayah bend down nak salam satu match up
or where mana lagi ada tu

then dia orang dua macam kawan but then when when we ask them
ya but very kasihan you know cause recently
the boy baru kena diagnosed mild dyslexia
damn kasihan then
then the mum macam is additional stress lebih-lebih lagi the guy because the this guy this boyfriend kan
macam very different from the rest punya ah you know haikel your junior secondary school junior haikel azni
remember the very macam self-obsessed guy
kakak dia baru eh adik dia ke kakak dia baru kahwin
he is the ex boyfriend then then that this haikel also macam very uh
like I mean I mean if you date the kakak you already know the kakak got anak right I mean technically
tapi dah bersih ah sekarang
he damn putih
ya so very self-obsessed dia ambil macam rambut dia kan tak pernah tak ada pomade or whatever tau tak pernah set tak set
ya they dated for like macam a few years or what then he left because apparently the mum tak suka the kakak
haikel punya mum
assume it's because ada anak kot
ya but but the mum macam rabak gila the mum tak uh kasi salam pun dia tak pandang pun
ya exactly habis kalau dia orang uh macam dekat luar rumah ke apa kan

mak dengan mata air obviously mak what so left her then the second boyfriend
also left her because cakap masih nak enjoy life masih nak party life this is like macam
have their own kecantikan
but she damn kasihan I feel like whole like is very kasihan because like
do you know do you know about the anak dia punya bapa
the anak punya bapa passed away when the aryan was two years old
bike accident dekat you know belakang marsiling itu

so the road dulu kan senyap gila so macam accident
ah basil bawah lagi apa dia punya yang atas punya yang directly behind stadium nobody knows
dia orang dua motor dia kawan tau
so dia got tumpang satu then another bike is in front
so the one in front dah memang kat depan okay ah tiba-tiba kat belakang tak ada kereta tak apa crash
so it's either dia tersendiri self skid or what ah pillion dia okay
pillion dia tak buka mulut only buka mulut to lawyer
because some of them cakap oh this one uh macam some of the friends cakap ah okay the pillion nama is fir tau
so fir cakap ah dia orang cakap ini confirm confirm fir yang bawah kirakan fir cap merah you know the bike so that's why dia tak nak buka mulut dia buka mulut kat lawyer jer
but then if if it's true ah that's just fucked up ah macam kau bawa cap merah habis kawan kau meninggal sial
like then he she he never tell he when ah aqilah asked right dia just cakap oh dia tak ingat apa-apa
baru passed
ya the arwah
then she like she ceritakan me ah the whole like the macam
cakap nak tidur habis tiba-tiba like one hour later dapat call from the friend
the friend cakap err apa like mirza dah tak ada
then dia macam huh
she's twenty six so ya she gave birth at sixteen habis she still wanted to finish
but then oh when she macam bila mak dia bawa pergi doctor to check that she's pregnant or not she's eight months pregnant
so kirakan the whole time right dia just tak buat apa-apa ya then
ah dia cakap ah because like she suspected that she was pregnant habis lepas tu the
so paling paling pun nampak macam buncit
macam banyak makan gitu then apa the dia kata the
ah arwah bawa dia pergi

then now my eyes pedih because of that nevermind I'm used to it
macam when I was at gold coast right
then I just macam even though I was alone
but macam to go to the shopping or outlets all right macam kena naik tram then I will go alone
no I I didn't like macam I didn't do that but
I think some of my ex colleagues did that but dekat
colour lain colour
some of them or even yang lagi gila right I've seen right those yang pergi athens flight

eh terkeluar eh babi
no lah later if my eye berair all
ya can make your bulu ketiak straight also
sterilise ah kononnya
you know malaysians have this malaysians have like some cream treatment like macam they inject shit into their face
so macam a bit hypocrite
I baru makan tiga hari
masih ada it's still selling at baraqah
but I don't feel like macam I just wanted to try this first
ya Odella made me lose weight because I shit a lot I shit sampai air watery
my err itu ah immune
oh you didn't drop out ayah quit
ayah called ayah told me after tu
abang kita kena buat recording untuk survey ni kan
oh okay okay can can boleh boleh
um kena berbual pasal apa though like what we
ya I mean movie also boleh and
say that time err me and abang afal pergi tengok movie dekat cinema movie apa
ah your eyes tell dia punya movie is pasal is a ah japanese movie lah so kita dia punya cerita sedih gila
I don't know I was just like tengah nangis-nangis rabak lah but then the cerita is about like satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta temporarily
ya like tak buta mata lah because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like lepas tu like
macam dekat part of the story was like the guy that dia suka or like macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta kan
it's actually it was was one of the reason why dia buta
ya ah because of like when he got when she got into an accident the lelaki tu macam buat benda yang like
tak tak supposed to buat lah because you know you know
ah then after that like it lead her to macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu
then yang paling sedih part is actually like bila
err perempuan tu kena undergo surgery kan pasal boleh actually boleh like rawat lah like boleh get better so that guy pasal that guy macam very poor tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam you know
kerja cara wrestling semua so kerja untuk like because they macam ah couple what
so like that guy macam ah dia
kerja sampai dapat duit untuk undergo for that girl to undergo surgery ah
then after and then after that bila like uh
ya so because of that rant dia bagi like duit to undergo surgery then when the surgery tu was successful
dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu lah because he doesn't want to like
and after that yang part sedih was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
dia macam contact later like contemplating whether he should jumpa perempuan tu balik or like
tinggalkan so bila part like
bila part dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena stabbed
from like this like bad people because dia dulu kerja memang jahat
then after that dia kena coma for two years ah
lelaki tu kena coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital macam orang jaga then that girl was one of the volunteer
you know the thing is like bila coma so he cannot talk what
ah that's japanese punya movie lah but then bila like sekarang hospital tu then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then perempuan tu macam
apa ni like
then like he alleged actually before that he also macam buat sculpture
ceramic so he before that macam when dia buta he she felt the lelaki muka ah
so and then after that uh I think macam there was one this music box yang reminded of both of them
one of the pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang there's this guy who came in the
crying while listening to music box terus dia tahu ah that was like the last part terus dia tahu yang
apa it was the guy that
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy kata um you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad ah sedih gila and after that ya me and abang was like tengah teared out already then the whole cinema tengah nangis gila kelakar gila seh
no I mean like if I explain all obviously like it doesn't really make sense lah but then if you tengok the trailer is already so sad ya that's like the the movie yang like made me cry so bad
in a cinema like never in my life I cry so bad but I cried so bad there then even my abang was like are you crazy
kat netflix kan
how many seasons ada though
eh banyak
wah it's like macam the
dia pada like when he was like a'ah
dia semua ingat dia orang macam like weird
who are this semua nak
kahwin semua and like a lot of people look down on him lah
oh ah betul betul
serious ah ah so like betul betul just like awkward lah
ah tak boleh just
just like kahwin terus lah dia dia straight
but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like mat salleh
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and kakak and abang also like watch everyday like at the
eh but then like thankfully like ibu and bapa is like
that time I came back home then lepas tu ah ibu was like um

I I beli like I bought there was like
a few only then I'm like I mean okay lah it's not that expensive so ni lah I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits dekat
dekat somerset
it's like bingsoo then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe dekat dengan

start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very mahal like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
a'ah then kau kalau also need to promote then what if like orang don't want to come so
tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap then that was the problem fit in the cafe
ah they just go there to take picture ambil gambar aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two punya ni like

in the future I don't know what I want to be I don't know what I want to like what I'm interested in and all so macam like err kadangkala also macam keliru like I know what to do so macam I guess I want to find like something that
because I feel like I I like to try like a lot of things so macam

cuma just
kenangan kenangan yang lalu ee I don't know I cringe
true especially this year raya like
uh kita tak dapat pergi jalan raya kan then kita tak dapat jumpa most of them so we really haven't seen them like one year plus gitu
oh I thought worst I was like oh my god no hal
can't ejek seh
to eat it because I really like the biscuit and between like me and my datuk like um
he always like uh cakap like
the biskut is biskut hospital lah dia tanya oh adik nak ke tak biskut hospital ini then I'm like yes please please nak like it's so good like macam like um
I will makan it with Milo or like or like minum teh gitu then I will eat the biskut together
that biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah] with my datuk so I used the biskut as the background of the painting then uh for the forefront of the painting like I put uh my sofa all like from the living room
like tribute gitu
so like I just joined it so I'm trying to start drawing again like I really rindu art lah
it's true it's like I I know a lot of people yang macam
they ada then uh like they
letak like all their energy into the
then their is like wrecked ah but then they are like very bagus in their
word of the day penat
it's very macam
asal kerja merepek seh
tapi sekarang susah lah because uh COVID ya then banyak orang
that masuk that programme jadi to have something to fall back on
legit lah compared to like having tak ada kerja langsung kan
imagine those lagi like
orang is not oh
I don't know macam cool
rasa seh tapi this is like
oh oh I know so you are saving the earth by not eating sayur because you love the earth then the earth need more sayur
my nenek love kambing man
she gonna give any excuse just to eat kambing
she can makan kambing for like
I don't know I think she can eat kambing for like
the whole month straight or something really seh we really have to macam kita kena macam hold dia back untuk
like from eating kambing it's just that bad but she got like high blood pressure all which is like bad ah
you just triggered my like primary school memories like I uh like my my last time school also they they tanam pokok Ribena then they they kasi like me macam
pegang the Ribena punya fruit
it was quite cool like but I don't know how the dia orang buat the fruit to the air gitu
macam like dia orang just
um dia punya buah dia like
like it's not even buah it's dia macam bunga gitu
tapi bunganya dia macam buah gitu eh
oh but tapi dia buat apa competition
oh dah itu jer
tapi cute seh
oh sedihnya
satu minggu jer
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like macam
singapore cuba try
jadi macam more environment friendly
I don't know dia orang buat like macam ada certain
just rich like dia orang rasa like that sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu so dia orang macam oh just bayar it gitu
so like they will still bayar it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents kan confirm orang macam lagi terasa macam like oh my god that is like duit like I should really bawa my own plastic bag or like bag in general
you know like very like feminine punya bags
apa seh I thought I want to like
kumpul duit from uh
family member ah like kita ramai ramai kumpul duit then like beli something
tapi right some of them already uh like dah beli like dah beli the present
ya then they buy like bag wallet gitu which is something that
I want to buy ah like I don't mind macam we kumpul duit then we buy like macam expensive like Coach or what you know like something a bit more pricey like more quality kan then how ah or maybe I should ask them ah but I haven't like ask them you know
dia orang kena ada bunyi gold kan like
mak cik tak trend ah
she just like gitu jer like it's usually like clothes like very cliche ah like clothes bag like wallet
actually boleh juga ah
boleh ah go jer
I think you know I think I can like kumpul then like buy
uh gelang tangan
because itu hari kan me and my sister we went to Tiffany & Co dekat jurong east
then actually kan dia punya harga pon like tak mahal mana ah like it's still like quite okay I can like kumpul duit ah or maybe like can be just like my immediate family kumpul duit then we just like buy gelang or something I think jewelry is like a good idea
ya boleh juga [ah]
jom kita bercatch up
sekolah kau macam mana ah
jadi seorang jurugambar is aku punya impian actually
tapi if I were to
like menyerah my freedom cause kan being a being a photographer is like a freelancer job
tengah cari ni tapi aku pernah ah satu kali aku um aku photographer cousin aku punya wedding actually
nasi lemak ah
okay ah kalau aku kena makan one dish for the rest of my life
aku rasa aku akan pilih makan pizza
pasal pizza tu filling pastu portion dia macam besar
okay ah not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
pastu like the most memorable meal for you leh
oof aku pun nak pergi korea sia
eh hari tu aku baru tengok movie tau keluar dekat pawagam cerita dia pasal time capsule
so macam
aku terpikir ah if right you found a time capsule ah from long ago macam ten years ago gitu what would be inside your time capsule ah
ah ah eh kau dulu art major in secondary school terlupa aku
what to do kena kerja for a living but right terpikir juga aku if manja tak payah kerja lagi for like a living what do you think we will do ah
tak akan depend on just our government kita punya government bankrupt juga
so like macam
kalau macam gitu apa macam susah apa yang kau harap macam free gitu
healthcare tu susah juga ah kalau nak jadi free
education pasal education sekarang walaupun ada subsidy mendaki tu semua kan
mahal juga pastu kita singapore kita punya education kena tinggi baru kita punya job macam bagus bagus kau tengok ah nak jadi doctor education kena overseas university ke susah juga ah
kau kau masuk uni tak
aku punya course ni macam
kena masuk uni ah kalau tak aku takleh tak ada future untuk aku so university ah under medicine gitu tapi susah juga ah pasal very competitive punya situation so if I were to join a local university ah under medicine it will be so competitive with all the kids lor
aku punya impian actually nak jadi photographer ah tapi macam
impian photographer jer macam hobby gitu
so tak nak pursue sangat under photographer pasal freelancer kan so dia punya
hmm so just extra income kalau aku tak ada apa apa ah tapi sekarang aku ni belajar under medicine so
aku punya first and foremost punya important punya course nak masuk in uni will be under medicine ataupun
kau pula kau punya course apa ah
tak ah aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah
and then kalau nak try under pharmacy pula dorang punya
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
aku tengah cari kerja ah sekarang tapi pasal
times are tough ah so I know for government pun they macam
a bit tough to find job now even though macam
so a bit lah I don't think so I can tahan lor
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan eh aku dengar that time kau kena
satu kat malaysia
the one in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia tu a bit slow ah
um that's why ah if like you want to study overseas as a melayu I think kan australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where ah the place has accommodates to what you are lah like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat itaewon situ ah ah cause I heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
so right semenjak kita kat rumah kan confirm kau tengok banyak Netflix kan confirm so macam cerita apa kau tengok kat Netflix
tak aku tengok movie eh
I a bit scaredy cat ah to watch that show but right talking about devil daughter teringat aku pula aku punya favourite show sekarang lucifer I don't know kalau kau tahu ah tapi banyak orang tengah bebual pasal cerita tu so basically dia macam ah detective punya show so they solve crimes and all that tu macam aku punya favourite genre ah ah so basically lucifer tu dia dia actually devil dia syaitan tapi tak ada orang terpikir that he's really the devil until like his face his devil face came out then like um then people started believing it ah cause they are like mere humans kan so dorang macam a bit scared of him but he's a really good detective also ah he work like hand in hand dengan the detective cop chloe it's a great show ah but it's super overrated now
no bukan part two it's like season five part one so the season five is split into two different um two different parts ah so got season five part one then got season five part two so the season five part one just recently came out then season five part two suppose to come out in like september so and so but then cause of COVID right they cannot like shoot the last few scenes last few episodes mah so in september then they resuming back lor cause the COVID
maybe can rent bike because I don't know if kat situ macam ada tempat rental bike kan macam east coast park kan ada tapi I dengar east coast park pun tutup pasal banyak orang ramai sangat orang kat situ
ah dia macam dia macam mana nak cakap ah dia macam mysterious kau tahu tak dia mysterious abeh macam kau ajak kan dia macam tak comfortable gitu dengan lelaki eh dengan perempuan so kat dalam school context okay ah but outside school context aku tak tahu ah tapi aku punya cikgu yang lagi satu kau tahu yang yang teacher tu aku nak jumpa tapi aku macam paiseh aku tak tahu nak ajak dia keluar ke tak
tu pun aku dah lama tak jumpa last aku jumpa pun february yang aku turun sekolah abeh then then hari tu aku nak wish happy teacher's day pun aku lupa
aku jumpa kau kat situ pe hari tu
aku tak ada sebab aku tengok jer aku tak ada sebab serious aku suka turun bawa pasal aku punya kan abeh aku sorang aku rasa abeh aku macam catch up ah dengan cikgu cikgu lain semua sekejap tapi other than that not much ah aku tak dapat aku ada number dorang ah tapi macam aku tak tahu kalau dorang save aku punya nombor ke tak ataupun dorang okay ke tak keluar dengan ex student tak tahu ah kau pernah nak ajak kau punya cikgu arts tak keluar
um a'ah lah dorang sekolah tapi lain lain tapi ada satu yang sama sama sekolah dengan aku um tapi dia different course ah dia masuk dulu baru dia year one sekarang aku kan year two sekarang so tu jer lah yang sama yang lain semua A-level ah
oh yang A-level punya dah quite some time ah dia tak ada dia tak ada banyak masa kan sekarang dengan A-level dia so nak jumpa dia pun susah kau pula
kau punya kawan yang best friend kau dulu kat tampines kan jauh kan
cause kan one of my friends yang A-level dia dia sekolah dekat jer ah not that far so macam to me also can also pick a place to find a day then like we just you know we just compromise a bit lor but cause we not that far right so not too bad ah cause our group of friends then got three of us so
I actually sometimes I want to see some teachers outside of school lah so like if I see them at least I can I got chance mah to say eh how you doing but because I never see them outside ah a bit sian lor then lor cannot catch up with them at all then macam susah ah gitu even during hari raya this year macam like nak gi ah apa rumah cikgu cikgu kan tak boleh pasal COVID kan so tu pun nak catch up pun susah abeh bila catch up pun macam kalau nak catch up kat luar sekolah tak tahu kalau dorang nak ke tak pasal kebanyakan cikgu kita kan lelaki
zoom raya ah it was like um I got two session ah one with my mum side one with my dad side morning we meet my mum side cause hor but our my mum side not a lot of people so it was easy to coordinate just call I three three like three families ah like mine included lor but then my dad side ah eight siblings eh difficult leh then they all very they cannot hear one another
dress up tak dress up ah pakai dress jer pastu dulu punya baju raya ah aku tahu lepas baju raya dengan buat rambut sikit sekejap jer lepas tu
a'ah bodoh aku makan semua kau tahu tak aku makan semua kuih raya aku yang aku buat aku habiskan tak ada orang nak aku makan aku gemuk during zaman raya tu
my favourite kuih raya will be no doubt kan my grandmother's pineapple tart kau tahu tak aku punya nenek punya pineapple tart special punya
abeh kau punya favourite kuih raya
you talking about the cornflakes ah the honey cornflakes ah I go to everybody's house I sebat you know I makan all of their honey cornflake until I ask them to top up
tu ah like personal experience right then like wah every confirm hor you open your cabinet finish already still confirm got few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth right
yes ma'am then you know hari raya haji also this year at least got the the the curcuit breaker the the the I don't know ah what they call it ah the rule the ruling I think
not too bad ah can visit this year for hari raya haji like like five people per family eh five five visitors per household so you eh hari raya haji you got got visit your aunty your cousin I don't know
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
I cannot tahan ah I think ah I had to celebrate my birthday during circuit breaker like my birthday was right after the circuit breaker um announcement ah so a bit sad ah then like you know uh cannot have the big celebration like last time so I celebrate with my family lor but then I celebrate with my family also cannot do much cannot eat outside mah during that period of time so all order in lor then like a bit special kind of situation lah cause first time mah celebrate at home nobody else so okay ah not too bad hor how about you what is the most difficult part bila kau during circuit breaker
ah I drink bubble tea but like cause I a bit lactose intolerant so I can drink maybe like the small one if not like my stomach a bit upset so aku punya favourite bubble tea is called HEYTEA dia cuma ada kat orchard dengan jurong so tak banyak sangat ah aku quite picky on aku punya bubble tea KOI Gong Cha tu semua okay ah tapi aku lebih suka HEYTEA it's more settling to my stomach kirakan so if I buy bubble tea I will buy kat orchard ah kat situ kalau dekat dekat dengan rumah aku Gong Cha ah tapi tu bila kakak aku belanja tapi aku sekarang dah tak suka bubble tea kau pernah try mister coconut
yang colour pink yang mana satu
oh cause I go with my friend ah then my friend helped to pilih then you know she like a bit like a bubble tea expert ah she keep all the bubble tea chart all in singapore but then like um cause I wasn't that much of a bubble tea fan before so macam aku tak tahu apa aku nak beli abeh dia tolong aku dia tolong aku um pilihkan apa bubble tea like I think I tried the kalau aku tak salah aku tried the not the pink pearl ah I tried the tapioca pearl kot oh tak aku try yang black sesame pearl tu macam tak sedap sangat
aku rasa eh HEYTEA pun macam quite expensive aku rasa depending on apa kau beli ah aku selalu beli brown sugar so HEYTEA is about macam five eighty gitu then kalau kat CHICHA San Chen kau pernah try CHICHA San Chen tak
oh tu dia punya pearl very chewy very um sedap in my opinion tapi dia punya brown sugar nya tu macam macam macam susu ah basically dorang letak susu jer so but then I like their pearl ah not bad not bad sama dengan HEYTEA tapi kan paling mahal kan is uh not too sure eh hmm maybe
maybe maybe KOI aku dah lama tak tak try KOI
aku tak suka pearl dia ah to be honest like I tried the pearl ah it's a bit I mean I cannot I cannot expect lor cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so uh I just anyhow ah but like I buy also I a bit scared to try the pearl pearl or like the normal bubble tea lor I always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo milo blended ah ice blended or something like that ah small like that lor
shiok bro shiok I tell you my favourite drink ah is horlick cause of that I I I cannot stop drinking horlicks ah I tell you is like wah out of the place eh my favourite drink now so like wah thinking about my school food ah oof now ah got halal mala also in one of the food court so not bad ah then their mala also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken ah suddenly come out ah after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces eh then we don't know where it go
then in another of our food court got like this one like food ah I think I think this other poly also have is like um Indomie wah Indomie goreng that one the best bro that one like my go to that one ah with horlicks oof me and my friend every day right every day buy that meal then you leh what's your favourite food in school
wah but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold leh like I swear I don't wear jacket right I I I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch ah somehow ah the aircon a bit leh sekali become hot but maybe because of window open ah then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
sometimes ya ah cause like we want the space to study right after school ah cause we need the school wi-fi then lor all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late ah then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend lor then they take up the space in um in the library eh then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already what they we cannot tell them uh excuse me we need the table mah so just have to tahan lor like wah leh then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor ah sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die ah ah this kids ah
but I say ah she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also I got nothing to do mah so I sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the makanan now right very different it's like post post post COVID like suddenly she add on I don't know what bunch of ingredient ah inside then all the masakan masakan lauk lauk yang dia buat kan semua macam different so macam dia ada add add extra ingredient kau tahu tak
lebih sedap ada ah tu memang ah tu standard tapi different tu different it's all macam ah how to say ah modified ah I guess
hmm oh I like soup ah so like my favourite will always be sup daging ataupun sup ayam but then sup ayam she tak buat sangat ah cause she say like a bit susah so tak tahu but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning ah she cook in the morning I sleep you know then I wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks ah I don't know if you got try before kuih keria wah that one I help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all I help her buy ah cause that's the least I can do mah then Sheng Siong also a bit a bit pity on her ah to go down buy stuff so I might as well just buy for her lor
dekat tu dekat ah jauh pun jauh cause I in the inside I the most inside the neighbourhood mah so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk ah don't want waste money don't want waste money buy ah apa sometimes take bus ah if I lazy want go home like that ah I take bus but other than that I walk ah walk faster
actually tak I go seorang
because  macam takde kawan gitu then  takde orang cam ajak but also  macam I want to like stay at home honestly cause like I really tired from like all the school work  berlambak kat like when you were studying
yay finally do you think  kita like  akan ada graduation ceremony

maybe but not so much lah because like I'm so tired of studying and the workload  banyak gila nak kena buat and  dengan  jugak
honestly I just finished my very last assignment then ya I didn't sleep that much honestly so I'm like taking a break  sekarang yeah
it was on my module quality management be ah  soalan dia anything to do with quality lah basically  macam there's something called balance scorecard that kind of thing you got learnt before ah it just  macam companies  guna like for
its quite a fun module ah do you got any module  yang kau enjoy
 tapi kau dulu pon kau cakap nak jadi pilot kan like or is that like not really

the module I mean the intern manager like yeah and the company's like it just saying that oh near this  ada students that will be working under you like that its just like it just a list lah that show that show who will be interning with me basically yeah
no no no but the thing is we are all separated into different different location so I'm gonna be alone ah which is  sedih yeah
 kau dah  carik err part time  punya kerja
no actually  aku enjoy seh
because like err  kau tau aku lah  aku memang suka duduk rumah aku memang pemalas nak keluar yeah and I feel like I can really rest cause you know sometimes when you go out you can be tiring like yeah like everyday we have to school right like even though its quite near but just lazy and but then one thing I don't like is the we have to study at home lah because its very hard to focus like I'm not gonna lie I slept during lessons before yeah
like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though lah I can still understand so okay lah but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like  aku kan  pemalu kan so dah lah  nak kena press the recording then like its very hard because you don't want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard ah through teams all
 itu ah
quite manageable  tapi macam one or two modules  susah sebab ada maths yeah  susah sikit lah hmm
but alhamdulillah ada my friend is smart so she can help me
then  kadang kadang macam
 macam err  kau tak nak macam tanya soalan bodoh gitu so like
hmm honestly I want to  kerja tapi err my parents  nak me to go to uni first
which I mean I I don't mind  tapi nak kena tengok result  dulu lah cause you know uni kan  susah sikit kan like you have to be at least three point five and  walaupon macam three point five  pon
you might not get in also because the competition is too thight you know you have to compete with faci people and all so  macam aku pon takut lah but at the same time also  aku tak tahu nak buat course  apa yeah I I have to do a lot of research on my own lah but yeah everything now is like I'm unsure I just
 pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
oh yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to  kerja kat office I think that is so  macam stressfull because you have to deal with  orang lain some  orang tak kan  macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring lah from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama  padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her lah like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this ah the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want  aku nak jadi boss
I think that will be nice but business  tak tau ah  nak buka business  apa eh
oh yeah  aku nak jual apa seh
 tapi like what kind of cafe you know this kind of you want like like like some cafe they sell like lunch kind or lunch dinner ah like rice everything right but there is also the bakery kan of cafe with the coffee cake which one you want
yeah you know  macam orang dulu dulu cakap start jer  kecik apa  sikit sikit nanti err
at the west because all the cafes right now is is at the  dekat bugis  semua jauh kita kan  tinggal kat west kan  habis cam cafe  dekat sini is so limited so we should open one at our area yeah

err I think brown sugar right like everything also have brown sugar then I see  macam orang put the pearl  dekat pancake or something  macam semua benda nak kena ada pearl  macam a bit  merepek lah
yeah I mean  aku suka bubble tea but as just a drink is okay lah but once its like in completing in food I think it's weird but I don't know I've never tried but just the idea of it  macam merepek ah yeah

hello this is recording pertama kita bersama saya wesley because this is our first recording okay I akan explain apa jer yang kita akan berbual so please bear dengan kita kita err recording ini akan berlangsung selama satu jam so every recording kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
bersama conversation partner yang I dah pilih
so err untuk conversation ini yang pertama sekali I have my own sister nama dia rismah okay
so for this recording's conversation partner err rismah akan uh introduce herself you can start now
okay that's very nice okay thank you so much for being a part of today's conversation eh ah terima kasih banyak-banyak and sekarang kita akan err bincang
jadi setiap conversation kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
atau lebih lah kita tergantung uh it depends so untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal
mango buah mangga any thoughts okay so bila dengar bila first dengar jer uh this word what comes to your mind bila dengar mango jer when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing apa jer
I happen to like mango juga so uh bila dengar mango jer kan macam woo sedap ah like
rasa macam wah
macam nak makan jer mango eh macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal mango jer macam nak makan sahaja so uh first jer kita uh bila dengar mango
actually bila first dengar jer macam rasa
I don't know if you've uh I don't I don't know if any of you dah pernah dengar ke tak but
the brand mango ni memang makcik I memang suka pakai baju mango this T shirt from this brand nama dia mango err by the way ini
tak sponsored lah eh so kita ya faham-faham jer
okay so what comes to mind bila dengar mango kita dah berbual okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay jadi err buah mango ini kalau kita berbual if we talk about the shape we are
um it's slightly bended it's bengkok sikit ke dalam kalau you tengok betul-betul
something macam apa benda ya shape dia so
mango ini memang interesting memang it's
we can somehow cut it well in a way that kita boleh makan betul tak
mm so kita boleh potong belah dua we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so dia macam kotak-kotak gitu so we can we can eat it like that atau kita boleh
kupas kulit dia and then kita boleh makan
macam gitu jer macam
apa uh we slice it we we can just slice the
and okay shape it's memang irregular tapi dia macam bentuk yang okay lah macam kan macam tak
uh selain daripada besides the shape
about one or two colours so dia ada colour yellow dia ada colour oren
and dia ada juga colour hijau so yang
okay selain hijau there's also there's also red betul tak
okay so err these four types yang paling banyak kita like the ones that we see a lot
usually the the ones that we usually see betul tak so
err yang paling sedap
I honestly tak tahu yang mana yang paling sedap because I've only tried
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so uh the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes nak cari dekat mana eh mango ini
dalam context singapore eh kita boleh cari mango ini
senang nak cari sebenarnya it's very easy to find because
dekat mana mana ada like dekat setiap penjuru singapore mesti ada mango
mana mana mesti ada lah mango
kadang ah sometimes there are like fruit sellers that just
just so that they can sell their their fruits lah gitu jadi dia orang jual buah-buah yang dia orang dah tangkap ke dia orang dah
dapat ke tak tahu dapat dari mana but dia orang jual lah
literally dekat stations and
di dekat singapore ini like we all live err somewhat we we kinda all live near an station betul tak
err besides supermarket pasar mana lagi boleh nak cari mango
err as in it's very easy to find mango lah dekat singapore ini kan pasal it's it's a common fruit
product apa jer yang kita boleh pakai kita boleh cari apa um tak tahu lah
makeup makeup mungkin ada kot eh macam yang rasa mango I I tak tahu tapi so far macam okay let's say kalau macam product kalau betul betul ada mesti ada macam uh shampoo
conditioner yang rasa mango
ah lip balm pun ada
there's a lot okay okay besides like beauty products okay tadi we we were talking about
mungkin kita boleh talk about mango tea
teh teh yang berperisa mango err mango
banyak juga tahu and it's it's err
it has calming effects uh I don't know honestly mango just makes me happy maybe not everybody feels the same towards it tapi err definitely
I bet yang those of you who are listening to this you all already feel like you all definitely want to get mangoes right now betul tak
so err apa lagi eh
dalam segi product kita tadi dah berbual pasal beauty products kita dah berbual pasal
but kita belum sentuh ini
memang dessert paling banyak have you tried any desserts yang ada mango
entah eh when okay when the colour the colour of the mango kan yellow kan
bila the first thing when you see
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is betul-betul attractive
my attention to it so bila nampak macam colour colour bingsu like she said uh she mentioned earlier bila nampak colour colour bingsu macam
ee nak ah tengok macam the first thing I see is the the
apart from that I feel like dia consistency dia memang
memang cukup eh macam it's not too watery dia chewy dia macam
just nice ah texture dia dekat dalam mulut it's
macam it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay
I mean uh we're literally just talking about mangoes for the next one hour maybe we would just you know if we can finish all of the things that we can talk about nanti kita boleh berbual pasal buah-buah lain buah-buahan lain pula kan
okay jadi dari segi product kita dah berbual pasal bingsu sebagai dessert
apa lagi eh
um maybe itu jer kot maybe that's all we have for mango products err I mean
if we're going to talk about benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan there's definitely mango as a brand itu
uh itu macam
yang quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
cuma word mango jer kot I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like macam betul-betul macam wah nampak jer macam wah
uh besides that uh kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi mango ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu
betul betul I feel like ah okay but honestly I think err
ya you can do anything you want dengan mango cause I feel that
entah eh
the it's interesting that mango is the topic untuk hari ini pasal kita actually tak
kita suka makan mango tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
mango pudding we always have mango pudding dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari mango pudding especially dekat wedding
like at your friend's house mesti ada err
because kita tak pernah I mean jarang lah ya berbual pasal mango that's what I find it interesting kalau kita berbual untuk our first recording kita berbual pasal mango pasal
entah I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
tak pernah ada kan
I really wish ada mango soda
um that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time kot
uh do you know that uh in some parts of the world dekat luar negeri some parts of the world dekat tempat lain
the fact that dekat southeast asia dekat asia tenggara kita actually the king of fruits ini
so besides that uh okay the the scientific name eh untuk ini ini buah is actually mangifera indica
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit itu macam semacam buah itu the type dia nama dia stone fruit
kan uh ada berry ada apa apa semua then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because memang if you look at it
okay so it means ah okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so dia punya biji err biji buah dia itu memang besar
okay and mango itu actually juga native dekat india
dekat india itu
uh southeast asia asia tenggara that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
how interesting is that macam
lama gila seh like what the hell
now we're born okay at this point of time I have no idea what I'm talking about but kita go on jer eh
size dengan colour dia juga tapi dia uh lain-lain
an impressive nutrition profile ini betul betul
err mango ini memang penuh dengan khasiat there's like so much nutrition value value
means that err selain kita besides kita besides
and then apa lagi eh
okay in this website yang I dah cari ini dia kata err in fact studies link
err digestive health and eyesight dan juga has a lower risk of certain cancers
okay nak tahu tak uh nutritional value dia
okay so calories sembilan puluh sembilan
one point four grams gitu lah
carbs err twenty four point seven grams habis dia punya lemak dia is zero point six grams
lagi eh okay dietary fiber two point six grams
copper wah banyak eh dia punya nutritional dia copper err twenty percent of the folate eighteen percent of the
apa itu tak pernah dengar but sure seven percent of the potassium six percent of the riboflavin
thiamine four percent of the dengan magnesium four percent of the
okay err dia dia bilang dekat sini it also contains small amounts of phosphorus panthothenic acid
selain daripada itu mango pun is very high in antioxidants okay
okay enough in the nutritional facts we are left with three minutes to talk about mango and maybe the next thirty minutes kita boleh berbual-bual pasal buah-buah buah-buah lain lah pula eh
okay experiences dengan buah mango eh
I don't know every experience I had with buah mango is quite interesting because
I always have mango bingsu dengan kawan-kawan ke dengan siapa-siapa betul tak what about you do you have any uh interesting experiences dengan buah mango
um betul I think she's right
memang I think buah mango ini senang busuk eh and dia masak cepat so
ya just just bila dah beli itu when you
uh as uh your fridge ke tapi it doesn't have to be in the fridge also lah I mean orang tiap-tiap orang it depends right oh and err talking about experience dengan mango I feel that I like to cut up mangoes macam potong-potong mango habis taruh dekat dalam freezer
woo dah keluar macam
semi frozen macam entah sedap macam ice you know
betul that's I agree strongly dengan uh whatever that she said and also oh my god I can't believe I forgot about this
exactly itu pasal okay like okay let's just talk about it I suka mango ice cream yang dia dekat yang ada macam popsicle itu
oh my god bila you take one bite dia macam
wah panas-panas makan itu sedap seh macam seriously like that's the best
betul I don't know
cara you explain macam a bit weird tapi tak apa lah eh I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize kalau topic dia macam lame sangat but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
take a break from mango topic because uh whoever that is going to listen this for one hour mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal mango betul tak so let's hear about your day what have you done today
question dia tadi satu question eh tapi dah melalut eh tak apa it's okay
okay this week actually is my first week err since err holiday that school resumes so err as per usual I had my class today tapi because you know kan sekarang tengah pandemic tengah
tengah you know like the the virus is you know masih dekat singapore masih ada cases lah kan so today we had
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I pun dah melalut tak apa it's okay
okay back to the topic err seriously I think quite sad because dah berapa bulan seh dekat rumah like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive dekat dekat sekolah like my brain my work like ah I can just think and do work
much more than I can do work at home macam macam mana eh macam susah lah buat kerja dekat rumah cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily dekat rumah so your productivity level is not as
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that dekat rumah lagi err productive lah but today is uh
nothing too extreme nothing to some macam okay okay jer lah I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive dekat rumah ke or is more productive dekat luar
betul exactly
I had sambal fish and sambal egg
then err ada this apa nama dia macam soup petola gitu
dengan bihun bihun eh ke suun
I think it's suun this dia macam bihun but it's like um
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles yang dari japan so I think that's what it is then apa lagi eh um ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today um because you know uh work's getting really really stressful jadi macam you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then err lepak lepak dah itu jer
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about apa eh apa yang best eh nak berbual okay let's talk about our favorite music
um kalau kita berbual pasal
artist okay kita berbual pasal genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very err much the same as hers um it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean macam
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song lah macam okay that song is my favourite song
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have jadi macam bila dengar jer macam oh my god my emotions semua keluar but like
let's talk about the next genre my next genre yang favourite itu let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between err western songs dengan
however macam similar dia itu macam sama tapi lain lah you you you get what I mean
dia punya upbeat dia punya instrumental semua sama tapi it's just that the language probably different kot macam that's the distinct difference
okay and then um my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's paling banyak lagu-lagu western dekat kot that is the one that's very popular
I I would say lagu um
uh dah lupa tajuk dia
ah I tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini but
it's called mevoy M E V O Y daripada eh the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice dia
apa lagi eh ah oh ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I main asal asal jer
sebarang ah apa lagi eh okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
entah banyak man I have a lot of groups that I like
then err okay I also because err this is my family is an um indonesian family so kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada indonesia juga lah so err
we would say it as pulau jawa
that's where we come from and then lagu-lagu from there is semua
variety juga eh macam they have err songs yang macam western western gitu dia orang pun ada songs macam ballad
dia ada genre genre ah koplo oh my god koplo my favourite genre
it's dia macam traditional gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat
lagi eh ya so that's my favorite music okay kalau let's say your favourite food apa what's your favourite food
I mean I'm I'm feeling it right now cause ya I mean tak boleh tak boleh avoid lah pasal kita berbual pasal makan kan so automatically as human beings kan kita first thing berbual pasal makan jer mesti fikir pasal makan betul tak
betul exactly but eh tadi you berbual pasal tenderfresh kan I tak pernah seh pergi tenderfresh is it
is it murah ke mahal ke
it's okay I mean err okay kalau macam okay err for me kan kalau makanan favourite I is
I categorize my favourite food dalam dua
categories tahu macam satu I like err
satu is comfort food dengan lagi satu is food
I okay comfort food ini kan is the the the category for comfort food ini kan is the type of food that I can eat
everyday tak jelak-jelak like
tak bosan bosan every time every time I can just I can eat that everyday literally tapi kalau macam let's say kita berbual pasal err the food that really like macam
okay so my first one my comfort food eh is bakso mi bakso I don't know if you guys know that
mungkin dekat singapore ada singapore definitely ada
tapi kalau dekat malaysia I'm not so sure dekat brunei pun I tak tahu sangat
but definitely dekat indonesia dekat singapore ada confirm
so that's my comfort food err mi bakso
I would have a lot of sambal to go with it and I also have ah pansit goreng
pangsit goreng in um english is basically just a fried wanton lah kan
I know it's like a little bit like whoa apa sia
but that's like really macam once in a while gila like when I have money that I'll get that
kalau tak no usually my friends would be the one that would bring me there treat me
I feel bad but you know it's a it's a good treat I mean kalau macam birthday jer kan macam confirm
confirm dia orang plan dekat situ situ juga pasal they know that I love the K
okay so now we talk about favorite food apa lagi eh
ya okay so let's jump into it apa eh err my favorite artist eh

and they are english language which is what I'm really fluent in then apa itu
I juga boleh eh I pun boleh berbual bahasa melayu lah macam normal cause we're singaporeans kan I'm born here

correct sponsor is one lagi satu is you need to get
like I don't know how they get their followers is it err apa ni Instagram like social media
so nak kena ada dua-dua ah
best aku tengok podcast yang itu
betul lah
ya ke
stinger apa stinger
oh intro eh like dia punya intro music ah
kita buat macam ini ah yang
stocking KOI punya
guest lagi
bagi aku sometimes your guest is the most important key juga like people want to hear our podcast because of our guests
pasal to tell you the truth right aku macam aku have always been thinking like
senang untuk kita start the topic senang untuk kita follow with each other
maybe because of the connection ah mystery and connection pada kecil kita orang dah have been together this semua berbual
so kita nak click senang so for dia tak kan ada dead space oh
in your recording bagi aku that's very important kalau kau ada dead space jer mati jer
ya juga
then aku rasakan kalau kita nak buat podcast eh
one of kita punya daily topics kita nak kena ada apa ni
minute of silence ke kan untuk kita baca obituary
senang buat profit kita kelakar tak ada benda nak berbual kan
okay mari kita baca obituary hari ini yang meninggal for example
dia sarabanan tapi dia
kan dia melayu ah
dia tak boleh masuk ni apa sal ada violation
confusion sikit ah so kita tersangkut kan dan kita one minute of silence pasal sabaranan ni
ah tu apa sal

that's why aku tak nak that's why sampai sekarang kau ajak aku aku tak nak join because aku tahu aku akan sangkut dengan fishing
might be apa ni City Gas dia orang tak alamak
aku tak boleh call kejap ah aku nak kena message ah
aku nak ada message jer cuba aku message bro
kau tanya who is this City Gas is it
kalau orang City Gas lepas ini kita terus rush sana ah settle sana so kita pergi boon keng ambil kau punya

kau pegang jer dulu phone aku
terus ah
apa dia I receive WhatsApp call this oh bukan ah ini printer ah
printer yang benson baru bagi aku tu
kau tarik kan
ah kau maintain lagi lima belas minit kau dapat power nap
tapi aku tegak tengok macam mana pasal tadi one of the criteria aku baca kau tak boleh be doing activity juga kan or is it noisy activity well I'm know
kau tengah buat ni ya kau tengah buat yoga
ke kuat ohm
tak boleh aku akan hook
aku tengok dia orang punya reel besar besar macam main boat punya kan
ikan todak kau nak kena bawa ni jer pokok pisang
what the fuck todak
aku tak tahu nak apa kau nak bawa pokok pisang jer bro senang
baik sia
betul kau dah pernah pergi kedai fishing yang dekat changi
bagus ah tu murah tak nampak macam murah jer
ah betul
lagi kau tak boleh nego depan orang ramai-ramai
but you kena susah tu dah kau tak suka pergi kedai ramai orang sangat kau nak nego susah because it is unethical for you to nego in front of other customers ah nanti ada customer pun nak orang itu dah tak swing
but really see how ah kalau satu customer jer
sometimes aku pernah try tau aku tengah nego but because of that one customer customer tu support aku bila aku nego sia
aku ada bilang kalau engkau bagi dia ini price aku pun beli
kau faham ah alah can lah this price I also buy from you what we buy two set leh kita pun jadi kawan macam gitu
makna orang tu terpaksa bagi ah for that price
lagi uh lagi eh lagi thirteen minutes
tak rasa english ah serious
aku hoping this one hour yang trial ni
lepas cantik-cantik so at least we can continue with the next one nanti
kan dia bayar dua belas
but bagi aku tengok macam mana at least from this trial kita tahu that that dua belas dollar dia pun akan aku rasa dia pun akan feedback
like lepas dia dengar kan dia pun akan feedback like bising sangat ke apa ke then we know what to do from there ah
okay lah bro kalau dapat at least the first two hours is thirty is thirty dollars ah dua belas dengan lapan belas
kau nak try message message dia tak like takde is it ada limit ke takde limit ke
takde limit shiok sia aku all the way sia aku buat ini
senang jer
aku it's just the problem that macam aku eh I know sometimes I hold myself from doing something
because aku tahu if I'm hook it might be a problem
for bicycle aku limit kan diri aku five hundred jer that time bila aku nak beli basikal but kau tengok berapa jual beli basikal
bro within that three months with that five hundred aku dapat dua road bike Cinelli and Giant aku jual beli jual beli last last aku beli specialised punya basikal
all and all aku spend about five hundred dollars
itu aku masih jaga-jaga diri aku tau bro aku kalau tak jaga let's say aku because I know for a fact yang basikal tu example eh
I really want to get a Santa Cruz I don't mind selling both bike and getting a Santa Cruz but aku talk crap nak top up sikit see when all this top up datang aku nak dah control diri aku and I know when I go fishing it will be the same shit I need I need small reel I aku need small uh set-up aku need big set-up nak pergi boat aku nak ada boat set-up
sama sama because you know I kita jenis orang K lah for example lah eh taruk ah drill stool
aku tahu yang aku boleh beli multipurpose punya kata yang screwdriver
yang ada plus minus all the top tu yang lagi dekat but we are the person who bukan macam gitu
kita need to get that specialised thing
faham ah like I I want the small one this is good for small one multipurpose for small dia tak bagus ah big dia pun okay okay and then aku nak lebih yang big punya separate small punya separate
you know because of this type of thing I'm trying to hold myself back unless kerja ya lah if like kau cakap dengan aku let's say kita punya kerja tak terganggu eh macam dulu eh timing baik gaji baik kan aku rasa dah mau join
but right now as of right now with the commitment dengan kita punya gaji affected
because from first session aku pergi dengan kau ya the first session yang kat bedok reservoir I still remember bro
picture perfect I still remember aku punya memory quite good
so aku tengok engkau pasang that hook jer I'm hook already kau faham ah like eh bestnya like it's it's
it's feel this hand work ah apa ini orang cakap
macam mana nak cakap eh
like handmade ah like kau tahu tak
kita suka use all that tools tools yang kecil kecil tu jadi aku tengok tu aku dah terikat macam sia lah aku nak belajar sia pasal barang ini kau tahu aku tak tahu cara pasang then I cannot I need to learn
then when I learn kau tahu lah I want to buy my own tools nanti nak beli Shimano punya toolbox tak pasal pasal nak beli Shimano punya sandal tak yang tak ada kena mengena tau bro dengan fishing
macam pakai itu sandal boleh dapat ikan lebih tu
that's why that that's why I know our be okay as easy as cycling you know sekarang aku punya focus jersey thor jersey semua kat rumah more than ten
sampai benda lima belas tu lah kemaruk sia ya lah that's me if I like something aku seldom ada hobby because I know that if I like something kan aku akan terikat kau tengok Tamiya very lucky engkau tak join aku Tamiya
kalau kau join aku Tamiya aku rasa sekarang kat rumah aku ada workshop Tamiya asal bro seriously
but Tamiya ada chance aku boleh ajar awal-awal aku
ah it seems like they scary wanna file share link yang Stargate tu dekat WhatsApp group dia share link tu dengan benda ni lah jadi aku pun teringat aku punya childhood aku terus share clear gambar Tamiya aku dia orang semua terperanjat ah
aku punya room kenji kan dah ni dah modify
ah dah modified japanese punya motor uh limited edition habis aku punya tayar rim aku tukar rim sport rim dia punya wheels yang ada printed colour putih sport rim sport wheels
so just for that I know I spend big dekat Tamiya but okay lah Tamiya for me how big can big me right
that's for now but aku tahu for a fact that fishing is if you wanna say fishing is not expensive it is an expensive play kalau if you are going for

first day  pergi sekolah physically
people who work as influencers selalu macam gitu like think about it singaporean pun banyak influencer pe yang like they don't really do much like you know all the pretty chinese girls on Instagram
fast paced I guess I used to play a lot of I started with um apa tu
uh I started with BlackShot then like I used to play my with friends in the computer lab when the teacher wasn't looking then we started playing BlackShot together then from then I started playing two like I got tell you before right I started playing two with my uh primary school guy friends cause we used to walk back from together then you know sama-sama right then when you get back home also we together we play like two together lah then we didn't study much but that's besides the point then uh I remember one time like he was teaching me how to
I stopped playing for a while oh no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school punya clique kan then kita used to go to his house like my friend's name is hadziq then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then dah kecil kan then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller eh the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
like he really he really suka macam game game lah macam gitu then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators uh into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
better like it's pretty good ah I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know dah biasa
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested lah then one time they ajak me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad lah I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because uh I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun apa tu uh selalunya selepas exam or selepas sekolah then kita just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then kita makan sama-sama then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together lor it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn ah it was really nice lah I like thinking about it
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design sikit-sikit
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to uh my makcik's house siapa eh
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like kalau
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered uh Stardew Valley the one that's macam uh Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
tak ah aku beli kat uh you know
ya then dia orang ada website pe so I just searched up the game there then aku cari cari cari and I think kena like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like aku faham ah like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like uh searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then uh apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook lor I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
if I send an email also maybe tak baca that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
days gone by punya era like the retro punya ah
aku order march kan then sekarang dah
like dah nak dekat november
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me lah I think they just genuinely forgot about it then uh I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then macam paiseh sikit to you know
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy sikit
january like even before my birthday seh then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good lah maknanya like they get to
abeh kalau bukan april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because set lin's brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese oh ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird set lin ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then uh if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war lah like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about lor it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought lah like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know macam sedih lah to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
malaysia tak tahu honestly tak ada ah thailand thailand dia orang macam draw lots sia I think I remember cause apa itu bam bam went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt macam hunger games seh honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then hantar letter kirakan like so
so pelik to have everyone there macam
oh yang uh grave of the fireflies
itu sedih gila sia no it's because macam it's
my uh apa itu arwah nyai uh she came from indonesia then dia naik
aku ingat dulu kan it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she naik sampan sampan kecil dari indonesia jawa like she took that sampan all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my arwah datuk was a security guard or something ya
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely macam apa eh uh mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers lah then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know lah like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then makan apa-apa jer lah cari dapat daun ke apa then ambil jer lah makan jer
ya then she but they always tried to have lauk lah like uh even back then you know
in canteens or something people selalu makan nasi taruk kicap kan but
like even back then I don't know why ah but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one kuah to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my arwah nyai didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something lah had something there to eat together then ration out lor as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a sampan kecil aku I swear I ingat I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a sampan right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like huh how she fit inside the sampan then she said oh like the same way everyone else does ah you just squeeze together then just hope for the best ah then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay lah if my arwah nyai didn't come to singapore in that sampan I would still be
jawa so
but my mum a bit merepek seh like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
uh apa eh
macam tak kena ah ah
mm okay ah four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then um there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful lah they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know ah she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you kahwin orang kaya or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
you know cause of the water and then like kasihan lah cause
I think belum eh
ya uh for I read somewhere I think on reddit uh ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer lah but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know mm politics macam confusing ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school ada yang pergi uh mana
ya international school lah so they're kaya gila lagipun we were supposed to go overseas
tiga kali seh supposed to go overseas bangkok tak jadi then malaysia tak jadi then japan pun tak jadi
I think yang paling heart pain was that we couldn't see the tokyo olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay lah memang kita boleh pergi japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then dah lah like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
aku pun I mean like I was willing to settle for kita just stay in malaysia overnight seh or like for a few nights then to pun tak boleh literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
sedih gila it wasn't even just border tutup seh border tutup then circuit breaker fuh terus my my mood just plummeted
then next year internship dengan mampus
okay dah boleh start
belum is it nice
I saw like it's like metallic right macam kotak like that the design
tak lawa sia
betul lah
yeah aku nak tunggu price turun aja and then I can buy
aku dah lama tak pergi ah so macam tak ingat and I don't remember everything there
whoa so so berapa bilik
wah tinggi juga ya I thought usually I thought usually the bigger rooms will be lower
mm tapi like I think if you get city view you get sunset view
not really aku everyday aku sekarang kerja aja bangun bangun and then I just like relax for a bit and then I go go kerja
pasal ape ah
oh ini yang ada Jihyo right
itu banyak juga ah I mean it's it's normal amount of episode but if it's boring then just drop it man
eh you know the what you do for kau kau stay sana for like three days two nights kan
you let's say you booking pukul dua right
then korang buat ape
ah oh jalan jalan eh
dengan baggage semua
that one time I main layang-layang kat kat Sengkang right biasanya Sengkang ada open space before they made construction for hospital or something then like it was so windy that day I nearly hit a kid cause the kid was so close I was my mom was like okay kau eh kak you you you make the kite fly leh cause cause apparently I can fly kite quite well lah I don't know why that time maybe because very windy then the kid I turn one round the kid was so close to hitting the kite and I was like oh oh oh I like panic sia cause the mak pun sebelah dia je then I was like alamak kalau kena mati aku
me now me aku
orh berape mahal eh
yeah so total hour setengah
oh so so thirty minutes swimming thirty minutes mandi
then you kena keluar
is it then they still allow tak de lightning warning eh
is it is it now sekarang the the design is it like moon festival or what
yeah lah I mean like I had the membership a year membership because it was like twenty dollar something right I I keep going there until like I just go there for aircon only at that point because the aircon was quite cooling right dia punya aircon kan like sejuk gila nya then I was like okay let's go in relax tengok bunga okay then then I go home
wah during during pandemic was the worst lah that I have to be stuck at home boleh gila sih kat rumah dengan enam orang oof
apa you say what you say
like we wanted to go right we wanted to like plan a hotel staycay dengan kawan sekolah but then the pandemic happened and then every place just kena abandon sia
yeah man it's not even overseas people just staycay in Singapore pun susah tapi tak pe lah I think no one had money and somemore everyone like no job also
cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then I was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me bilang err Nisha you need to work thirty three hours per week baru boleh earn ten dollar I'm like yeah that makes more sense lah
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work lapan hours a day for empat hari right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like as long s one day you get nine hours lah you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet I think at that one point Coffee Bean nak hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista lah
yeah dia sekarang she she's just a temperature screener jaga burung dekat outside jer
mm yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then I can kacau her after that
but you kau nak start sekolah soon right
yea like November ya October ah tak ingat
but then the results dah keluar eh like your whether you can get into the school
then sometimes kau pun macam malas lah nak cari lagi
yeah normal lah I mean you also not very like apa orang cakap like err what is the word ah oh main main blank like tak cerewet like that lah
are you cerewet no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
there's so many videos about it now then I I mean I played before lah aku pernah main dengan kawan poly I was like I want play seh like like I just want to play
you need you need you need minimum lima orang eh
mm can ask our secondary school punya kawan
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl I I must say my volley friend lah there's this she at first I thought she wasn't the intruder then dia datang she always follow me you know dia always next to me sebelah aku aje then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and I'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that kita kena</malay>ok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics lah
then once someone kan dia have to like discover the body
yeah then dia report body aku then dia bilang wah I found Nisha's body here here here then I'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then I'm like oh my god this this this girl this then I just keep maki on the other side because they can't hear me right then I just keep maki her like wah this this girl ah she's lying so well ah and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer I'm like ugh it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then I'm like ugh I hate I hate her I hate playing with her
then got there's also another one where I'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well I was the intruder with her then after after err intruder can like like kacau dia punya system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things lah so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand dekat machine itu lah
yeah lah cause this one you can like ada van then you can like apa ada mission juga you can see everyone instead I would mafia game kan macam kau kena tunggu the time only
then it's quite it can get quite  macam bosan lah
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently kalau kita semua main UNO semua right it was it was quite fun lah honestly
I'm hungry man I like oh you're craving for meat ah but you're not a meat person right kau tak boleh makan
kenyal-kenyal ox man
I I won't be surprised right if you dah kawin then kau beranak kan then you like beef suddenly
are kau serius ke
funny lah usually pregnancy kan macam unknown unknown cravings
I thought I thought you said kalau the ikan is pregnant and people don't like and I'm like that doesn't make sense
oh my god I want I want I recently was talking to Yin Shen about picnic then suddenly nak dia nak main layang kan because since that last year want play layang already
then I was like oh can we go picnic then then he said like okay kau nak join tak we go picnic but
what but what apa
like currently dia nye holiday bulan eh it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of September if we pergi Isnin
okay I think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can bincang
dia orang dia orang selalu dia orang uni course sama eh
no I'm saying like their course from poly to uni sama
they dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape
no lah I mean you can meet lah but if you wanna meet every week macam penat kan nak meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
I mean they were they were nice enough to tunggu tunggu kau punya reply lah
is it I mean I guess I mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly punya kawan lah like I also got bad experiences with like kawan poly semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda then I'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer what you guys nak makan yang tak halal then then kau invite aku buat apa kan
I hate it I aku tak aku tak suka eh paling benci aku when I hear that kind of phrase then I'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no wah I I had a debate with that with Chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
I'm like wah paling benci sia aku dengar apa that that phrase
I mean I don't I mean I I okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right nak nak jumpa dua orang like that I like I don't wanna really meet them anymore
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa then kena pakai bus nye card lagi bus transportation for adult fare is so much
eh kak aku tanya eh kalau naik bus kan straight okay let's say I want go to A to B then aku naik bus aja is it cheaper than changing from bus to or what
yeah cause like kalau aku naik bus satu jam eh if I take also around forty five fifty minutes kan it's around the same time tapi like which one will be cheaper
yeah but I feel like if if I was the person cause her her topic was what technology dengan benda lain kan I don't know ah Singapore technology thing then I'm like okay I think I would cater more towards the disability
tapi nak tunggu bus tengah crowded is a bit I don't want to pay extra money for this
hmm but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one dengan anjing kan
um especially nak naik nak naik ape transportation kan public transport
nak senang kan diorang nya apa diri
yeah we're so used to having five senses susah nak compare dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga lah like we always kasihankan but we never do anything right
forest fire not fighting fire api
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week ah there is a forest fire kat California or Oregon and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid diorang tak pakai otak eh it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's I think it's for few days then diorang kan kita nampak langit kan biru lawa their langit is red eh
yeah but imagine leh like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then sekarang pun macam you know I I like okay whatever people born to be lah that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever I'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
wah what if then they knew when they dia were they planning your name to be different
yeah confirm for that nine months right diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki right then suddenly perempuan keluar then they on the spot have to think of a girl name leh
over the top maksudnya apa
know yesterday aku kerja kan sorry I keep changing topic then yesterday aku kerja thought it will be crowded lah cause Thursday gonna be Friday so I thought will be crowded can you guess how much I earned for I I work at F&B lah can you guess how much I earned for the whole shift
tak sampai tiga puluh aja
none I get seven dollar per hour right then I only make sales tiga puluh dollar aja or less than that twenty seven I think
yeah I thought okay lah at at first I thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five I had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded kan tak ada time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then I quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then I just wait and wait and wait until pukul sembilan eh then I'm like should I wash the air fryer now or should I wait cause sometime last minute also got Grab then aku tunggu aje lah tunggu kan in the meantime I just make like takeaway waffle
dah tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang eh I was like okay I just close up everything ah
kan like err don't know you should be happy or not like I'll be I mean for boss profit is addicting right this one is like I feel like I'm earning more than how much I how much I get profit from the ShopBack leh tiga puluh dollar eh it's like twenty seven eh I was like oh my god this is this this is easy money
I I guess so if you like if for the previous two days if kau macam busy gila macam selalu ada ramai orang then suddenly one day you just just quiet your body kind of just like zone out
eh then nyari Kelly kerja eh
but usually Friday ramai orang ah like it can hit incentive very very easily then I like I cannot I don't want do Friday cause I I hate I hate it that is only one person then I've to clean up everything
I save the earl grey cake sedap eh
aku ingat Andrew buat pasal dia selalu masak kan kat rumah kan buat baking semua

yes okay so apa yang sulaiman Twitter macam mana nak start
okay so basically sejak dulu I've always wanted to go to the kampung nak stay the night tapi sulaiman dah ajak so tak dapat tidur overnight cuma setakat gi mancing overnight then aku ni expert pergi sana without any proper clothing
and uh the the dah jadi mangsa to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my aurat
err I went to the one that is nearer to to sulaiman's house juga lah it's it's just a
kalau jetty tu jauh jetty tu is really quite a distance this one is yang kat belakang kampung you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then kat sana kita gi cast our rods lah

tak tahu orang melayu kan
okay you need a best part err banyak petuk tapi is just yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu ah yang ikan tudung periuk
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya tapi ikan tu the story lagi best
aku dah mancing aku sengaja feel nak reel in tapi bila dah dapat eh tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil sulaiman to come and check then all of a sudden kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail kan betul-betul sangkut kat hidung
betul-betul on the nose
then the rest of the night tak ada ikan
kita jumpa dekat singapore so the the asal before kita jumpa sekeluarga
then dia datang naik grab bila dia claw grab ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa
betul-betul keluar barang one by one ada claw back trolley besar satu bakul satu err bawa langsir
nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia then actually the next day more fun keluarga dia datang the next day dia nya extended relatives lah dia datang bawa tiga
connections lah kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya family yang dia punya extended family ni memang satu orang tu driver so kalau coincidentally dia dapat arrange with the driver senang lah tak payah bayar tambang free of charge
okay so kita dah sampai kampung sulaiman get everything ready six o'clock then salin baju semua
err that's what made me worried lah tengok dia dah pakai all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then terus
initially no intention tapi bila dah nampak sulaiman keluarkan joran tu the intention came out lah
six twenty five kita gerak then from there kita jalan all the way to that spot
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually macam where you get all the air keluar masuk then bila air pasang semua macam marina barrage lah and then you get on top of the stone then sulaiman cakap wan err ni part gerek tau bila high tide kita tak boleh keluar tau
kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap go jer ah don't scared then betul-betul bila high tide eh terus sulaiman pointed at me wan tengok terus kita dah surrounded kiri kanan air pasang besar
then at first macam mula-mula tak boleh understand lah like the the depth of the air tapi bila air surut
once you see that low tide dia punya drop from the top of the dam to the bottom seram sia dua dua tingkat yes
so macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul because of that that err concrete structure bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam seh
ya so basically macam this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path yang kita kena jalan atas
then err ada from there is like a hill downwards lah so from there ada slope to err to bakau-bakau sini and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so bila air pasang
the whole valley below semua ni semua covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky lah sebab I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest eh
betul-betul macam sini tau then dia cakap man kalau get any higher how aku cakap macam tu lah wan
takde there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm kau try juga high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours err because
air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh but the coast too low then after that we were there until
pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam ya then after that pukul satu
tu apa was the highest then after that betul-betul tengok eh kita literally sia
macam tsunami betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam
tak juga okay itu best okay this part censored sikit bila nak kencing kita ada satu spot
satu spot on the whole man-made structure kita technically I will consider this macam the north eastern part of it
away from the laut tapi towards the kampung
habis tu ada lah tengah rilek terus dengar ada kat belakang what what's that noise jangan pandang belakang oh
two three times because there's nothing much to do but sulaiman what he did most was he he makan some Pringles lah
okay so sulaiman dia dia tunjuk something this one is about naz yang recommend
dia ada satu backpack ni dia jadi tempat duduk
kirakan macam backpack punya the the sponge tu dia punya padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that sulaiman just duduk jer atas
but for my end ini tempat legend aku tak ada benda then um sulaiman punya mum cakap wan err kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak
then I I I find this yang the simple basic students yang lipat yang buka tutup boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then kita testing dulu lah kat kampung tapi bila kita testing kan mesti nak kena fragile sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi the whole boat collapsed
mana oh jelutong uh uh mm pulau ketam
dapat duit I don't know dapat joke the ikan
johan eh bukan ke
ikan johan ke I've heard ikan johan before dia macam ikan duri tapi besar
itu johan is like the middle leh it feels so weird
ikan duri apa tu jahat uh huh uh huh
I thought johan tu ikan keli besar pe oh
six duris so all the yang middle medium lah no jahans
that's why ah bento I wanna say jaring
net net lah jaring lah I'm just gonna say jaring or jala ah jala alright
ni pancing malam ke pagi overnight oh
ni COVID ke no
ah cause I thought the uncle was the one who bring you all the way right baiknya express
dah bayar lebih bawa lebih weh
mm mampus mampus
is it like the normal crabs or macam ketam-ketam bakar begitu
wah flower crabs yang kat pasar selalunya fuyoh the ones you get blue or brown
if blue if I'm not wrong is male tak ada telur ya brown usually is yang female lah
scary horror yes mampus okay carry on carry on
I wan two or wan three I wan three right mampus alright
orh pulau ubin juga okay okay
eh apa ni ah
tu lah mine mine I I wear arm sleeves you can't see but it's it's poking through lah poking through
but okay in terms of azan eh because this one also the same thing happened to me that time when I go with sulaiman but the the thing is uh not the spot but basically in the kampung melayu juga when we are back at home it was betul-betul subuh time lah
then when I was outside I thought like somebody was you know playing on the radio azan or quran
but then when I go outside I literally stand in the middle semua gelap I just stand in the middle and then I faced towards malaysia lah then I can really hear surau kat sana tengah playing eh tengah playing pula eh tengah tu lah tengah prepare tengah solat subuh
then for the first time macam the whole kampung betul-betul every subuh eh I think this one has to be like every day ah everyday in pulau ubin ada jer quran playing
so there's always quran throughout the whole island boleh dengar because kampung it's from malaysia lah you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably memang isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the surau if I'm not mistaken is the masjid kampung pasir puteh
so white sands literally dekat malaysia ya then that masjid is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area pulau ketam should hear it louder than kampung melayu
and ya lah so yang okay so yang pulau ketam is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
ya kenapa seh mana ada
tadi in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
campurkan melayu sikit with the english but when I try to put in the melayu I understand that I hesitate a bit jadi terkaku lah
habis bila dah focused then err then all the sentence everywhere
jadi kita try our best to not really mix everything lah cause that's that's against what they want us to do pe
ah yes ada kisahnya all
kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang jer lah but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this one I can say lah because I think one month dah over pun
err I applied for this err safe distancing err ambassador at masjid omar salmah
so that one is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most yang kasi harapan because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum terpinga-pinga lah macam ni nak bayar ni
ya ya then for me I was err I just answer the call then cakap hi err assalamualaikum err err is this shazwan on the line
then I cakap ah yes may I know who is this dia cakap oh I am from masjid muhajirin mula-mula aku fikir aku apply masjid omar salmah asal why is it yang masjid muhajirin yang call
then I realise ah because err this thing is by right ada muhajirin but they need someone to err cover omar salmah so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then aku explain to them lah yang okay aku ni dua puluh empat tahun
she ask the question tahu ke tak yang this place is very far very ulu ada transports sendiri ke tak then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes lah
within the week so sekarang dah satu bulan
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing eh like like at least bilang lah like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the rezeki I've been waiting for ya ke tak it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
err it's not it's tak baik lah tak baik
I think I think I think that one is the worst lah okay so to talk about sakit hati this one I don't know if if kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib because it it it involves masjid juga
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the masjid
but I will say the proximity of the masjid the masjid is in the east so this masjid he surrounding dia has quite a few other masjids
yes so this is a part of singapore yang ada banyak masjid quite near each other ah if you knows what I'm talking about
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit okay it's one it's definitely tak tak famous lah which is why lagi aku fed up
the whole story is yang mula-mula I got this call from this err person from I would say the communications department lah
kan so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying um assalamualaikum shazwan err saya nik ni err
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind siapa sia ni terus cakap since when am I helping to design a poster
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like err we are urgent lah urgent can you help us in my mind cakap
aku tak cakap benda I didn't I didn't want to be on board tapi the way you say macam kesian juga ini masjid
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just mentang-mentang kasi my
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me lah my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then bila aku dah buat semua they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the asatizahs mentioned then aku fikir aku memang lah bukan orang alim
tapi who are these ustaz I don't know these ustaz what if I type the same ustaz and I put ustaz nama nama ustaz different person I wouldn't know also what
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend lah kita
aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun by right macam orang masjid lah
and he he managed to provide me yang gambar-gambar betul lah so alhamdullilah so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature lah basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the asatizah and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
yes so so that's why I say this masjidnya sebab apa
ada pula panggil fandi ahmad so I already did the design err I understand that the communications officer sebenarnya dia orang muda
so dia actually understand my style dia pun suka my style but of course kita akhirnya when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then err
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say um aku rasa ada problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
so by right even for me lah when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event kita selalu moderator dulu you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint juga I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the asatizahs together
and then I got fandi ahmad but the person who viewed this thing said err do you think it might be offensive to the asatizah that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke is that is that healthy for you to say eh aku lebih alim pe is that actually healthy sangat
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then asatizah and then fandi ahmad would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say eh if I macam tu I I put circle pun you will find somewhere to start semua mesti salah punya right
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda so the explanation is okay but I still feel ah that's it that's it so once that happens
err game lah so I I really at that time memang macam upset lah but the oh the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman cakap okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight dia pun bilang aku that timing and then after that the next day tiba-tiba the officer called me
that the pictures of asatizah are made into cartoons and then ya alah I fikir
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger ke telinga besar ke is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the asatizah drawn as a cartoon then aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat
ya so that's why in this situasi you can actually see
that orang tua is not very flexible they understand everything then
I really apologise for this thing um boleh tak
err kita delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the asatizah in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces buat cantik-cantik bring it bigger make the font smaller
semua tu means nothing lah he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
cakap we know of someone who can help us for free ah without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why bila aku dah tau dah find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was panas I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said err salam semua this is the poster that I have done
nanti tiba-tiba jer nama dah masuk dalam for benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat
ah memang so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
yang mereka masih persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to err macam tukar err pemikiran orang-orang atas lah
cakap to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature tapi kita pun nak kena tengok logic tau the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds kalau let's say you err
secondary school lah kau tengok gambar macam comic and gambar macam real mana satu yang kau macam more wah this one seems more interesting
so itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia communication in the beginning pun tak kasi tau they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then betul-betul cakap I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then terpaksa lah kita forgive
tapi when they start saying oh by the way shazwan err can you just put the original picture ah that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair juga lah if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing memang unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced ikhlas ke tak ikhlas so
that's the that's the sad part lah which is why it reminded me of the of the time yang dulu
kita ni kalau buat design ni freelance never do for free
mm itu lah
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes macam for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment cakap kalau senang senang kau buat lah sendiri what you mean so easy do yourself
itu lah that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
then okay itu lah kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati
err even for you err folks over there that is listening in that is tuning into our err podcast terima kasih
kerana sudi mendengar kita err dah tak ada cerita cerita tu ada sebenarnya everything has been a true story believe it or not
ya lah tadi sebelum ni kita pergi bubble tea we we went to the bubble tea shop we went to we went to buy so just now like the initial story on the topic of
pelik lah but you know for the benefit of your program the thing that you are trying to do kita kita sudi tolong
sudikan masa kita pada malam sabtu ni untuk err tolong ah which is interesting because in english we say friday night tapi kalau like in in malay
err malam jumaat malam jumaat is thursday so the logic eh if you you if you're curious is that sebab kita
so maghrib is when we start our day so that's why for hari raya ah if you are also curious why we don't err fast
on the last day eh sorry why we don't pray on yang malam terakhir itu is because only hari raya
ya now dah start merepek tapi tu lah kalau kita asyik berbual for forty eight minutes straight kan these things will pop up I'm pretty sure we are not the only
err people the only participants yang err bual benda-benda merepek especially towards the the later part of this err
podcast err I wanted to say project which is the thing lah but for us we gonna treat it as podcast already lah kita betul-betul tak tahu nak bual apa lah kan

that's great sorry uh I didn't hear you just now you were saying uh you buat apa sekarang
oh eh ah ah eh like why why would you participate kalau you indonesian sorry
indonesian I see uh freelance tu kat mana
like how how do you find the freelance job macam mana
oh that's that's great because um actually macam kalau I pun tengah cari-cari kerja lah sebab um recently I just quit my job because of ya ya because of some um apa kesihatan ah related to kesihatan um ethics so macam I not quit lah I taking a break so but I tak tahu I nak continue ke tak
ya so I'm I'm looking for jobs to so macam that's interesting um maybe I can like to try to look uh look for this kind of jobs too
ah ah like I I feel like I woke up everyday like macam rasa tak happy gitu seh like nak pergi kerja alamak
hmm so like uh as of now I I tak tahu if like it's not my passion or like it's not it's not my rezeki or what because I really feel like uh I used to really passionate about this tapi macam sekarang macam dah malas nak pergi then macam really tak tahu lah if I should continue or not but like now I'm taking like maybe two months break
oh okay so what like sekarang like what line you you at like uh what industry
ya but I pun macam not really um into it yet macam how how do I say it macam dulu I
baru jer baru jer because
ya I baru graduate uh last year as in actually this year lah the apa tu during the period actually suppose to have our um ceremony kan tapi tak boleh ya so I'm the unlucky batch
ya um ya so um I I got into an internship dia ajar bukan ajar lah tapi macam it's speech and drama so I um my course actually applied drama and psychology uh so macam my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they macam post me to uh this early childhood not early childhood lah tapi macam like somewhat macam budak-budak dia macam actually interested uh tapi I got confuse I think I more interested in the uh in the drama side instead of teaching budak-budak
when I was in internship oh uh so pagi kita okay uh so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so pagi uh tak ada apa-apa it's just admin job then the admin job pun macam like tak susah sangat lah I mean like it was difficult because halfway kita punya supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in uh the company because of some things happen uh then uh so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang for class kan then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just uh tolong the teacher to just hype the class nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap something funny then we're just like uh apa tu oh my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing lah macam stupid gitu tapi macam
ya it's like to encourage them to macam speak up macam do do the drama with them macam we will have like um dramas uh drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
ya so like now I tak tahu if I nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
um actually it's not like allow allow not like dia orang suka-suka nak allow but it's like um it's a bit unethical for me to work there also lah because like err I've been having macam low moods and stuff so macam kesian the budak-budak lah
hmm I honestly tak tahu seh because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so macam I I tak tahu if it's because of my um my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm um but I I came clean to my boss like I bilang dia uh whatever that's been happening in my life then she say lah macam uh I don't think you're you're capable of working now so macam I need to macam set my head straight lah uh maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel macam hundred percent here lah because like right now you're a like everywhere
and that's a big decision to make seh because like um it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then macam in the future like kalau lambat then you it's hard for you to change but now macam is the time um for us to macam explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
ah tu lah
ya unless kalau kita kerja part time yang macam um temperature taking gitu semua I mean it's it's okay lah macam good ya it's better than nothing tapi macam the thing is ah I'm just worried macam this is just macam just graduate kan so macam I think too much about stuff then um if I take that kind of job now then macam I don't have like much experience in like uh what I want to do in the future dia macam I scared macam I'm not prepared lah but this is just me overthinking lah but um if dapat dapat kerja the temperature taking pun macam bersyukur seh as of now
berapa lama the the webinar
wow that's really good because like actually um when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to macam a diploma conversion ya so but then um for now obviously cannot uh go to the school lah the tapi nanti if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so macam um I I don't know I feel like macam its a bit more demanding in a way macam and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit macam focused on like just real school
oh no uh it's not uh teaching the kids at home but err apa itu it's just like normal school macam we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning baru kita teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two um one we teach the kids at school real kids then balik then err the teacher that lecturer will teach us pula on like about kid
um honestly I feel like a bit macam I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet kan macam I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class tapi um from what I think ah macam it depends on the company you work with kalau the company macam give you a lot of uh things to do like homework macam preparing worksheets for the kids tu semua they don't have like a proper system like tak ada macam mana eh they tak ada their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so macam it's that already a a lot of workload then kita pergi sekolah we have also we also have our assignment and like test tu semua ya so it's like it's a bit macam scary kan
ya I feel I felt that way lah then macam that's why I felt really macam um I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown semua
um I think they because there's only one that just uh finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said macam is going to be difficult lah sebab um the tempat kerja even weekend sometimes the boss I think macam she didn't like intentionally do this tapi macam just to macam she will like text us during the weekends macam to tell us need to do this this this so macam um my colleague yang just finish the diploma dia cakap ah it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then macam we we also have the our stuff to do so macam she she felt like it's a bit difficult lah to go through
that so macam she she was concerned about me lah because like she she knew that uh it's going to be tough for me and especially now kan um that's not enough teacher the card the company so so macam there's a lot of macam pressure on on the new teachers macam kita not teachers lah macam supposedly I'm not supposed to teach kan so macam they try their best not to macam expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper tapi macam sometimes nak tak nak macam takkan lah nak biarkan the company to drown kan like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya macam that's why macam she say it will be early will be more tough on me lah because everything is new then nak kena belajar nak kena adapt to the changes then like uh nak kena apa belajar lagi
but then like okay so why why macam I'm stressing myself kan like I agree with you macam since since secondary school I already told myself macam kalau tak happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then um but then now kan macam I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone lah tapi macam I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then macam I takut because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre tapi kat singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this nak buat theatre macam mana kan like there's no audience but I know there's some like macam virtual and stuff but then macam virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously err you it's easier for you to um
uh to stay there lah macam to continue from where you are tapi macam kalau you are not in the theatre company then macam susah nak dapat nak ada audition pun tak ada
early childhood um the thing is like for early childhood kan macam I tak ada um much experience other than my internship internship ya so err I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like um there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is err is err the company itself yang I am in right now is actually macam they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that um she tak ini ah tak expect us to stay very long she just uh provide a platform for a like a stepping stone gitu so macam she she encourages people to ya she macam looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing macam I know deep down that I am interested in theatre lah to I want to macam act again and stuff tapi macam I know in singapore tak boleh kan so much that's the pressure lah ya I want to do theatre tapi macam I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
uh for like kalau I nak buat early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then macam and early childhood is not bad the the pay kan especially in singapore because they need people but then like um and like if I don't continue for early childhood I macam I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit lah honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like macam average lah tapi jap eh my mum my mum is like texting me
that's that's sweet because like my mom dia macam passive aggressive tak tahu nak cakap macam mana it's like ya she macam I um because dari kecil we don't really macam um not very affectionate we are macam okay ya so macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia a bit awkward macam nak open up pun a bit awkward
then macam every time macam dari kecil I nangis about like oh my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so macam like she taught me to be tough lah macam like err emotions she put away emotions tu so macam sekarang I sedih I marah or like anything lah then I cannot like go to her to talk about things lah then macam I try my best walaupun dia macam push or try to avoid the emotion kan I will just like
try my best to explain to her lah macam what I'm feeling this way because this this this tapi then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I cakap face to face she will macam like um suddenly become very cold then macam don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things macam err err if you cannot do it then I cannot force you macam that kind of stuff you know so macam I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not macam put any pressure on me but macam that itself already made me err pressurize ya
huh err err I I have seniors but then macam I don't really talk to them macam I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there macam I don't want to stop ya
ya so macam I go for the safest uh option first which is the early childhood lah then macam but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it tapi macam kalau I nak go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then macam
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off lah I would I would say so macam if like I don't have any this is just me lah err if I don't have any macam um any education or like any specific job in mind I scared macam like not good enough you know this is kan
ya so um ya lah so macam uh as of now he keep on saying macam don't worry don't worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like um that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
mm mm ya so like sekarang I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing lah because um it was a hard decision for me to make to like uh stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company um not preparing any anything for them macam macam very abruptly lah the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague yang ah the one that just went through the conversion she macam very quite helpful lah she macam keep on saying oh it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat err ya we teaching the we we you macam assisting the same class
hmm hmm but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting um the the same level kan so macam I was err more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so macam uh craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare tu semua kan
then like um the the thing is they they have this thing in the company macam kalau craft teacher dengan language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that err idea so macam most of the time I was doing the craft then macam balik pun I buat craft weekends pun I buat craft so macam like it was really a lot of stress for me lah ya then err macam I macam I that point of time geram dengan dia lah macam uh dia keep on saying macam oh I'll do it I'll do it tapi end up tak buat so I macam pressured lah because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson kan macam the one
ya so macam it was really really irritating then sampai like um the colleagues uh ah my other colleagues we very small company lah so macam they they saw me struggling gitu macam everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then err I my contract pula my timing ends at one thirty ah but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty gitu tapi my my timing kan I'm always there until four until three so macam
no no that's that's the thing so the company macam we already say in the contract so macam it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so macam ya that sucks lah that's macam that's why I feel like macam kalau I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm rabak
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so um if you have a diploma already but then you want to to macam decided to go for early childhood industry kan so you can apply at an at and then err and will consider ah macam but most of the time they will they will accept you ah because macam tak banyak in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya tak I don't think is lah because like um it this is there's a stereotype of like err early childhood teachers gets a lot of because um there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that tak banyak in singapore nak buat
then um if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say lah the company wants to sponsor you then um they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so macam diploma tu semua macam uh your O level english tu semua and then err they will contact you lah eh but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and um october
uh I right now I don't know if I want to continue lah because like after talking to you then macam like really make me realize macam ya I should just macam do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
um that's that's good but then like um that's I used to have savings um before before joining the company kan and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop rosak so I decided to buy a new laptop lah so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then macam the laptop won't be so much lah and I also look for a cheap laptop not like macam one thousand plus gitu ah
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then um after I got the laptop so macam my savings to terjejas like affected already then then like err when I join the company then I got the pay already right then macam okay lah my first pay so macam I belanja my my family to eat tu semua then like my boyfriend leaving so macam I help him with um err not help him macam like I give him as a gift to semua macam barang-barang for but not everything lah within just a few then macam I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like um broke macam mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like um I I didn't expect things to happen then macam my savings pun now like terjejas my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then macam I really feel macam everything is just
it's just cubaan now lah
ya but like I like mention ah I tak tahu if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my err my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
um so but a bit too macam you know so that people don't just terminate contracts suka hati ya so but I I brought it up to her lah about my situation tu semua but she quite understanding she say macam the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality lah it's not really macam to force to force you to pay or what
so macam she just macam let err let me uh apa tu not pay it eh not pay her and just macam take a break first but like err she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her lah but then macam as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her lah because really make
err I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time macam I feel the guilt lah because I told her that I want to continue working but like um I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that lah honestly because like at that point of time I really you macam have a lot in mind so macam I tell her stuff that I macam regret now
I I don't know why I as of now I really macam feel like everything is err falling apart lah because um ya lah because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then um my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just tapi macam I had a past of like my err my father's death so macam it kind of like triggered me lah just macam ya that's what I'm thinking so like um he him leaving my changes trigger everything lah so err I'm feeling like really really macam at my lowest right now lah ya so macam I feel sekarang
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why macam I'm supposed to take a break during tapi macam my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working macam why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then macam I need to macam ya so macam I don't know I'm really lost right now lah so I'm trying my best to macam look for freelance work from home kind of thing
and segan kind also ya understood
okay is it is it the connection the the wifi but I think my wifi ada something wrong gitu cause macam I can but then macam like very dubbing
then ya lah I I I understand why what you mean by macam um you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really I'm shy because I mean I'm in I'm from drama so I'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is um I overthink a lot lah so macam when people macam just hesitant to say something then I will straightaway think oh I'm asking too much and like I'm troubling her or him macam I will start to to question myself lah macam like am I am I like menyusahkan or not that kind of things that's why like I don't really wanna talk not because like um I ya lah sombong or what but ya I I think it's it will be great talking to someone err especially like someone that I don't know so macam I don't really have macam anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then macam ya
ya I I think it will help definitely sikit ke banyak still help thank you so much but I just want I just want to say that I I'm really like amazed at how macam you're doing it for your own good it's like you you boleh make that decision you know of like um taking a break and like exploring new things like I I don't know if I were ever have the courage to do that
so it's like I I'm glad like even if or even that I just graduated I masih macam like in the past as they have this macam um want to like put uh put some into my savings so like now macam even though it's very little but I still them don't feel like I totally broke you know ya
so macam oh but oh my god can I just rant I mean like we just met but but I just macam nak lepaskan anger gitu because like I'm so annoyed because err so this month punya pay right I didn't know that my because like in the contract it says that I I can get a few few days seven days so macam every time this month it's just very unlucky for me lah I got food poisoning lah I got like macam selesema lah because there has been like cold uh cold bug around the school so err then I got it also then I also macam ada panic attack in one of the night because I ingat I injured my neck so macam this month I took a lot of thinking that macam you can like I can claim from their lah then rupanya they cut cut it off from my from my gaji then because like err I still macam baru kerja situ it's still not three months yet something like that lah so macam they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like I I heard macam from my I'm not I don't know lah I I know I heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so macam and that's why I thought macam um we I already macam can claim the or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day baru like I she mentioned ah about macam oh I took too much too many in one month like if I'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so macam uh
ya but like at that point of time I already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so macam macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu kan
err ya lah doesn't tapi sekarang macam I just feel a lot of guilt err towards the company so macam I tak tahu if I want to bring it up or not ah because err then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then macam they cutting from my gaji kan so macam I already had in mind okay my gaji month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I uh apa tu when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they rupanya they will like macam will not get a refund if I apa tu err discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred gitu so macam my gaji dah kurang then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay kan obviously the company won't ask won't macam want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then macam aduh sedih gila seh
like like I said lah that's why macam I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life um because like money wise then macam like um my boyfriend left for rasa macam got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really lah what's the everything is just falling apart
I have kakak but then like she she move out already because she nikah
hmm two actually but um my I'm not close to my eldest one because uh she we lain mak
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like um that won't bring that I won't bring it back home macam buat kerja kat situ then balik tak buat apa-apa
macam kalau penat penat kat kerja jer
I mean other than like there's um part time like macam F&B gitu lah guess can can do that tapi macam I don't know I kind of I'm not um I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think macam I can uh I can stay in can do that kind of part time but macam if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
organization so they are actually under macam they are more they work more with community instead of err kan kalau like you are the patient kan ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee lah macam like you just macam go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then um macam they will tell you lah or you you might need macam counselling or what then macam they will refer you to them lah me err I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy ah I'm not so sure about that but then macam um because yesterday when they told me about the the err what I can do next then macam rate of like err what the next thing then we just counselling lah macam is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
err I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't macam mana eh don't really ah take you no cannot ya
honestly my holiday was like ah bangun pukul enam pagi

it's too malam and I'm not going to walk all by myself
and now cerita juga
dari dari dari cerita pasal korea dari cerita hantu dari cerita dah sudah malam jumaat okay
tak nak ah
oo actually that's damn long eh I can't imagine like penat eh confirm
ah ada tempat duduk tak
before COVID oh my god it was a mess eh berapa banyak orang inside the bus
macam macam mana nak cakap eh like
susah nak breathe right yeah that's why I don't like wearing the mask you know it's really so hard
like satu tahun that is so long you know
yeah itu pasal ah nak buat apa right it's so sad seh like the amount of opportunities that we missed this year
kita tak tahu seh whether next year you can go or not
same oh my god last time I always go to makan sushi and the paling best right is like when malam malam kita go driving then we go and eat Ramly burger
but his burgers sedap gila oh my god actually like the authentic malaysian experience and I love it but like now
kasihan seh like
habis sekarang sebab COVID then they cannot do all these businesses you know like how they used to do and it's like so sad
huh tak best seh
dress up as a pocong to scare them
actually that's quite kelakar sia like honestly can you imagine malam malam tengah drive
habis tiba tiba nampak pocong scary wei I also will turn around seh LOL
yeah honestly but when in singapore tak ada apa apa jadi punya
like it's like okay kalau keluar terus kena ah arrested
habis like dia orang semua like they have fun with it ah but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so penat
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress gila tahu honestly
it's like you would think that kalau belajar online lagi senang kan but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but luckily for me tak it's like
our exam dulu kat um like hall besar besar kan sekarang it's all just in class
then honestly to me like tak ada vibes ah like there's no
and like honestly susah gila nak focus because like
ah tak my exam is all written
next sem we're going to have macam coding classes but this sem so far tak ada ah most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
eh but I thought they extended tak eh
best apa honestly I hated like
so it's always I feel like macam I'm the only person yang cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
oh it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I tak rasa honestly
like for me like susah gila lah to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
oh typical like mak melayu right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama honestly I don't know
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like tulis notes and stuff
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation bukan lah banyak sangat but
oh I only makan there like once before then I got try macam their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken
but like their chicken is one the best but honestly I think a lot of people say that that's their best menu item right like the rendang
oh who did you makan ah malayan council with
oh man low key nak makan seh
like honestly but like you said mahal gila like I still remember the
memang normal lah cafes in singapore all the food mahal kan tapi like
yeah I always sesat at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always sesat
more often so now I think I won't get sesat as much hopefully
I've been thinking of all these nice food to makan but guess what I can't makan cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same susah gila nak cari kerja serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
that kind of thing so like obviously semua orang apply apa kan
then bila apply then dia orang tak get back then macam tak faham seh like
I don't even know if I want to kerja at this kind of places cause honestly stress gila
like nanti ramai gila customers habis nanti got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
like dia orang macam sengaja right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
then only when you contact them then they will be like oh you have to do this nak kena buat itu lah nak kena buat ini lah
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like apa satu
then like all ten never get back to me like serious tak faham seh
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now macam COVID nineteen
time you think like senang meh cari kerja
yeah like honestly the tunggu like untuk tunggu like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part lah honestly
then like fikir fikir about it right it's like
you say a week right then any time in between that week pun you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
will end in a few months tapi tak
hais all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can keluar but like barely pun
like I buy it for what I can't even like pakai to keluar and it's like so heart breaking
have this kind of spike and all then like when it terjadi macam terperanjat you know
we were like oh it's china's problem like kita semua ingat like oh china jer apa yang ada virus ni
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia tapi tak seh
like tiba tiba ada berapa banyak cases
sekarang [dah] like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly banyak gila and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
and honestly like dia serious tak guna ah honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like tak faham seh like
I understand wearing mask is susah lah but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also what right
yeah but if you think about it macam kasihan seh orang orang kat because like in the end
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like baru to them right
then maybe they will just dengar what he say because in the end he's president what he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so kasihan
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so merepek sia you think about it it's like
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday lepas tu habis kan
ah kejap eh
so he like macam like got my attention ah then like wah he not bad sia honestly
but tak apa ah maybe this kind guy will be the exception kan
tuk tuk and like nenek will have these kind of names
super super tinggi but like one seven five not bad right
like okay lah I'm not like super upset about it ah tapi um macam sakit hati ah like because like
he just double tick me sedih tahu
I only made the account semalam so it's like what
banyak gila like malay guys who like match with me
daughters as in macam anak anak perempuan
it's like very personalized so macam you tahu macam he don't use it on other girls
I don't know the guy so far okay lah I think everyone macam
extra bosan now cause of like COVID nineteen
intense apa
like tak pernah dengar seh a dating app like this like OkCupid is so chill what it's like
habis lepas tu start talking but like Bumble is so intense what the heck
you got try before right the K Fry chicken sedap tak
ah seh honestly kita selalu pergi malaysia because like the prices are cheaper right especially with the
it's sedap gila like I don't even like dim sum
yeah like dulu kita kan selalu pergi malaysia like my family will go to like
makan like we are always eating you know
like you said there's not much to do in so it's always like makan makan makan
like kita
in one day I think we will makan at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like konon konon macam food tester ah try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best gila seh that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not halal in singapore is halal in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like kena makan pepper lunch
I think it's like I saw your story then you saw my story kita dua kat kan then you like ask me where I going then like you said oh I going there also then I remember it was so funny
habis like tengok bawah
eh is that anna habis my whole family macam
siapa ah dia boleh like terserempak in cause we are singaporeans right
best apa imagine being able to go to an Apple store and like just woo spend all your money on the stuff honestly good life
I rindu seh like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to makan nasi biryani
but yeah basically macam
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat nasi biryani then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic nasi biryani cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on nasi briyani and all tapi tak
our weddings will always have like the nicest nasi biryani and honestly I just miss all that
he always does macam poll on Instagram and then got one time he tanya which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote nasi biryani I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have nasi briyani like
when I think of wedding I think of nasi biryani right
yeah and another thing that I feel like kena ada is sambal goreng pengantin right
mm macam macam pelik also pe like hari raya is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally pe like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during puasa so tak payah makan
but like how pelik is that like puasa is like meant for
puasa you know macam
mana orang nak pergi wedding mana orang nak pergi celebrate semua macam merepek kan honestly
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it sekarang COVID
err wedding kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang jer kan
you know like honestly you know how malay families macam selalu kena ada wedding besar besar kan honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding yang besar besar because
okay you think about it you eh you're the pengantin right then like penat gila seh you must tukar outfit berapa banyak kali throughout the day
habis you kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum the whole day I don't want
macam my wedding to be full people yang my mum tahu you know cause it's my wedding pe shouldn't it be people yang I tahu not my mum
yeah I think yang paling penting is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride yang cantik yang berseri you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing lah need to see whether my husband in the future kaya tak kidding
you know macam like err ada movie this one movie I forgot what the title is ah tapi macam
dia orang best friends dari kecil then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
habis like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie ah tapi the movie best gila
since dulu I've always wanted to do like a
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal macam lagi best ah to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so bosan now
yeah like in singapore macam susah gila nak like get all these things ah honestly cause
susah eh nak dapat all of it yeah so it's like
yeah I also think about it like err my dream die do right is to belajar in Australia
but actually like if you fikir about it lah actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain bila like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also pun nak migrate but then if you think macam sayang right cause everyone is here then nanti raya macam mana raya will be
but I can't imagine now like sekarang jer [dah] susah for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
like you know dulu all my family members call me celup because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school semua orang terperanjat macam huh
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like berterabur
yeah actually it's true ah macam
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind yang want to totally forget about our language
like dulu like in malay class my cikgu always say like you want melayu to become obsolete is it
how all of you tak tahu cakap melayu semua then like I think about it like true seh like
how can a language just disappear macam sedih kan like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so I will try my best to improve my malay sekarang I don't know
yeah honestly faham ah like hari raya is very like
honestly I feel like good looks is macam
genetic ah like kalau your parents
you macam
I rasa macam
good looks bukan benda yang you boleh work for but fit body is
dia tak boleh dapat any other way
I pun nak tanya
cause err I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay kalau tak salah
because macam
I baru baru-baru ni I main apa tu
I I main kan then I noticed ah
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so macam
senang nak pergi nak nak fly back dari like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I rasa macam
kalau kita orang err
kalau manusia were to be extinct right
then I rasa
most likely way would be dari viruses macam COVID lah that kind cause we are so
you never ever really hear about them pasal
tak ada banyak orang yang pergi africa
if we tapi kalau
going to africa to like visit ke apa
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places tapi like if you also see right
africa pun dia orang punya COVID cases not very high
so kita orang tak
tak prepared lah kira
I faham I faham
tu tu okay tu kalau
kalau population turun kan
the world gets better in a sense pasal
the the one problem that we're facing now is terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup err tak cukup resources macam you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
so in a way unless like if yes our kita orang punya population turun
pasal like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct pasal there will come a point where
dah cukup like now we finally have enough
kalau you boleh err
kalau you boleh dapat tiga skill
yang err apa-apa skill lah you nak
apa skill yang mungkin you pilih
apa-apa lah
so kira like you you can you play soccer so kira maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also boleh lah
you punya
apa third one tadi
okay lah I feel like that yang yang the last one is
you you tak boleh manage stress you are done
in in my in my opinion lah like macam
because I run like competitively so I rasa macam ada orang yang
yang yang yang very
nak nak pergi dia orang suka competition macam gini and all that stuff
untuk I kan suka competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part lah
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you dah kerja dah dah dah dah train dah work very hard for it
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only macam
bukan physical jer tapi
also dari segi mental
boleh tolong ah pasal
I rasa kan
so kalau kira I tengah buat
err example lah during err exam during exam period kira kita orang stressed dari like buat maths mathematics ke apa
kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari and all that stuff ni benda yang I rasa orang lain tak faham ah
macam dia orang kira oh
main sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but dia orang tak faham yang like for people like us people yang selalu buat sports and all that
cause macam you do math then you are like wah
wah tak boleh ah tak boleh I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you will like wah then you even more stress you you feel even more like lebih teruk
jadi like
I macam
I can okay there are times when I can read situation betul betul tapi
and like most sometimes it can be bad lah like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that tapi kalau let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
you know so kira you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
so I rasa like that's one thing that I can work on lah and that's something that I should work on
apakah sesuatu yang you
you nak
apa yang you nak yang you wish that would be free
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge dari segi wang tapi juga macam you don't have to work for it
like it just comes macam gitu
okay lah then we keep it to benda physical lah like macam yang benda monetary ah monetary
free untuk
because in my opinion macam
and macam you will feel very purposeless
like macam sekarang
kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja lah tak kerja tak like training macam kita orang
dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat then like I have had
ada lah orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang feel very purposeless tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis exam kan abeh dia orang
tak payah belajar and all that stuff
okay lah you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems macam world hunger and all that stuff you know
it will help not only myself but it would help orang lain
satu hari macam in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
ya just because he's dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang
dia the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him macam different
macam he will not stop until
that he that dia dia
dia deems as
um not good lah so basically whatever he does is really untuk kebaikan orang lain that kind and he will like do anything for his family
the the the common pasal I baca comics kan the common like theme throughout semua yang semua
dia very rarely dia make mistakes
because dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul
buat ah kerja dia betul-betul make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when dia pun
apa tu dia pun makes mistake lah because he's human what so
oh carrying on with that because you know how batman selalu macam
kadang-kadang in like comic kalau you baca
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you rasa
can be good can be bad you you just say lah apa-apa lah
a label tapi macam
it is an idea yang macam
kira okay so
that that label that oh he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like apa-apa jer you know
I don't know lah I I do like you I macam plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence kira then you
you know you get what I mean kira
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are kira unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like eh how come you today like a bit slow eh how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
kira it can be good lah
given your current life kan like kerja cause kita orang baru habis err exam
tapi like if let's say like five six years from now
lepas lepas lepas uni bila dah start kerja ah
to be fair I also macam I I feel the same way as you
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say kalau
people you nak kasih dia orang apa yang you tak you tak ada
I I pun nak macam gitu tapi I rasa macam the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
so like being a coach cause sekarang like I I already sort of do that lah kadang-kadang like macam
I go back to school then like I help some of my I tolong coach I
to like err ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu lah
then I rasa macam
it will probably be pagi
they especially kalau lari kan so like morning will probably be an easy run
tengah hari probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably macam benda technical and all that stuff which I can also do lah in that sense which would be better because in a sense kalau you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that lah this is of course like you said assuming yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam err my life lah that kind
I don't know I rasa macam I punya ideal life is very training centric
kau tahu macam mana nak buat brownies

actually I don't get it is it taxes or what cause I heard is some hijrah fund or something I don't get it lah the
cause I watch one video they say it's actually like um people chipping in to go to mekah something like that some
some tabungan ah ya that's why that's why I was like wah you scam and most of it is older people that one like atuk-atuk nenek-nenek they like dying but want to go to mekah that type so they chip in to the tabung ah then I'm like bastard sia

a'ah eh no no no salah salah that was lockdown
cause even if the vaccine come already the job market is still rabak though means maybe when we twenty three baru we find a proper stable job or like twenty two
then some more they say the airline industry will only recover in twenty twenty four so we can only travel properly by twenty four years old I want to cry lah sial lama seh by that time I'm like almost thirty eh

dah lah kedekut bodoh pulak itu alamak
yay okay um oh my god can you imagine I cakap yay pula nanti dia kena transcribe lagi takpe takpe okay
oh how come ah how come boleh
but still two and a half months pass by quite cepat actually kan
oh cause macam
bila you start the project dah start is it the project that they were doing at the place
oh eh the area dekat dekat mana though
what was I going to ask oh but then macam was it susah to like
you know you you took on like new cases atau existing cases that they pass on to you gitu macam tak hard to adjust
macam short staff short staff sikit lah gitu
oh I think I remember your office dekat mana dia tempat uh my office dulu kan daerah situ
uh apa apa itu nak cakap mm
oh tapi padahal they
ya so macam your experience is good lah from the oh
and then macam environment besides environment wise macam your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all macam okay lah like okay like no issues
pasal dia dah biasa with what macam
tidak apa lah kita apa itu take turns
are there ada interns lain or you just seorang intern like or like got other people macam doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually macam fresh grads or
all macam budak masters or like budak degree macam you know same level as you
oh so it's not macam it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
ketawa but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year atau
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of macam
macam organisations lah
you know ada this issue
apa itu offer so called
it's okay keep your options open then macam explore um you know macam lain opportunities when do they need to hear by
uh okay tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam deadline for the application
ya faham faham totally faham
cause tadi bila I ketawa kan dia punya line macam besar
apa nak cakap mm
oh okay ya I totally understand macam the need to take a break I mean
studying kan lagi berapa lama before you finish the when you finish your masters
tak necessary is it
mm ah ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking macam you know I really don't mind
so macam who knows maybe if I if a a different place macam even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree lah gitu
okay is macam zoom is surprisingly so much harder than tak zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like macam you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot macam how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like um when I
and then macam the way you talk to them actually on zoom kan you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so macam the tone macam they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then macam I get a bit sub ah subconscious a bit conscious bila I punya camera on so macam when my camera itu on so I boleh nampak my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very macam self-conscious gitu lah
so tapi bila I off um I am less self-conscious I can be less
err I can be more strict gitu tapi I tend to not because kita have to senyum for the entire lesson senyum for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so macam
kalau macam camera off then I will terlupa to senyum gitu lah ya so a lot of things to take note macam
tapi dia orang macam type nonsense tau macam hi hi hi hi macam
kalau answer dia A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like ugh but then okay lah they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think tapi ah last week I did not teach because um oh so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then bila I balik
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I tak warm up lah it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just angkat berat then I felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then I was like oh no
so I thought I thought macam okay okay is it because I'm sore asal asal macam susah ini I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
be sakit lah then macam I really messed up like aiya something is wrong lah this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back tapi I continue whatever I can but lepas I balik I had a class lah and then during the class I told them I will be lambat sikit because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour macam this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so macam so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually kita will jumpa about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in lah so it's still okay
and then macam um I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my um how to say my not my supervisor lah she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday tak payah so macam you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
jadi on saturday she told me uh tak payah kerja because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
tapi I tak pergi cause my back sakit so I was like okay lah okay lah
ya tapi
ya then after that I thought okay just rest lah macam take this opportunity to rest so I rest tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik and then macam it hurts when I sneeze so I thought alamak ini macam not macam bukan tak normal kan ya
ya so I told my coach semalam yang it hurts when I sneeze so she said mm she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like oh maybe you should go sebab kalau pergi the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like tak nak so she was like okay lah then macam tengok chiro or like uh get a sports massage lah so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like bekam
and sports massage cause I read like bekam can help with like nerve macam you know what if your nerve macam err nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you macam you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so macam it's apparently bekam can help with that and macam
ya bekam can help you with that I takut sakit tak have you tried it before
oh did she say if tak sakit eh
mm you free kan dekat gambas that's where my other gym is
uh dekat sembawang there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that um has is qualified to do like the massage and the bekam is dekat will be at the gambas one on monday
err she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she belum reply I so I tak tahu belum confirm ah tapi
itu pasal she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so macam
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then macam what she will do depends on your condition so macam either I mean you can ask for her to bekam lah if you that's what you want macam mana otherwise she will uh base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a bekam or like some mobility work ah
mm tapi I think she buat bekam angin if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing bekam on instagram can send you
no it looks like the angin one like ada macam after she put the cup like she pull something mm then the thing macam suction
go for the darah one
oh so the dia macam slightly different how to say
err like bekam angin versus bekam darah macam target slightly different things lah gitu
oh the dekat rumah dia is it
oh I ada macam hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
um like consultation dia sahaja dah
macam hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
uh tapi ya she she's a private doctor lah so very mahal like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation sahaja hundred plus then macam if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage atau bekam dulu lah I mean kalau it's not like
no ah abeh sekarang sekarang my kaki sakit dah lah belakang sakit kaki sakit because I pergi gym
for training yesterday kan then uh certain things aqilah lah like macam you know she
uh macam certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know macam I feel like my ego I have like macam like it's frustrating lah
like all the progress I've made gone so macam the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because macam nak angkat sahaja sakit then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared lah so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya and then tapi semalam ada sekarang my kaki sakit because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so macam like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so macam
oh really ah tuesday I still have like um today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more sakit then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after bekam there's no like rule to not do any physical activity kan I mean kita jalan sahaja
so kalau kita I mean kita hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
oh my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti all the haha hehes that kena transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also lah can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
oh anyway apa itu so
have you seen the list uh list pula have you seen the website yang I hantar
I don't know eh macam the jinx tak lah
I mean mana-mana pun ada so it's me lah
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say dekat situ ada banyak trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
your areas ada ke other trails macritchie is it wait no sembawang area
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it apa nak cakap eh okay we can look at more sites lah think got more options tapi yang yang at the the one I sent you to mm kita ada the lower pierce reservoir park
and then there's the sungei buloh wetland reserve need ini dekat mana eh kranji hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
oh this one got stairs don't want malas they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
oh tapi is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time ingat tak yang kita pergi makan
yang kita makan mukshidonna oh ya so she was talking about that
not officially tapi like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice lah he just seems macam very shy a bit macam shy lah I mean like a group of girls then kita kan kecoh so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
ya and very macam considering he's quite young he's very macam independentish macam financially independent like ya like matured lah matured
because err I assume her house I mean her house is big kan so I think and her room is big so I think macam he moved in with her lah
and padahal and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay lah I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing tudung
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because macam how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes lah like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then macam if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean tapi macam less of an issue kalau if the guy moves into the house cause he
uh ya that's true I feel like macam there's that expectation lah double standards a bit ya
not working ya because like oh perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
especially macam your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so macam if you come back after a few years then you're like uh you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care kan then it it might fall to the parents that's not fair so macam if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where macam dah besar sikit then at least school age school going age you know
ha nampak
topic ni berat eh topic ni is very this topic is orang kata very wide dia punya spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance tapi beauty in terms of everything not just
uh look wise tapi beauty in uh nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is memang kita boleh counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
uh time kita berbual
so okay kita start gini lah eh kita start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay kau kau start dulu apa kau punya definition of beauty pada kau
oh that would tu bagus tu yes that that is bagus err bagus bagus
I don't see myself as kau tahu kan macam victoria's secret punya type punya ke lawa memang tak lah memang not even near that lah but because I I have my insecurities um based on appearance juga which itu pun is another topic eh kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu about me about
which people in our society is blinded by that sebab
standard kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
tapi for me beauty kalau kau lawa pun mana pun but if your if your attitude is macam gitu then
then memang you know what I mean
memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective ramai orang ada different punya perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just uh it's between the both of us what is our definition
oh okay for me my kawan the friends that I go like the friends that I cari atau dapat it's okay we we can talk about poly ya kita punya poly days is kita tak I I don't see like oh kau lawa I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never sebab
kau lawa I was going to say you no no no no I never sebab
I mean I don't know for me memang I don't see
go towards that sebab it's not gonna be a genuine punya relationship you know
sebab it's just gonna be
for clout macam you know you know some people uh there there is some uh cliques ke apa whatever in school yang macam okay sebab kau lawa kau popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame dia ada attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is memang maybe not because during after kalau your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person yang macam will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
macam for me and you eh macam this is kita pun semalam baru jumpa eh we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like kita punya relationship first first kita start from sec one
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and err err our friends yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward tau and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever inshaallah
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
kita punya personality because okay imagine kalau the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine kita takde macam makan orang makan orang you know what I mean like like betray or
tak payah cari beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any betul tak tu
like fashion wise you know is it oh damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
uh handsome uh lelaki kat dalam my course yang baik yang humble yang tahu yang dia orang tak stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also um
uh girls that they they dia orang punya dia orang macam you know they have that that beauty standard lah dia orang ada that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are sombong they are arrogant you know
so so macam it's a
I don't know err macam for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say kalau kau lawa you should then uh take advantage of it like you know you should your personality pun kena bagus
sebab but but people people who are lawa usually you know you know dia orang dia orang I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna ada that ego you know that ego that that it depends lah how you are brought up you know
not just that lah beauty in terms of you know right uh now we are all going to that stage of working kan it's always kalau it's always macam you see this um
not just competition but macam okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that macam sebab this person is sexy ke apa ada landed job
I mean that is for us yang mungkin macam of a lower standard
betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur eh I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
tapi uh beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that uh
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari um
is beauty important macam appearance wise or the best is macam mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
ya tu memang tu memang tu memang
ada yang suka cute cute ada yang suka macam E-boy E-boy
uh no err not not not the first uh judgement because because first judgement memang is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but uh overall macam to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
okay kau okay kau kau share kau share dulu cause ni pun uh is an interesting fact
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty sebab okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing macam okay lah first judgement yes appearance tapi kan people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or macam
uh macam the the act of uh sharing macam
uh caring the your you punya personality that is beautiful so
macam I think beauty eh is is
is again subjective sebab
ada orang eh they say macam asalkan kau kemas kan macam kau err you are clean you clean yourself macam it macam bukanlah you I'm asking you macam pergi plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
but but overall macam the of how you take care of yourself macam for the macam kita how we how we like its like macam you know like we we kita basuh muka something like that you know
the sense of beauty sebab okay macam beauty eh is again macam very it can be very um
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know uh I I got this macam macam experience kalau we we talk with our friends ke apa we always like ada juga topic topic yang macam ini maknanya macam anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of uh people
uh again it's it's about um macam low self esteem you know kau ada face gitu tak aku ada I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that macam to me I find that
macam kau do do you have any like um
insecurities ataupun macam low self esteem towards this kind of uh topic
I pun sama
sama sama sama sama for me sama err like I think
susah eh macam
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
terdetik lah kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang very kita rasa macam eh alamak you know what I mean
I I came across this one uh uh apa tu uh it's a meme lah the it's a kid the kid says macam the kid was saying uh dia like macam to god tau god uh
okay but I think betul lah macam
for me pun times yang I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful lah you know which is a wrong mindset sebab that means eh
if I'm uh pretty I will get somewhere I would get uh at least a modelling job ke apa you know at least I have something tapi
tapi okay siapa tak nak lawa kan siapa tak nak handsome buat apa dalam dunia ni
um tadi nak tanya tanya seribu question boleh
I think kan for me okay kita kita perempuan kan but I I think um generally generally speaking kan I think it's the girls is it but not me lah
subjective subjective but but I think kan it's more towards the girls sebab kan kau tahu lah macam we have like boys and girls is different what kita punya how we hangout how we
pergi towards that that
that apa tu tujuan like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
to you apa to you which one for you
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also lah you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which macam for for girls maybe some of them will talk about eh look at that I mean eh macam eh have you heard this about I heard about macam some of my friends uh classmate dia macam eh kau tengok tu eh kau tengok dia ni eh kau tengok you know they we they are always macam
that's kind of the topic yang
for you know me and you kita tak kita we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
kaum wanita lah it's always kaum wanita
tapi ya ya but uh uh um to mention macam orang yang tak lawa
tak but it's kini it's how society pandang you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know sebab this is how society looks sebab to be honest who started this thing called macam
uh okay uh kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this uh or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing mesti ada dulu maybe in history ada jer yang macam
okay kalau you macam ni I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with um you can say ni lumrah manusia tau you know kau tahu benda ni macam this human standard the world doesn't do this tau it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually kalau kalau we all treat people the equally uh got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having uh insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem sebab it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
macam okay I'm not gonna I'm not sebab you get it's subjective it depends some ada some parts of the world takde macam gini but some parts some of the world
that is very macam sebab it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning what that's why ramai orang macam ada yang every article is that people suicide you know
tak payah cakap pasal you macam gini kan it it can be because maybe sebab uh you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you what betul what macam
dia orang tak kacau kau apa or like they judge you base on your uh clothing ke based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can uh about also about also macam status
hierarchy system macam kaya and poor
is is tak berapa bagus
not just beauty tau macam pasal poor and rich pun boleh jadi problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen uh kau tahu kan macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak kan macam budak budak ada yang kena outcast kan you know what I mean
that macam uh the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that uh after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit macam betul lah like
takkan semua sama right pekerja then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work what because
true true true so memang ini
lumrah lah eh memang memang it's the world lah it's just it evolve like this lah to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be uh plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay uh dunia hiburan
about okay uh western world atau K pop eh macam for example that kind of thing
usually yang lawa jer pun yang disanjung disanjung disanjung
eh actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean punya
the K pop world you know what I mean sebab in western world we don't look at beauty what we we we judge based on uh music wise kalau kita suka kita suka macam for example like
uh there are uh idols macam mana eh
macam okay uh like
tak I think macam it's different kita tak boleh compare we cannot compare like western punya industry like the hollywood and and also K pop sebab K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol atau the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
yang lain semua you know especially when you're in a group of uh like of kau pernah kau pernah uh come across this article tak dia macam there's this one idol dia punya member tak berapa lawa tau macam
to me it's fine lah but it's ada sikit macam different daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa then all the all the macam the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is tak tak not of a pretty tapi is in the middle
so I think that is also rabak lah to be honest
ah memilih kasih padahal sama group tau padahal they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead lah like like why sanjung uh idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada jer yang news turns out that oh this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesn't uh
yes you said it betul apa
macam you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish tapi okay but see this is how beauty
beauty eh macam
uh sexiness ke based on their face ke or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards uh bad punya
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as uh the macam those those fans yang sanjung sangat kan it's not uh it's not it's not a good habit for them what sebab
sebab right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like macam harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
macam kau tak payah ada beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
tengok jer macam um oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the lawa the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that uh hosting punya and she can be successful you know what I mean
yang benda uh success
it also goes with macam top uh fashion wise you know what I mean
macam kau tahu kan dulu uh okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like uh sloppy
macam T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then kita pergi kedai mamak something like that right
kedai uh kopitiam or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think macam they they will look at us like eh dia ni biar betul you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where kita kita I'm gonna feel macam
tapi get it it's it's how era goes you know sebab zaman dulu imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right dulu time maybe like early two thousand
a dress with heels to a kopitiam people will look at you macam eh you biar betul
lain macam but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
uh think macam oh kau lawa macam it's fine
so see how this uh the the era macam how uh move eh you know what I mean
lain eh which is weird eh macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir wah
as technology becomes more macam
orang kata apa lagi gempak then
jap eh
tak tahu no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in macam those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters dia orang nak step jer macam they just follow the trend you know what I mean
I think there is like macam photos trend I guess kita kita use simpler uh simpler terms eh
as you know macam around starting to see because here I feel it
you know what I mean sekarang uh is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is uh macam instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
uh this kind of thing uh macam pinterest uh
dulu tumblr okay tiktok sekarang tiktok kan
sekarang tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's punya life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols ke your punya favourite punya artist uh kim K ke whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so maknanya
due to that that's why uh people are like following macam okay macam E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl tapi you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
tapi to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing err you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like suka dia punya style macam some people you can we see oh I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means tapi you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya macam that is that is not the right way sebab macam kau kena genuine with yourself lah macam
imagine you are not like that right tapi sebab kau nampak uh your maybe your cliques are all macam
uh going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you uh if you just change your clothing then it's fine tapi you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing kalau if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good uh circle of friends that is a good company tapi if you start to macam okay maaf cakap eh this can be very sensitive sebab imagine if your circle of friends uh macam smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right tapi you buat
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't uh people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right macam you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in macam
with people macam mana eh I I say you don't need to get okay macam mana kau nak get this thing
so macam you know like um you know they say there's a saying macam uh everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like macam macam mana eh like
err macam the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset tapi you you don't
but because everyone's macam kau
needs a level up you know what I mean macam level of for the good
tak bagus lah tapi macam like see this is how uh trend setting macam
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it tapi if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later tapi if you follow that kind of group yang buat benda tak elok then uh then you should
you should have your own pride eh macam you know what I mean kau punya pride kau tak payah follow orang lain punya orang lain punya instruction ada betul
boleh boleh boleh shoot jer shoot
pandang rendah is it pandang rendah you look down on them oh
where you stand macam mana you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead tapi kalau you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's sebab you nak ada you nak ada friends you know what I mean like quotation macam you nak ada friends punya pasal then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good uh there is not a good tujuan sebab kalau kau really nak
I mean you know some people macam for me no eh macam for me I got this thing where
kalau aku takde kawan then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
kita nampak I've I've I've seen this
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they dia keluar from the group kan dia keluar from the clique and then dia cari orang lain immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much macam you like like tak bagus lah I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own uh pendirian daripada
I I think uh I need to find I need to find a friend because uh because people might think nanti macam I got problem
same goes like your question tadi whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so sebab if the loner if that loner sometimes loner tu feels that
there's nothing wrong uh he he or she is of a good uh direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I kita support aku support tapi kalau
sebab you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on oh kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish lah I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know macam they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
sebab if you want to go for me eh aku aku I like to keep my circle of friends close macam just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know sebab to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial macam mana eh
you know kawan kosong and kawan that is really true
ya so back to your question where kalau the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you it's hard it's hard to say macam for me you know I just say but if I were to
tapi what I I can advice macam
tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
macam you you know kita aku case macam the clown eh macam the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the kita ni ni macam podcast eh tapi macam okay for those who tak tahu
aku I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert macam I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met mahirah kan macam okay dia macam pendiam tau but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
tapi uh mahirah aku
ya it take a long time not years lah tapi but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no aku respect kau sebab okay you you call yourself introvert right
but you are successful kau
for those who tak tahu
kau chairperson seh kau your leadership skill is really aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik err sebab your leadership is the best
and those who don't know don't know tapi once you find good people right you you stick to them macam for me thank you for being
my friends chey macam sedih pulak jiwang kenapa pulak sebab sebab it's true it's true
ya around sec two is where we kita more like kita dah kenal sec one but sec two is the year where
kita macam eh dia ni dah gila dia ni dah gila
kita punya gila-gila dah start kita punya gila-gila kita punya hantu hantu setan dah start eh dah start eh ya that's that's tapi wow those are the great days no those were the days where kita don't give a shit about appearance wise you know what I mean
kita kalau like eh how beauty what ever no kita macam kalau kau baik kau
kawan macam kau boleh gang dengan kita go ahead like come advice kita takde macam
seek uh clique clique mana ada kita open seh open macam ni
whoever nak join join asalkan kau uh you have that
you I mean uh sometimes you are good you know I mean kau kau orang baik tak payah macam pandai ke apa tak payah tak we don't we don't we don't do that
no kita tak kita tak
ya and now that we are matured right kita punya topic pun makin mature eh
friend pun kita dah macam we we we talk about mature stuff now and also confirm kita ada joke around but
we we kita takde mahu kita we we don't like really like judge people I think
tapi that's that's the that's the good thing about our
yes aku aku respect beauty those people who I find really pretty right aku macam aku macam respects seh like you know what I mean like like macam celebrities I would like wah
like wow you know what I mean macam uh models yang macam handsome pun aku macam wow you know like
aku aku take that as a role model you know like wow that that is
macam wow lah you know what I mean
there are some macam kau tahu you know mira filzah tak
dia punya beauty kan
and her personality oh my god dia full package you know she got the personality she got the great voice dia punya voice kan lemah lembut kan and then dia pun lawa dia dia okay
dia tak lawa lawa tau
but her lawa is very sweet type you know what I mean macam kau like sedap mata memandang you know what I mean macam you you you can just like look macam
that kind of beauty aku macam respect sia aku aku aku tabik
wah that is good that is the best kalau you've you got the full package you know that you are beauty and then you are humble about it wah
kalau kalau western pun kau kau handsome tak western kalau western hollywood style
kalau aku siapa eh
okay we we okay we we don't know like their personality how lah but but there we but we appreciate their dia orang punya beauty
yes we appreciate kita tak macam
jealous or judge you know like eh rambut kau lawa tak tak eh no no uh when when we judge is because kau punya character
like like you you are you you you are pretty but then you are like very snobbish or like you are very arrogant and that that is when we like macam alamak come on lah you waste you waste your beauty
why waste your beauty but you know some people don't know that macam
like macam you know what I mean it's it's how you are brought up juga lah how does everyone
she's beautiful to me and her character macam yang macam motherly kind of uh you know what I mean of how she brings me out aku
of a role model like wow like like macam
macam kita kita we wanna be someone like that you know what I mean

and and how dia macam ajar like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
macam ajar then wah
um tak payah cakap pasal beauty lah it's macam dia punya attitude wise you know what I mean
the is that tapi kalau macam if you want to say like like western punya or like macam barat
uh pelakon ke apa kan then I would say neelofa
is the ya malaysian punya actress host uh business woman sebab kan uh kalau kau tak tahu kan dia buat this brand apa yang neelofa punya tudung and then she's she's she's successful sampai pergi uh
milan uh to the the business berkembang
she is a great uh host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something dia masih belum berpunya she's still single but her driven of uh being that success both dunia and akhirat aku boleh cakap
it's it's like wah macam
it's something that macam you god bless you you know
uh role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and uh of a islam uh muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing apa tadi kau nak cakap
betul betul betul the I mean the the the life the hereafter lah
ya tu oh my god singapore living ya
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is wow I think memang it's very rare no not just both tapi your character pun baik your personality pun baik
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost macam
role model lah I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man yang macam you know that you have okay for the guys handsome uh bekerjaya and um uh apa we can cakap apa faithful is it faithful and then um of a good personality then
memang susah nak cari but these are the people yang macam you risau tapi again to those yang kita okay kita boleh uh rumuskan eh sebab we got like a few more minutes tapi um what I can say is that we shouldn't just um we shouldn't just
uh okay what's that word eh I want to say that this kau tahu kan macam kita kita jangan just tengok yang lawa kita just tengok yang handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't err okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance sebab
it will just make you rasa diri you yang kalau you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we atau whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down what like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this macam successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself kalau just you know what I mean like
betul you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of uh just be humble be kind I think kalau at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character betul tak
so just ya just be on that don't worry kalau
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly macam choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you macam you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know bila
so then you just be humble lah macam
you know what I mean macam we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then baru kita move on to ten years down the road what should we
macam it it it has come to a point where
macam because of beauty lah because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself ni macam takde value
and it has come to a point where macam whatever people take one for me aku macam mengalah aku like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
to have like prioritise in me sebab I I tend to like
to like macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang seh
you know what I mean so it has I should be more macam have that confidence which I I aku tu tu last time eh tu last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
so to the next ya uh future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road apa kau punya advice
true true that is that is important and macam to just have that little selfishness in you so that
ni is important betul okay
ellen punya ellen put aside eh tapi tapi
betul this is my pendirian I know where
higher status kau manager your kau they treat me they treat us macam kita ni beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I aku macam to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day aku
treating people nice is you is a must sebab how can you judge sebab I got people around me macam they they judge okay for example
kalau kau punya job uh macam uh cleaning wise ke apa kan
kau why would you uh I've seen this this is another topic err like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern eh I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because uh kita they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like uh kuli we are like beginner
kita macam baru masuk industry then they they they bully us they they not just uh okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment tapi if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like macam kita sampah or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like oh my god you you you you forget where you where you start you kau kau dah lupa diri kan this is what happen when kita lupa diri so I I I just want to advice myself that oh my god please
nadia don't ever lupa diri sebab one day kalau I get that extra money ke I get that extra title ke I might forget about myself and people below me
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know bila this uh blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's uh

oh abeh kena apa analyse
tak tapi aku tahu cerita dia pasal apa ah
yang hot air balloon eh bukan hot air balloon macam balloon dia atas

ke rumah dia naik atas ah
javani ah tapi then like
dia nanti kadang kadang berbual pasal gini ah
dia kata breakfast lunch dinner semua is all social construct kan ah ah
there's only one in a few times ah tapi banyak kali macam
nanti kalau berbual dengan dia kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk dengan dia so macam kadang kadang aku macam just borak dengan dia macam biasa kan tapi kadang kadang nanti ada intellectual talk
abeh dia nya intellectual memang bagus ah macam entah budak budak soci semua gitu eh
ah macam fikir ah gitu macam dia macam that time pun kita discuss pasal
in macam different races in singapore ke tak payah macam gitu ah
ah habis kita cakap all the pointers macam actually tak payah semua
aku rasa kita kena ah
entah aku rasa tak tahu cause macam
okay maybe in the future then tak payah aku rasa in the future macam sekarang still kena ah cause
no ah macam sekarang terlalu awal macam I mean right now technically kau nampak orang kau dah tahu dia india melayu atau cina kan
in the future pasal aku rasa there will be like a lot of cross cultural nya marriage ah mixed
sampai kan dah terlalu banyak mix then dah susah
nak categorise so in the future baru macam tak payah categorise ah
ye lah ye lah
tapi macam
okay abeh kalau macam kau dah mix like
dalam kau ada lapan bangsa macam mana
ye lah kau macam macam one quarter ni one quarter tu one eighth
let's say let's say macam okay if your dad is like half malay half chinese then mak kau is like half indian half eurasian
ah bila dapat anak macam mana
alien eh tak
macam mana seh tu
then ah kalau race ikut bapa jer kan macam
it's not it's not accurate kan pada kau accurate ke aku rasa tak ah
and pada aku you shouldn't like ah
macam pelik seh I mean race is something like you're born with so kau tak boleh choose seh
construct ah ye lah
oh tak maksud aku
ye lah okay it's not fair cause macam
cause then mak dia punya side macam mana like
kira kan it's unfair for macam mak dia punya side ah
macam kalau the race just ikut bapa dia
let's say kalau race ikut bapa dia dia tak macam melayu tapi dia bukan melayu pe actually dia mix still mix what
then lagi satu apa tadi yang second nya
aku just rasa pelik tau macam you're born and then macam kau choose your race and then some people choose cause of nak dapat benefits ke apa ah tu dah macam
kau boleh choose to
ah betul lah tapi that time aku dengar macam kalau kau cina
err okay kalau kau melayu kan kau bila jual rumah
kalau boleh jual rumah to melayu atau india tak boleh jual to cina
ah potential punya customers sikit and then
and then cause of that kan the value of your house will drop kira kau sell at a lower price ah
tak lah tak lah ada satu word
as in oh okay okay okay boleh lah
yishun orang gila semua kat sana
kan actually betul pe tak eh yishun besar so
betul juga ah tapi ya lah like
kalau dorang buat a quota for private housing then
tak ramai seh melayu dengan india beli kan
kesian seh yang melayu kat situ
kau dah besar kau nak beli rumah apa
okay kalau kalau kau ada duit untuk beli condo will you buy a condo and will you stay in the condo
kira ambitious eh kau
macam sorang ah
oh macam macam gini eh oh okay okay okay okay
tak ada tak ada eh wait ada ada ah aku pernah hantar makan
kat those rumah
macam gini juga ah tapi mahal dia tapi mahal
ya mm pasal ada balcony okay dia dua tingkat dia tapi dua tingkat
ah all the units semua ada dua tingkat
sort of ah dia dia macam ah dua tingkat kan tapi atas is studio apartment
then kat bawah is like the living room and the bedroom ah so it's like macam
mm kira kau boleh overlooked the first floor kan ah cause
aku rasa government buat gitu pasal they want to encourage ah encourage families macam to live with their parents
so if studio apartment kat atas macam parents nya bedroom dengan
ada ada satu ah apa lagi satu pintu kat atas there's two gate satu pintu
ah then connected by tangga ah
aku ada ni ah aku ada sedara yang tinggal kat sana
tak ah
not nice ah dia nya studio apartment atas kecil gila
ya studio ah tapi not nice ah and then like macam pasal makcik pakcik aku da tua kan so like sometimes the whole day dorang kat atas jer tak turun bawah pun
cause everything is ah malas macam kaki pun sakit pe so tak boleh turun bawah
ya pasal dorang ada dapur kecil juga kat atas
ah then dorang nya living ah living room rak kecil and then bedroom dah
oh back to the question so kira kau nak beli condo ah
kira kau nak beli condo ah bila kau dah besar
ah seh aku pun
ya kalau ada macam gitu I I nak
I don't know ah I I mean aku macam tak nak beli private housing
for investment purpose okay ah tapi untuk tinggal tak ah
um aku nak aku punya kids macam
main kat playground lari lari
tak tapi aku nak more macam
not just playground kira dorang nak main bawah blok okay aku kasi dia main bawah blok lepastu dorang main dengan budak budak
ah at those area kan dorang punya kawan ah dorang main main
ah then ah gitu ah abeh
tinggal pun everything is dekat macam private property jauh sia serious serious ada yang macam jauh abeh like very secluded aku tak suka ah actually honestly aku prefer macam
kalau dia punya neighbourhood macam bising sikit
macam so kira macam best ah kecoh macam happening ah ya
ah bising tapi in a good way nya bising ah macam
budak budak semua main semua ah not bising
matrep naik motor perah motor lepak ah not that type of macam tempat ah

see see see my nose tengok hidung
ya I I ya semua kat rumah I yang tadi keluar
yang keluar breakfast
uh mister teh tarik is
uh apa eh
what why apa no
as in part uh like me lah apa
so you said so so you just agak-agak lah
sembarang ah
can see not tak nampak
ni I'm pointing at it ni
ah pukul dua belas
but then jurong west tak banyak shift ah
jurong west tak banyak shift
every time I check for shift right banyak kat sengkang
ya tak ada
kalau macam dapat degree or
that that that time my friend uh intern dekat vietnam then she she went to what what was it ah
I forgot I forgot ah it's it's uh apa beach area ah
singapore punya different
at ni ah ni pun ada apa malaysia
kesian ah
uncle janggut
then boleh cakap jepun
buy a kampung house over there
she's busy jaga ija
jangan ah
her like stomach area sakit
sakit perut also not sakit perut
then from the living room I pergi buka pintu for my mum
then I gostan a bit and see
cun-cun my mum also ah
come bagi salam asalammualaikum warahmatullah then I'm like mak mak mak mak tak tahu apa nak buat then her carry her barang pasar
but I don't know what she's doing now ah I think dia tengah baring tidur
main-main you see
uh what are all those memes people makan the pot
tak tak I should recommend this to
front load tak boleh ni apa
is it macam laundromat
macam mana nak hmm
ya that was back then lah but sekarang dah kena buang kan so tak ada guna ah nak tengok tu semua balik
so aku rasa lebih aman ah kat sana
ah saudi arabia ah mecca rasanya kat mecca sana semua
no aku
uh aku tak pasti ah apa pasal corruption ni semua tapi I did read over the news that uh ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself ah but then
amazing I would say sebab dorangnya taste
a bit different from asian nya culture dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit lah and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I will to get a chance to meet messi ah you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him ah tapi
disebabkan COVID period kan aku rasa no chance lah nak gi sana nak jumpa atau maybe kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada chance kot
maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau in singapore
so far aku rasa dorang dah main dah start main cuma it's just that no ah spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will ah suffer a lot of loss ah cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue lah
actually tu yang aku pelik ah but then uh I did make a research ah on the internet and I found out that uh they make money through uh fans memberships the merchandises like example err satu apa ni baju bola kan they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe what so kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover lah you know before the
ya aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat facebook apa semua especially in singapore err aviation macam-macam kerja ah ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya err kita tengok singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial ah aids to um singaporeans ah
ah tak lah sekarang aku rest jer kat rumah sebab uh apa to stay close ah with my family
sebab you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective lah but I would say it's hard lah ah you know to find a job that ah that is suitable with me tapi
ye lah aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit savings aku ah alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat save for the past err
months that I've been working as air steward kalau tak mungkin aku kerja lah cari mana-mana kerja
aku actually risau juga cuma
alhamdulillah again aku dapat save quite a lot
I mean aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau kan but then ya I would err the savings that I save
oh ye lah aku
aku baca hari tu kat facebook juga
ah apa kerja as a swabber is it they could earn like
maybe cause err they are finding people who are willing to work uh a risk a risky job lah tu pasal they are willing to pay that much
tapi to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer lah sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi maybe it's better if government pay them lah you know
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera lah you know tapi
nak cakap susah memang lah susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan kan jadi tu lah aku pun wonder on how singapore would cope with this um COVID nineteen lah
and tu pasal aku rasa penting lah untuk err ada plan lah untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada family atau beli rumah aku rasa
err you know a lot of children I don't know lah maybe for them it's a rezeki but in terms of singapore context
primary school children kan tak payah bayar school fees ke or maybe edusave bagi lebih banyak sikit ke you know
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this aku kadang-kadang pening ah sebab aku dapat gaji jer aku kena kasi
apa ni adik-adik aku eh sorry adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik kan aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar bill aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi ah then aku kadang-kadang barely aku cuma ada kadang-kadang five hundred for myself like in every month
so walaupun I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
I mean I sometimes I really wonder macam mana orang-orang yang err sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak lah you know rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar tau dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar bill
being raped which I'm totally uh angry about tapi tu lah aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk singapore mungkin kalau aku ironman mungkin aku akan pergi sana lah aku nak save dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa kan dorang ah
tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau err ye lah sedara kau sendiri
tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil I mean mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi
ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua I really
ya I really err I'm really disappointed that um the muslims are treated that way and also another case is sekarang ni happening in this world is
uh present representation of the whole community and as you can see in eh aku tengok err kenapa police dorang err
apa treat all those uh black people with such violence and brutality
where recently kalau kau tengok news err satu orang dorang siapa nama dia george floyd was killed
err aku tak tahu apa yang tak
police police tu fikir lah sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa err orang tu dia setakat err apa ni ada fake duit jer which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
err orang masih boleh you know kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa kan aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma
dekat sana ada this thing called bumiputera where the malays are given
wanted to buy this house at taman melawati lah you know in kuala lumpur or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
you have you don't have that bumiputera rights where you can
should be bersyukur you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually kan kalau dorang gi klinik they could actually
they uh dorang cuma perlu bayar one ringgit jer tau one ringgit for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
they err they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke I mean
okay ah berdosa tu dah another level dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat
duit eh rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
kapal apa yacht eh I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something wah that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister lah like that you know what you think about that
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and mesti dia akan dapat lawyer yang bagus-bagus ah and he might win the case and just uh go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years ah so
is a joke you know is a joke you know kau kau tengok ah kita punya uh how how well
actually actually memang ada tapi err
uh he he's called the yang berhormat speaker you know he's the man in the centre that uh will call on each uh each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
I really err you know in melayu ah they say kesian ah with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say eh speaker diam lah eh speaker apa ini you know they are very chaotic you know and
bro uh I don't find it weird ah cause sebab apa tau
all of the ministers actually ada fake degree you know he actually beli
di apa a fake degree on internet or something or apa eh dia suruh orang
pergi ambil degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something lah I mean memalukan seh kau
I mean kau dah tak
kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat kan sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus and
are recruited uh based on merit lah you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya aku aku happy ah macam singapore ada government yang stable ah walaupun ye lah ramai kata apa lah ni minister ni tak bagus lah minister tu tak bagus tapi
aku rasa kita nya government quite stable lah and aku happy to see that ya
eh actually aku terima soalan ni banyak gila ah dulu kan aku
aku fikir aku nak duduk malaysia the reason being is that
ah the peace and financial freedom mungkin sebab masa tu I mean still uh sampai sekarang lah aku masih kerja kat singapore kan and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted uh into the malaysian currency it's time apa times three apa so satu dolar tiga ringgit and you when you go there kau boleh spend apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa spa apa bagai and kau boleh buat apa-apa ah tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana
and kau kerja kat sana eh you might not be uh spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia ringgit example you are earning two thousand ringgit in malaysia
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik bus atau naik motor pergi kerja sini and okay lah mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
sebab ya the you know the okay example kau bangun pukul empat pagi then kau kerja sampai lima pagi and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam
and you know kau barely have time for yourself ah you know kau rasa kau akan do that for a long term or
you know try to spend two thousand ringgit in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand ringgit I mean
of course ah it's not easy for them I mean aku pun ada sedara kat malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in ah you know dalam kampung-kampung semua and um kalau kat singapore apa orang kata is it or gross income lah dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit
atau seribu lima ratus ringgit and
it's still tak cukup you know cause they are living in a dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang I mean mungkin barang-barang murah tapi
ye lah barang-barang lain macam bill makanan apa semua lah macam-macam and still tak cukup untuk dorang so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles ah so we cannot justify on what they are facing ah but kan in singapore itself it's very hard you know
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is haram
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore lah you know penting gila I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to tolong you to to uh you know to give duit I mean
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains ah birth rate in singapore is declining kan orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab
ya dorang risau kan apa tak uh tak ada tak cukup duit lah tak ada time and
aku tak faham ah kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada maid aku tak akan ambil maid untuk jaga anak aku sebab
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know besar I want to saya aku nak besar kan anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan
setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them kasih sayang lah kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau you know dibesarkan dijaga oleh maid and maybe one day dorang tak kenal kau atau maybe dorang sayang maid lebih dari kau
gitu lah I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important lah singapore kan kalau kau
kau kau bayang kan kau spend
it's not even compulsory pun to have your own wedding
so yang penting I mean in our religion islam kita nikah dah cukup
tak penting pun then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend dekat kau punya rumah kau can pay lebih deposit
ya lah aku rasa rumah and uh duit um savings untuk anak kau lagi penting lah
I don't know ah okay sekarang sekarang err I'm in army kan so
ya I think sekarang sudah tak boleh tak boleh pergi
like you cannot go places a lot of places ah banyak banyak banyak tempat tak boleh pergi
atau dia punya ada limit
ada limit to entry ah
err kalau ah tak tak tak sekarang masih masih five juga
ah betul
mm bukan ah
I don't know but I think tengok tengok apa like orang lain yang instagram stories nampak
ada ramai orang cakap tak ada in the same venue tapi
so macam
ah macam pagi family then err petang just kawan-kawan dengan friends
oh iya ke
ah yours is ah that yang yang jemputan
ah evening semalam only semalam I posted about it
so macam it's a bit contradictory
macam err
memang I don't keep myself up to date that much

I sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang kan
okay kalau tengok in army in army
berbeza kalau compared to police dengan itu memang
macam for example pack

this is gonna be super senang for me
apa okay
ya alah so this is my last semester kan sekarang so
classes that's only like once a week so aku macam like
but it's so much like cause the previous semesters uh I was like so freaking like stressed but now I'm still stressed lah you know sebab sekolah standard but now I feel like
so I was supposed to submit an assignment not assignment lah like a task macam homework yesterday but then like she didn't give me my feedback sought
aku mad ah so I didn't submit
for my time table tak banyak apa punya classes
macam like start at like twelve but like the bad part is balik rumah like lambat so
kau stand out sikit lah
no kau tahu that kind of situation where ada orang wave kat kau and then they're not actually waving at you
so why so kenapa kau mad kat aku for the okay uh huh
so kau fikir yang
you thought like I was giving you some uh attitude gitu lah okay got it
oh kau tengah flex on aku pasal dover dover oof
sometimes I really miss just like being able to like pergi sekolah kau without
I thought kata takde like COVID punya
orh I think confirm like my sekolah mala is like
confirm ah tak halal mala
cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean punya stall aunty dia kata
oh aku dapat apa ada mala and I saw like my malay friend apa apa nama dia uh izzah from izzah is from band remember izzah my
yang tu ya ya ya
pray I was like to allah to count my blessings semua
no I have you eaten there before kau pernah makan
oh ya the daging mahal ya
that time aku makan dengan arlef uh makan mala dekat I think it was last year
the duck rasa lemak dia sedap
your bapa never let you go makan
macam not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one yang at Ichikokudo
to me rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak because aku makan dia punya
the fact that it's garlic dia dah cut
but it was super like lemak for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
ya stomach aku ada problem bro aku tak boleh makan spicy food period
tapi I that time I eh you know oh my god I forgot to tell you about this
no because when you add less of the sauce dia punya flavor
to me untuk aku because Samyang kan uh the normal noodles dia punya calories about five hundred
sebab you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
to me dia nya carbonara dia nya rasa terlampau
almost bukan
dia nya rasa almost bukan Samyang and babe abeh dia punya noodles also not macam
something that aku eat
aku tak makan that kind of stuff
kau makan dia punya cup atau dia punya
no cup atau the packet
oh aku prefer aku think there's a like a
the cup one I feel like it doesn't like kau try makan Samyang cup biasa not even carbonara the texture semua lain what
no kenyal is like err perkataan yang betul
oh you kau tengah looking through universities eh
paolo kat yes correct
oo aku uh dia punya course is uh sciences sosial
kejap eh
oh dorang ada human resource dengan uh itu
passionate tentang human resource
okay aku I I know akan
sound a bit dunia
I don't know tapi sebab
macam aku really nak try pergi overseas ah
aku just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
macam a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm aku looking at western australia nya uni kan kat perth
abeh dia punya fees about thirty eight thousand
tiga puluh lapan ribu uh per tahun
if aku punya is eligible untuk scholarship
abeh accommodation I can stay with my uncle tapi dia punya orang was like betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan uncle kau
ya abeh when she was talking to me dia kata are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea kan untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua
so aku fikir forty thousand extra that's
true sebab aku punya uncle dengan aku punya aunty dorang punya rumah is
quite near to university tau like macam actually dekat
abeh dorang ada banyak bilik spare cause dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin
tapi kalau gitu I have to take a gap year untuk kerja dapat duit
ya abeh kerja kat mana
dah start eh
a'ah betul
dah besar lah
mak dia nak ikut dia pergi overseas
oh mak dia attached to her eh
no but sebab dia dia youngest in the family what so I think it's like expected ah
tapi what I thought you said she's like financially like
tapi her mum let lah is it taking a loan
daphne is the one yang
oh tapi when kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau do you guys talk about pelajaran atau completely like no
oh so your yours are just casual friends ah like bukan competitive
oh korang macam united ah
eh tapi elisa dia nak pergi university mana satu
dorang ada plan
tapi elisa mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak
kerja sana kan
kau tahu tak the main macam
sebab that people nak pergi negeri lain kan is because dorang nak migrate tau
like for example kan aku pergi uh perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go macam for
like uh someone from singapore dorang nak uh apa
belajar kat america boston university
so it's like it's meant to like macam
facilitate dorang untuk keluar negeri kita
so macam like the thing about ambil
I saw this uh tweet pasal this guy they took a hundred thousand loan tak salah aku hundred thousand ke hundred fifty thousand untuk uh go to apa university di america
abeh lepas tu he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary tujuh ribu
so it's like macam the starting pay is a lot what seven thousand is a lot eh
ya I mean if I feel like in negeri america
dorang nya starting pay quite high seh
untuk ah aku punya perspective
no bukan hope it's more of worry macam if aku pergi overseas education what if aku tak boleh bayar balik
right ten year gitu kan
mmhmm abeh ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure aku punya university aku make as much memories as possible
kalau boleh aku nak give it another run lah
not choose my class kau tahu kan time aku masuk poly I actually chose to be in O two
and that time dina was my only friend kawan aku satu jer
so aku was like okay let me just be in the same class as dina but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
I think kalau boleh aerospace sia
but ya so about local university kau nak pergi mana satu and like
not like like course sebab I know kau tak tahu like
uh kau I think I can see you're like interested dalam
bidang uh social services
is it kau punya internship open up your eyes
oh kau tak nak ah
the jutawan di dalam kelas kamu
aku percaya dia ah
oh return of investment gitu eh
um okay investment aku boleh percaya
tapi hundred thousand tu aku tak boleh percaya
oil banyak ah tapi
mana parents dia dapat duit tu untuk start investment in the first place
oh kalau gitu aku macam boleh percaya sikit
ah sikit ah
uh tapi okay lah makes sense tapi ya you were saying dia punya internship
oh kau share tentang internship kau eh
uh huh tu nanti
ya period abeh dia end up kerja di mana
tapi same place tapi online
dia business vibes ah
oh tentang addison rae
aku just I think I'm aku just
dia seorang businesswoman yang sangat gigih
dia jumpa kourtney kardashian
aku rasa kan dia yang paling banyak um
dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira all the time
no no the thing the thing yang aku sedikit marah
eh marah
kau do you know avani
kau pernah nampak videos dia tak
no no no kau pernah nampak video dia tak
dengan james charles eh
no aku rasa the only reason I mean I know you say jangan tengok video dia kalau tak suka kan
tapi the only the thing is I don't think dia deserve all this fame
dia punya ya
aku tengok dia collab dengan james charles tau di YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely sangat bosan as a person like I literally macam couldn't
ya abeh charli d'amelio pun aku rasa she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
ni something yang aku have been thinking about ah serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers kau kata yes ke tak
no aku rasa okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli d'amelio is dia punya latest video dengan maddie ziegler
the dorang buat makeup
dan the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya that itu apa apa aku fikir lah tentang situasi ini
but then again their net worth is like berapa million so aku have nothing on them
oh okay aku faham
cuma aku just uh aku baik dengan dorang aku aku think dorang sangat
dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan stuff like that
tapi I just don't think they deserve this much followers lah
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like macam
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine semua orang dalam uh
phone dorang so
and I think dorang punya it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think dorang deserve all these big opportunities you know
yang uh miniman yang baru eh
oh yang trend baru eh
no I don't aku tak minum Starbucks ah bro
oh kau dapat anxiety macam mana
oh ya malam tu eh
kau that time yang aku minum kopi aku nak pass out kau ingat
ya no is yang I drank the whole cold brew remember
yang kita minum tau it's like that coffee drink
that night yang aku nak pass out sebab aku exercise after that
ya aku nya heart was already like dying aku literally was like
abeh I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like macam complicates things aku literally was like about to pass out
drink coffee at all that time aku minum uh
I didn't like I eat at twelve you know like usual lunch tapi aku belum makan dinner and it was already like six and I was already very hungry no snacks nothing
so I was like hmm mak aku ada instant coffee so aku nak try minum jer lah
so aku minum then after that it was okay
but then I ate dinner at about seven thirty gitu like one hour later
time aku makan dinner suddenly aku rasa macam light not light-headed tau macam
abeh tu semua masa nak pass out terus I had to like stop dinner and like sit and like drink water
ya weird kan aku banyak pass out situations sia
ya tak boleh serious
aku macam aku just don't drink air flavoured ah
uh usually I get the like the like the fruity type macam kat rumah amira that time I drank
aku constantly telling you
Sharetea nya lemak kan rasa dia
it's like sikit tea
like two per cent tea abeh ninety nine per cent milk
dekat Dunkin' kau beli matcha I didn't know what doughnuts you buy but anyways

uh dia nya first yang basic dengan
okay not to flex tapi aku aku masuk
uh aku masuk bilik aku masuk lambat kan dia nya final theory room
oh student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means kau manual tak yah naik tak yah itu ke
or maybe sebab kau sekolah bukan private
kau next time kau tanya instructor kau ah when's your next uh lesson driving
tak ada opening
he only manjas me when he need something macam nak makan gitu baru he come to me
tapi kalau tak he ignore me he got attitude one
tapi semalam molly macam manja dengan aku sikit so aku macam okay

kenapa bad terms
macam mana amira tahu yang safirah nangis
apa safirah kata
no aku aku macam tak
but aku just feel like safirah do you think safirah overreact atau like she react accordingly
aku just tak suka rafi ah
no macam when I first nampak rafi I knew I I wasn't gonna like him
but most of the time aku punya intuition is right though whenever I have a bad feeling about someone it always happens
wait what other things aku I remember like getting a lot of things right macam regarding all these sus things
but aku feel like aku reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because aku rasa just safirah is like overreacting
ya tak no kejap aku nak explain dengar aku dulu
okay so basically yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan xu shi aku xu shi dengan safirah makan
safirah kan masuk Instagram dia then I was like I told safirah I'm super angry
aku macam nak message dia gitu ah macam just to
say everything ah macam like why you do this to safirah and all abeh safirah was like no
cause she dia tak reply aku tau do you dia reply kau
abeh apa perasaan kau when dia reply
apa perassan kau when safirah replied
apa kau punya fikiran tentang business dari rumah
oh kau suka makan benda manis-manis eh
oh ya doughnuts are nice to me aku suka doughnuts tapi it's like air
aku that time the last time aku makan doughnuts is the Swee Heng aku suka yang that kind of doughnuts
yang sedap yang besar abeh ada chocolate rice kat atas so sedap
ya I feel like Dunkin' Donut nya lagi air airy
kan macam tak tak tak kenyang
oh kau suka complicated flavours ah kira kan
aku just rasa
sedikit sedih ah tentang this situation
safirah needs I told I told my mum about situasi safirah tau about the entire break up
abeh aku macam aku I know safirah dia terlampau serious untuk relationship
kahwin which is good
is bukan perkara yang jahat tau untuk buat gini
tapi aku rasa dia terlampau serious when the guys are literally like
mana macam it's macam tak add up gitu
like dia nak settle down sekarang which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
like when dia message dia kata oh kenapa semua orang atau semua orang masih sekolah
she's nineteen lah I mean like kalau nak kahwin at least twenty three baru find a real like a serious one lah
I feel like it's a bit macam terlampau cepat
my mum my mum said macam you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle macam kau percaya orang ni
abeh last last dia pecah kan hati kau macam gitu jer
ya tapi aku just feel bad ah
then macam do you know about safirah punya parents
no but because like I was also telling my mum like macam my mum said if you come from a stable family
like most likely you won't be out there macam looking for like
no macam like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
that was uh itu yang terjadi kepada irfan apa the first time also
dia punya dorang nya family messed up kan irfan nya
ya eh ni ni skirt yang kau pakai that day eh yang plaid ni
buat kan
sebab dah besar kan
moyang apa ah
damn you saw your moyang
okay uh kau nak start
aku join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed aku gi
ada ada minat ah so aku tak ada problem
eh tapi
aku tengah doing muay thai
dari silat then go squash
aku tak tahu is just
it's not my thing ah dikir barat
tak tahu ah aku rasa stage fright
then maybe because of that abeh dikir barat as I see is quite interesting ah like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
that's the difference ah aku sebab
err that is macam
macam tu aku fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school aku
uh sepak takraw pe so
that that competition macam orang tengok is normal
aku since young uh aku
not really sociable lah aku is a introvert ya
since primary school lah aku introvert so
but primary school lah aku still had this macam close friends so aku still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
still join takraw which is good and made a lot of friends there
okay that's the tough part sebab aku
aku didn't really got problem thus aku student counsellor so so aku tak boleh macam mess up lah so basically but the student council part also aku it wasn't
and then err dorang kira kan
sebab aku really from a
aku considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor lah in sec two ya
aku actually tak nak sebab aku just just malas ah then so uh the funny thing is
aku didn't even go for the interview even though I had to lah
dorang dorang naik dekat uh assembly hall panggil aku dorang tanya err
okay aku cakap ah I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say oh you got duty today then I'm like what
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya nanti ada orang hantar aku
go to sick bay nanti aku cakap stomachache and all that
guilty tak sangat right ya then
but to be honest aku rasa dorang tahu lah tapi dorang just macam
macam okay ah can just go just go
aku first job aku was uh burger king which aku finds
so aku just join and then they quickly like train me
after staff day takde lagi
kind of lah because dorang macam err kira kan
uh business kecil so uh
macam referral kan so aku kerja
I think aku dapat thirty forty
kau kerja is a different environment
so kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam some ah a'ah macam gitu just at some park or some event
eh apa dah kerja
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about sebab aku lagi prefer hands on
rather than macam
so next year kita dua gi internship
you quite excited ah untuk shore
uh aku
so aku gi belayar second sem
which is exciting ah untuk aku sebab aku pun join sebab dia punya sailing the part
exciting tapi
scary juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam
sebab aku pun planning uh
aku start family and all that so ya
even though internship kau dapat shore kan
aku rasa there's still a chance untuk kau sail in the future you know macam kalau kau still carry on with this career then aku rasa why not kau ada dia punya diploma kau ada experience
takyah disappointed sangat
kau stuck at shore
yes sebab untuk aku err
aku rather sacrifice
aku punya time untuk uh
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine macam
ah exactly jadi untuk aku macam it's worth it lah kau go for six months
then got free for like like three months gitu three or more then
macam by the time aku reach macam tiga puluh empat puluh is
even workshop takpe sia fun so
aku suka ah
honestly following the trend kan aku rasa aku
we'll probably be posted to firefighting tapi personally aku nak army
ya sebab
aku tak tahu ah aku just
aku ada interest in the armed forces juga
kira the army navy ataupun air force ah
tapi firefighting pun untuk aku okay
tapi aku really tak nak
um macam dari dari kecil
aku main bola bawah blok ke apa kan atau aku gi skate ke apa nanti dorang datang screen abeh
ya and then since young aku had that uh
image of them macam dorang just
datang sini screen screen macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah
err aku pergi seven eleven beli maggi apa kan aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang screen check check EZ-link semua aku don't find it
macam practical lah macam kau just kacau aku kan at this point ah so I never really had the interest for police
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag aku
maybe dorang check rokok ke apa abeh aku
aku just found it like like weird lah to be honest like until now also I still feel
I I take it personally ah sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at nanti dorang tengok aku
dorang tengok eh kadang-kadang dorang panggil and dorang check bag aku macam just
but ya that's why aku tak nak police
then kau
eh tapi air force
macam mana nak cakap eh
macam ada engineering punya part ada communications punya part
I because to be pilot also susah
kalau dorang offer kau untuk macam uh continue
posted to air force eh kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam
I think boleh tau sebab the thing is I went for the
ah ada dorang macam test kau punya
so macam
err aku betul-betul nak so
months before that kan aku aku practice with this movie so aku aku tengok youtube video
aku take online test
unfortunately aku tak dapat ah dorang tak bilang score
sebab dia ada aku rasa eight to ten different tests
uh ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah
honestly overall aku rasa aku did not bad
ya so tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat
okay obviously kalau ada
aku aku definitely would
honestly kalau
the job areas like engineering atau uh communications
kalau pilot lah who don't mind
sebab dia punya cockpit dia ada dia punya ah
aku tengok macam national days semua kan nanti ada dia punya jet like cool lah untuk aku
sama sama sama six years
so macam aku untuk aku primary school is when you develop your own uh character
sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku primary macam the most important
but ya primary school aku is uh
I think to through sepak takraw also
err develop aku punya own personality
is aku
I'm a quite macam quiet person
jadi aku dalam class pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual
err tapi bila aku join takraw baru aku macam
uh jumpa orang-orang ni semua and
I was quite good at it ah sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw
and then the coach was the one that macam kira recruit aku
through my brothers ah dia dia nampak aku dia cakap eh join ah join ah takraw
then then uh aku join and then
and then err it was funny ah sebab aku was
coach aku pun macam confident aku boleh main
I think by primary four aku managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four aku the captain at junior team and then primary five aku captain of senior team
ya ya that's why dari situ aku macam belajar macam this leadership roles
macam macam mana nak uh
sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku ah kat sekolah
kalau aku tak buat homework pun dorang macam marah
primary school was fun lah cause of takraw I mean
sebab kalau kalau err
tapi depending on tekong kalau dia left hand ke ya
uh kadang-kadang
and then if the tekong is left legged then feeder nak kena belajar campak
atau striker
tapi aku lagi suka striker
takraw was fun lah tu tu pun macam mana aku macam
belajar ah the
sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk nationals
queenstown primary tak pernah dengar
tapi queenstown secondary ya
oh sebab aku rasa
okay aku remember primary five
against err since the first round kita
kita beat every school
the west zone okay so kita east zone err
uh school ada east north uh west dengan south
jadi kita dari east zone
jadi kita meet all these different schools yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita beat them ah
err using basics kita tak ada macam fancy fancy semua tapi coach kita ajar macam betul-betul master your basics
kita beat all these schools from
ya tapi aku
surprisingly national that time primary five kita beat dorang juga junyuan ya so kita macam kita ada this momentum ah which starting sampai finals kita tak kalah
uh menang qihua
second team kalah
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win ah untuk champions
so macam every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus ada nama ni semua but never tampines north primary school
a'ah sia aku nangis rabak sia tu
aku really felt the responsibility ah
sebab kita punya vice principal kat situ
but the tampines north tak pernah achieve this kind of achievement
wait delta league apa
think macam
so aku
abeh aku nampak that time kau post kat instagram macam
dorang still cakap apa boys become last at least
dorang shouldn't macam just celebrate because you get at least fourth macam dorang should celebrate the change you know
wah takde love life lah okay tinggal macam four minutes
aku attached
aku jumpa dia through
dia pergi cambodia
okay so total sec two that time ada macam
ya boleh click ah so
but that time sec three uh dia suka orang lain
ah tapi aku don't mind sebab
just find her pretty you know macam I can
oh ya aku okay then
relationship dia tak work out
ya you you you kinda like macam jauh
ah how was it mm boleh lah
boleh lah
like um boleh lah macam I didn't expect it to be hard as it is
it's more to macam satisfactory lah unexpectedly good
ya ya ya and then you macam mana
mm sama sama
mm ah understood understood ya cause uh macam for me kan like uh
I don't enjoy anything online at all from ah daripada lectures
really I cannot I feel like um like like very unproductive it's like err no no is is err don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really malas
malas abeh ah tiring lagi so macam
abeh like um macam mana ah your exam punya like err format like how how was it like it's it's online right so macam like how how did it go
leceh ah leceh
oh for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like ah twenty four hours ah so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like huh forty eight hours lama gila
like the questions banyak ke like were there like a lot of questions
no difference tak ada tak ada difference
like why you using serious tak dengar
try ah cakap something
mm cause it sounds like uh err dia macam tak clear sangat so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
sangat what you trying to say ya
blur blur sikit
oh for me kan ah yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was ah twenty four hours tapi like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction tau like the instruction were like very specific so
eleven questions and then lepas tu um the eleven questions tu like ah the marks were different lah for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks ah so like um
ah for like for each question err um my lecturer specified ah like um berapa banyak words
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like um macam ah tak make tak make sense ah cause like err questions two marks jer atau three marks but like uh dia nak
dia nak um the words like limit dia like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
we had to like really um arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like um time consuming lah ah which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like tak tidur cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between ah but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
ya and then then nanti last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like err everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what um like for for me that the twenty four hours uh punya exam it was like macam
uh it was penat ah but then like
but then like uh how do I say this dia macam
my back crying for help and then ya and um like mata sakit and everything so macam err no it's not very like ya it's the worst ah I would say the whole the whole
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think boleh lepas
cause like you know you know there are times like um uh like I I attended like online lectures but then like macam like I was there but I was asleep
ya ya ya serious tak bedek
all okay cause I had this like um ah I ada kelas ni eight thirty tau eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your macam sleeping schedule semua all over the place kan like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late lepastu like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like uh um the what apa nama dia
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link ah I would join lepastu the minute I join and then like right ah terus I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think uh I bukan sorang cause ah when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like macam
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already um not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes ah apa lagi eh online like tak boleh oi
eh tapi lecturers you semua like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some macam trouble juga with certain lecturers
mm faham
most of my lecturers okay lah I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way kan macam if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's semua benda macam very baru untuk semua orang
I think everyone macam masih nak adapting to the whole new situations so it's like uh I I appreciate that uh lecturers I macam they were they were okay lah but then I did have macam trouble dengan some
lecturers ah cause like I don't know why ah tak tahu kenapa ah tapi like I ada satu lecturer ni she was like um
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why ah cause I've I I I don't err I don't macam I tak I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole um the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
um cause it's online kan abeh macam she doesn't
she expects us to err macam
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean faham lah we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so macam it wasn't helpful lah she was expecting us to only come to her only bila kita ada questions so it was like very hard for me like ah apa eh like macam cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just balik singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like macam apa tu the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
ah dia akan cakap ah apa tu
dia akan cakap okay this is the topic we're going to ah this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
on our own so macam I was like ah it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is lah to to understand to faham kan
I I understand that she she wants like kita nya level to be like of really university students tapi macam
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very leceh like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were macam banyak gila benda nak kena like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very leceh and then like
it was very leceh and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause uh uh I had to handle dengan all those um group members who are just useless
working team members which was hard lah cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like macam equally divided kan tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like um malas ah want to layan like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress ah of it but you know some did some did not so it was like ah whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did dorang tak kesah then dorang punya pasal ah
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like ah whatever ah suka hati ah nak buat pape pun boleh lah ya like ya it's like
like apa tu
uh apa nama dia like you know like bila physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
um and then uh like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours ah similar to yours like dorang kasi kita choose um nak apa tu nak individual atau group work so it was like okay lah I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya I mean it's your own your own uh I mean it's kind of scary lah to do be doing assignments like individually tapi macam you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster I mean not faster faster but you know what I mean kan like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so macam settle lah senang kan habis cerita eh but serious I'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause I'm taking are you taking the summer semester
oh dah start dah
ya one class aje okay lah tu
same cause uh for me like I haven't I haven't started sebab mm I baru I baru jer register the class
cause today is a public holiday for malaysia merdeka kan
okay tak
oh pasal apa tu
oh jadi
oh jadi
mm or the like apa tu cerita dia like is it
orh cerita cerita dia like what the whole is it like series eh
series berapa season
I don't I tak suka ah tengok series
I I don't enjoy um like I don't know like maybe sebab macam it's either like I get bored easily atau macam I'm just hard to impress ah cause I will always ah sebab selalu kalau I tengok cerita kan nanti like like if macam dia series
nanti I nak tengok halfway jer
sometimes not even halfway I will just macam ee boring ah malas done dah that's it
especially kalau cerita dia romance kan oh lagi malas no no no tak boleh I I really
ya I macam I mean
sometimes you just you know ah macam just to
just enjoy macam for entertainment macam okay ah but then
ah I would just macam be like err a bit aje ah tapi nanti bila dah get too much nanti I macam ee tak nak tak nak I'm not watching this ah especially if
kalau macam cerita dia very predictive kan no predictive predictable kan so I macam err tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I will just be like okay my last then I'm just I'm gonna finish watching it at all just
move on sebab tu I prefer tengok movies ah daripada like watching like series or like sitcoms or whatever lah you call it
so I'll see lah eh I'll check out and see kalau I managed to watch a good place then I akan bilang you lah
tapi dah habis ke the series is it like done
oh really itu jer ke tak ada cerita lain yang you boleh suggest kat I
um cause uh I when I get like macam betul-betul bored and then I would watch K drama kira like K drama is like the last resort kalau betul-betul dah boring gila then I would watch K dramas
but on a normal like day with like a lot of other things to do no like I'm not the sort lah like macam
uh what I do is macam I would watch rental videos on youtube like really anything like really like suggested stuff right I would I will just watch it macam I picit and just tengok jer
ya I mean just like every like a really a lot of things there kan and macam for me ah macam get bored easily like videos paling lama pun um fifteen twenty minutes dah lah that's it
not like not like macam really lama-lama videos like orang berbual banyak-banyak no no I would just like watch random stuff
if I macam
sometimes I watch like like really random ah like I can be watching macam ah I'll be watching like cooking shows or ya to like macam make-up stuff
or like really like random stuff like people punya like macam room tours or something I don't know I just like really just anything ah
tak tahu ah I macam sometimes tak ada pape pun I will just like
tengok jer check jer it's just like see just see jer like I I'm I do I would I'm not really active lah in terms of like posting stuff ah but I'm very active just being online and like seeing like post by other people lah
not like really really must those people who really post like stories like every day and then like have those like really small dots on their stories tak ah I'm not like that just that I just like enjoy like watching stories of other people then like macam look at other people's posts and then stalk people
not really stalk but like macam look at their profiles and like you know random stuff like really random stuff
like macam
I don't know ah it's just very fun to like read people's like thoughts for me ah macam I really macam enjoy macam baca baca tengok
ya ya ya ya tapi like macam it just makes you like macam talk to yourself like macam eh
like eh interesting eh ah macam you know got those kind of things like is
which like macam I really like ya I mean I really respect those kind of people cause I'm I would say I orang dia I'm very I'm kind of very I very opinionated actually it's just that I don't really express it out openly
ya I mean ya I mean when I do I do ah but I don't do it like all the time like when I really have things to like really express it out I would tapi macam selalunya mm no that's why I really admire people who really can talk about things like especially macam
like you see when like people really like speak up on like uh like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could macam kadang-kadang macam eh like ee I really like like at the back of my head kan macam there were like a lot of things tau I really want to say a lot of things but then like I macam oh like uh
ah uh ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish kadang-kadang I boleh just cakap jer tapi
I I feel that um my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like um follow up on what what's happening kan tapi like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this ah
ya ya ya I mean like for me macam kadang-kadang like I feel I takut kat walaupun
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
huh tapi I I I feel like macam like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited ah tapi you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words kan like you don't want to macam you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like um discussion like a healthy one lah like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like macam very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive ah so macam okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter ah
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say macam go to newspaper ah
sometimes memang mm mm sometimes memang tired ah actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me tapi
penat ah baca dorang nya tweets
I think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like semua orang to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one
oh kalau instagram
tak ah tak tak honestly instagram not really cause like
I follow a lot of people but then like um I get tired of watching stories eventually so I will just like mm I will just like like exit lah when I macam dah malas want to tengok banyak-banyak but some some stories I do enjoy ah but others like when I feel like um macam ee malas pe nak tengok I will be just like
mm mm mm sebab yang the first few ones will always be the one that you always watch right for story ah so macam okay dah tengok ni semua okay dah that's it I don't have to look at everyone's ya cause some people um for me
I feel like I I as much as macam I respect orang lain punya way of using social media sometimes I rasa macam people exposed too much and I don't want to know faham ke
mm like I mean as much as like suka hati lah you nak buat apa dengan you punya instagram tapi sometimes know what they share sometimes buat me uncomfortable so macam I sometimes tak nak tengok ya so I macam okay ya ah
oh cute gila ya cause sometimes they will just like all the um macam celebrity punya anak kan they all like ee geram lah
geram they just really I don't know it's just geram lah
especially those ah I really ah I cannot tak boleh
have you been to like macam uh any weddings like since since phase two
is it yang young counsel eh
pergi dating
letters hantar surat jer
sorry apa
tapi hantar surat like not even
and then jap
dorang hantar surat jer
tak tak like even whatsapp ke I don't know ke like like they don't use like technology form punya like
it's letter right I mean letters macam take time kan untuk like untuk reach the recipients and it's like I mean I feel like dia macam you know orang dulu dulu punya way of like coupling
okay I mean okay ah I think for me right even if you want to keep things like quote unquote macam traditional kan I would at least use email lah you know
you know letters really take a very long time and it's like all the way to medina so macam wow for me I'm I'm very impatient person so macam
like kira macam you know it's like kira macam you have to really
tulis a lot of things you wanted to to really really update you know everything in like one letter then you have to send it all the way
I mean they they macam taking it taking it slow ah
right taking it slow faham faham
macam would you
would you like if macam let's say your parents nak matchmake you would you would you like be open to it
but then okay okay okay okay okay I mean look okay if you were to change the situation kan macam for example
since you cakap you ada someone already like kira you are seeing someone tapi like if you were to change like the whole situation for example um if you are done with your studies kan dah habis belajar then like you not dating anyone
alamak tapi nak cari dekat mana
for okay bila comes to like my love life right I I'm the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe ah so if like from the start if we can't really click then I don't think that that's like hope in it so I will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right mm I think for someone like me it's gonna be hard lah it's gonna be very hard
ah I lebih prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know lah like macam like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which macam I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so macam
so macam I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I tak sure ah whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like ah similar lah to your parents my parents tak macam gitu ah so ya
dorang macam ah cari sendiri they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
um I nak lah tapi you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about ah
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first lah then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like sekarang to have love life like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so um malas lah also like
mm cause like I had like previous like history with like bad breakups so it's like I really malas and tired want to like start again and to to meet someone new no I don't want
ya ya ya malas ah
I really don't want I just macam uh like I would
I would just like I like currently just enjoy that like the apa company of like my friends regardless of gender lah like whatever guy or girl just like enjoy it being friends mm but nothing beyond that I hope
do you have an aim like macam at like age apa umur berapa
I think everyone would think like macam they would get married like after their studies no like everything will be nicely like arranged but right now I'm like
cause like I think to just have degree is not enough so like I feel like I need to like um oh like what do I say how do I say this macam build up build myself up more in terms of education baru macam stable
to have like better jobs and everything kan to have like like a proper stable career then like then then can lah then boleh lah then can lah
dah dah lama kan tak berbual so macam it's really nice we should really jumpa soon you know
ah ah ah betul
but awak awak tak rasa penting family time together to spend time with your family and then weekend tak dapat keluar sama-sama
mmhmm what about your family do they do they do they feel like they rather have you school in singapore or would they think like takpe you just belajar jer kat luar
luar negeri and then when when uh finish already graduation can come back singapore and have all the time with the family

but ya okay so kan but aku tengok video dia macam kelakar a bit lah but then
err okay aku skip to first part eh and then when so he he took this err a pair of shoes
cause this house was I don't know macam terbakar last time so ada ashes and there was something and then
so maybe the owner ada perempuan and ada a pair of shoes so this person this blogger took that pair of shoes and then put in front of the door
rumah rumah cina I guess
abeh uh huh
the the shoes is the direction is towards a door okay in front of the door so kira the pointy part of the shoes is towards the door lah kan facing the door
then so he go down you know just checking out buat kelakar cause he was scared so he sing along lah
tak handsome ah
mana ada kucing okay lah maybe maybe for us it's like ah he must have edited that lah ha
ya tu kau boleh cakap macam oo who's the one who change the direction okay so so he continued exploring the house
and then err apa
ya cause memang nampak terbakar
tak tahu ah eh
oh okay and then bila macam dia masuk
I think masuk bathroom or kitchen ah I forgot
and then suddenly like tempat tu very panas you know then dia punya tahap panas until there's a smoke come out of nowhere
dia punya fire spark and then tiba-tiba spread all the way dekat lantai so pasal kau human kan kau akan lari apa and then his live was being cut off oh he was doing live ah actually YouTube live
mm ah so he went out the house or room I don't know then dia try to put off the fire back
tak dapat semua ah only sixty percent
yang kat lantai lantai dia uh hilang kan
then bila dia
he saw the thing on fire no the room suddenly sampai
ya you remember that I said the object was like ada smoke coming out
no cause it was during circuit breaker apa
circuit breaker then ramai orang work from home so I was alone in the lab no interns no what
your tempat tinggal
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
apa tu naik one six eight jer
no dia naik one six eight then dia turun dekat jalan kayu kan
mana tahu so it's like a a palm thing sized eh
he kerja malam
kalau aku aku dah keluar seh
kurang ajar seh orang macam gitu ee
tak mahu hidup please
orang tengah kesusahan kau tak tolong eh
kurang ajar sia
today malam ah
is for orang yang buat korban kan not us
perempuan I'm not sure usually lelaki
I mean kalau kau baligh I guess I don't know
kau import
I think they will but restricted takde viewers viewers eh whatever ah ah ah ya ya
go masjid doesn't mean I always do korban what you think I'm that rich ah
no lah aiyo I don't even eat kambing
no ah only eat biryani and tulang merah
that's the only kambing that I eat
actually pada aku tak ah it depends on how you cook actually
no that's why aku very selective with like orang masak kambing kan aku tengok reviews dulu
err so far aku rasa biryani masjid jer yang sedap
you know yang yang kat sekolah kita yes tu from one of the mosques ah I don't know
it's like for four people to eat it in fact sikit jer cause they say girls always waste food
I mean don't blame us ah we finished it clean seh kita minta dua tiga kali
tu pasal seh
eh you are still growing takpe lah
I don't know korang kira the the high ah
tapi kau pernah pakai yang very tall what
ah yang penting aku tak kan
aku pernah pakai flats uh fifty which is what five no wait to
so perempuan eh
uh eh five tinggi tau
kau pernah pakai that time
siapa eh siapa nama dia fatin fatin nadirah
ah tu semua takde
no lah cause sec one aku tahu
then semua orang macam tak nak join dorang punya group so thirteen me cause I was unhappy with mumtaz then I asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then I kept eh you all want to join me kita book kita sewa bus then macam okay okay ah okay lor
aku ingat lah kau ni sec one sec one sec one aku ingat
no they were with dorang ah
ya I mean you keep blaming when like kita orang not everyone you know there's only like a group of people yang cari pasal dengan kau
actually understandable ah cause we were talking about class there what tak nak kawan macam
ah macam tersisih gitu
okay dah eh dah habis eh
but kena force take everything back
I don't want to take private okay aku tak nak stereotype ah but you look at the people who take private O level
tebalkan muka ah
and apparently I I was the only one yang retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back malu I guess so ya lah tapi ustazah siapa masniah tak salah
ah dia kata dengan aku apa kalau awak nak retake awak kena ambil fully dengan arab arab sekali semua aku macam eh serious ah ustazah
aku ah aku dah penat aku nak O level jer tau
previous seniors ah like they retake tapi they are exempted from
which what I thought it would be cause kakak aku macam gitu
tapi aku kena ambil everything then aku bingit siol
ah kakak aku retake
oh siap eh
jap eh
sebab dia macam ada good and bad tau if like your your current self go back to the old times like ada good and bad
oh my god don't forget her benci though
aiya I still cannot forget you know aku tengah copying notes down and she was talking I don't know about what uh shakespeare
aku tak ingat ah but
kelakar gila ah sebab I my meja is the only one that is extended out so literally I'm in the middle of nowhere and like she's doing it in front of me I was like
yo how how does it feel when you just broke up and then like eh kau tahu dia macam gini kat aku kat aku macam ya allah
sec two sec three ah but like after dia ni pe
kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit lah
like clearly everyone the whole school is talking about you you know like eh sudah lah I don't have time for all of you
eh tak cause okay cause my relationship was low-key relationship kan of course ah I don't want to expelled what
no maksud aku at that moment
that's different maksud aku low-key is like
ya okay maksud aku low-key kan that time was like cikgu-cikgu tak tahu part ni tak keluar tak heboh-heboh
so actually tak ramai orang tahu that I was in a relationship with him we study ah whenever we sit in the circle you know ah our our own things sit in circle then talk about then like eh amin like shafwa is it amin like shafwa right eh but I know shafwa like amin ah they always go out together aku dah macam
camne nak cakap eh aku jer asyik put in effort ah for me lah that's what I see ah don't know about him maybe he said like I put in effort too then macam ya lah
sebab tu buat aku penat ah
so okay pada aku really shafwa is just the reason
kau world ah
oh just like that guy siapa eh
ya at that time kau pun macam ah
was it the apa
yang is guy
pengotor seh
macam mana dia nak lupakan kau the girl that was dragged
eh aku nak takoyaki nya where to get ah oh my god so tempted
one satu satu for six dollars
berapa the twenty four dollars plus kan
oo tu aku one seating habis kan
eh jangan ah macam ni tak baik seh
eh aku nak try ni ah yang apa Boms and Buns eh
ya ya ya it's just few shops away from Chulop jer sebab dorang tak dapat beli shop tepi
tu lah aku tengah fikir
eh lepas kita pergi Boms and Buns we can go Spize makan wah aku dah lama tak pergi jalan
when was that bro that's not in bedok actually dekat somewhere else
it's dekat ah lain punya branch eh not bedok
I mean same company ah but different cook what bodoh
I never tadi aku makan ayam masak merah seh like I only eat a little
okay but then kan aku ingatkan aku makan sikit cause I want to buy that that chicken kan but then when
okay wait I finish I wash all my plates already then I open foodpanda just now ah I was I was looking at GrabFood and foodpanda tu then like whoa eighteen dollars
ah ya ya ya you can't deny that it's pedas
entah eh
maybe the chili dah absorb or something no
apa the noodle
tadi um lepas kau balik kerja kau buat apa kat rumah
oh my what
eh enam dah tutup
um tadi habis kerja today's half day
so quite lepak lah
penat gila eh
kerja on saturday
um but I didn't eat the whole day lah I don't know why maybe tak ada appetite balik terus tidur
ya ada lah tapi macam ngantuk sikit you know like you know they always say when you sleep too much
um you'll you'll be even more tired so macam power nap actually the minimum
the maximum kalau the best ah
um and eh nak join tak muay thai gym together
everyday you pergi
no limitation and there's going to be like macam coach
um they are gonna be there macam ada certain slots certain coaches ah
tak tu tu lah soalan cepumas dia saya tak tahu boleh ke tak tapi kita cuba kita tak tahu
if you know how to might manage your time macam okay one day badminton then one day
gini but evolve is just
I usually run um macam about
kind of everyday but just like weekends kadang-kadang macam rest penat sangat kan
two K two K plus pun jadi seh
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know dekat um
kasi lah you know chance sikit kan tutup mata satu kan and just orh come
without any experiences in training will be provided kan boleh pe and
training apa internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much ah honestly
kan susah nak dapat company yang you know really
like baca buku about homework
so like you're contradicting yourself macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa but then
there was oh kena buat assessments lah apa lah
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused yang budak-budak ni kesian kan dah balik sekolah penat
talk at all you masuk bilik
start belajar
and tak boleh baca buku
sampai habis assessment book
for their well-being macam okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them macam shelter but
okay lah kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu
nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh tau
kalau rest pun ten minute
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high ah maybe because of that you know kids complain macam eh penat you know I don't want to go student care anymore
quitting lah actually like one month macam about seven
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit macam you know sit like
they fold their legs fold pun tak boleh
yes they have to sit macam you know upright sit properly
you know our own choices macam budak-budak ni like kesian kan semua benda kena
so dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know you know
she dah dah dah dah dah ada suami so lupa lah
tak telephone tak apa
dapat and okay kahwin and like
dan you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
jodoh semua ni susah lah I mean like but
the day I get to eat some nasi biryani
nasi minyak please come on bila ni
macam like I don't know I I will learn from it lah
macam they will get like a set of rules
macam it's kind of unfair
macam takut tau okay you know like they say macam when you
when you buy buang air kecil kan then like there's ends
how to say macam
in my family punya history
ada okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my grandpa macam semua ada this history of
don't you takut seh say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
takut lah I mean like I have to take care of my diet lah
so I am like oh okay jap white bread is high
okay macam
insulin tak pakai banyak even insulin is working perfectly
that's the thing kuah lemak apa ah cholesterol oh my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
dekat kedai ada ke jual salad like hawker centre
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce kita beli like ten dollar but then
that's true beli like banyak then after that simpan in the fridge
this is the thing ah macam
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition nak physically active lah abeh busy lah dengan kerja
nutritionist exist to macam lead them
itu semua pakai duit seh do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
err love pun susah dapat like
that's true and parents nowadays also working abeh balik dah tidur you know that kind of thing
and ya lah it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend gi mana
we lepak dengan kawan but I mean it's not wrong but okay lah macam
ada balance lah okay one day with your parents one day oh I've heard of this story before satu okay there's this one um student right
um makcik tinggalkan
ah abandoned him dekat bus stop dekat malaysia
ah dia tinggalkan ah dia letak bag suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa ah
cakap um bapa nak balik you know that kind of thing and the son also tak cari bapa dia for one month
and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home
ya that's true macam you know
maybe the financially dorang tak boleh handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays banyak macam drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in macam oh ni ya allah tak baik seh
the kids now the kids ada sekarang trauma issues
ya lah they've taken care of me well apa kecil-kecil kasi makan this a way for us to repay back
that's true macam it it
um doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia punya chances
um lepak or relaxing at her old age
bosan seh duduk dekat rumah you know like the whole thing like
I don't know macam singapore
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only ni semua nak merebut lah but then
you know if you really want to chill chill mango pergi dekat paris
just duduk minum kopi and you
ada pros and cons juga fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent macam economy wah jangan cakap ah
lepak sikit lah
you know the population pun sekarang macam a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
I mean rezeki tu okay lah there's rezeki tu datang dari very you know
makan pun berapa dah berapa dollar okay nak beli pampers nak beli ini and
to me macam house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid lah I've never been living with a maid before macam sedap kan ada orang kemaskan you and all that
go macam okay err go with the flow macam go with the flow sangat you know
okay to me macam one year gap is quite productive leh like you just take one year to just
momentum dah hilang tau hilang graduate
abeh dah tak belajar eh
macam shiok dah naik shiok
so macam if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
may I I graduated kirakan macam april lah eh dah habiskan
till november terus start kerja
so better lah aim for it and there's a lot of my friends yang
the punya
so minor I mean you can minor in apa organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
oh betul betul betul
I mean depends ah on the situation kalau nak job hop just because oh you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not macam you're still young you need to know what you really want in life kalau tak experience macam mana seh
progress betul-betul macam you know be successful
oh my god that is ridiculous okay merepek gila
macam we are barely okay
like with so many macam experience and really capable
takkan nak sama okay over generous everyone as the same
don't over expect too much and also don't macam
you know like letak kita kat bawah sangat you know macam
dorang macam eh korang ni tak ada apa-apa ah just nothing you know
middle lah macam
that's true macam like
I always watch like movies you know macam
and macam susah lah dapat
macam america ni semua
sometimes I do have thoughts macam if we want to be like
apa ni is stranger things
a decent self control punya tolerance but me
like once I'm indulge into that kan habis
it's over for me so I tend I tend to macam you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like muay thai gym
for I usually waste money on play nation ni semua
tapi waste of money lah so I stop playing games
switch is simple kau macam you can bring it around pastu boleh main
baju ni semua but I'm trying my best not to
I see eh wait where does he where macam mana dia invest
tak sikit kan that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just kasi macam hundred seventy gitu
and for fifteen years ah then macam ada you will get back like a lump sum
um and in case if you were to macam touch wood lah macam pass away or anything like
how to get ah macam
you know these thing which are the backup plan gitu
what do you mean by anak luar nikah
oh tak tak tak macam serious macam in love gitu abeh uh dorang macam eh aku nak kahwin ngan kau ah because like I know I feel like I'm ready for this marriage abeh like um you know the
the parents macam oh you too young you know why why you want to get married so young you know and then they are like no I want to get married now now now what do you think
haram lah like that
okay so it's like err kes macam err okay scenario ah it's like err
they halalkan like that ah
macam apa mm macam nak date other chicks or what
I think I think by the fourth year ah aku dah settle down sia aku dah macam damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me ah by the third or fourth year ah it will give me like a sense of macam
ah that's the thing lah because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling abeh tak stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot kita masih takde
like tak ready because of money ya
tu lah
tapi honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like err
they don't want both of us to macam sekolah halfway sekolah halfway then after that err drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support ah to support each other or like err
I don't want to commit anymore sins eh and it's not that err macam bukan aku yang tanggung fully tau is like my parents around who has to tanggung for my sins also so it's like aiya I don't know lah susah I don't mind getting married now
macam I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
err friends yang macam ah don't want ah I I need money I need money like err aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup and I'm like but money is not everything what you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know ah macam entah
macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur ah
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal tak takde orang yang macam marah marah you know kat singapore macam
semua orang nak boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport semua orang macam oh alamak aku kena masuk
entah when I was still
correct eh okay lah jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small ambil macam the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular apa the population ah yes is so dense and like there's this
actually a lot of people want to err masuk singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and kita macam number one tau tip top tau
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that bila spain kena dia cepat cepat balik ke singapore
macam kalau kau sakit ke apa kan ada disease siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang singapore singapore can like handle it you know
donation like that okay and then like err a lot of children from asia kind of thing dorang macam err
suburbs is like farm area macam all the rural ah ah ah like rural area like people
I remember dekat punggol macam everything must empty takde barang you know there was a a lot of land yang kita boleh pakai
and then kita macam
you know last time I err we go pancing tau
pancing dekat macam illegal places
eh aku pancing lah
err how to say ah macam hutan-hutan oh begitu kita pergi kita drive dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah random
serious tak joke ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni confirm dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik confirm tahu punya
so err I think kita pancing ah but then after that I think the government know about it lah so no choice right err they I think they close macam a lot of the places ah and then err kita the only place kita boleh pergi is
flats because population kita kan makin besar
kita ah foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then err apa singapore pun is a district for business tau kau tahu like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground macam
si kim jong-un datang kat singapore dengan si donald tu kan dorang datang ke sini cause we are neutral
ah aku ingat aku ingat the apa banyak macam sibuk kat shangri-la tapi semua orang macam ee I want to see liao ah that kind of thing
eh singapore ambil kesempatan eh but it's good err apanya rasa publicity
ya it was good publicity for us ya sebab wah terus semua orang macam wah tengok oi singapore lawanya shangri-la wah macam semua nak pergi kan
tapi err I err aku rasa ramai orang ada misconception especially after rich crazy apa
eh I think after that that one right so many people macam got to know about singapore kan because they mentioned in singapore banyak kali tu
but the funny thing was apparently there are rumours yang cakap rumah tu bukan kat singapore
rumah tu some of it was filmed in malaysia
okay aku tak pernah tengok sorry ah

I don't know I felt like it was just too hard cam am I right macam and it's

I mean like it's okay what I just because I also don't have any interest right in this movie sorry sorry apa
okay maju cari online ah
macam okay they needed this staff to jaga the cinema halls and they needed this staff to save entry then they needed counter staff
but now they change seh they change to err counter err satu orang so the counter will take all your orders macam kau nak tiket ni you want some drinks okay uh when you pay already there's this like queueing system macam McDonald's

ya sia eh speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught lagi like
but ya lah I I think you brought up a good point seh like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle yang tak take so much of your time ah then maybe can ah
macam what
like eh walao I'll be angry seh if I have no social life boleh mati sia
oi susah sia
okay the time or money eh okay kalau if let's say I am married lah
ah that's why that's why I say money is tak not so bad ah it can be a choice ah
I think being in singapore macam very I think just singapore lah ya
keeping it to macam singapore punya contexts ah
oh tu lagi ugh
although I have to say that macam uh
like that one that one can say that the government is trying to improve because err there are more ministers talking about it and macam a lot of people are more open to listening and like they don't just macam categorising as orang gila you know that kind of thing
that one rabak seh semua orang macam ah ni confirm stress jer
tak mau sensitive seh ya tapi ya lah err I think it's
have you heard of this macam disorder called multiple multiple
apa I forgot ah split personality gitu macam
gitu split is the one ya kau pernah dengar
aku pun tak tahu sia
uh okay I had actually aku tengok this YouTube video tau err this this there's this girl lah aku tak tahu ah
err then dia macam tunjuk tau macam mana dia punya
disorder macam dia punya err how like she just teach more about her itu [ah] her her macam mental health I guess
you know it's not mental health is just the disorder lah eh dia punya diagnosis ya
and then dia tunjuk tau macam mana like she changes from one person to another person that kind of thing
wow I didn't know such like wah seriously macam ee aku tak pernah nampak sial gini ya because of internet ah ya basically things from the internet eh macam exposure seh
ah ah macam recommended
yes that's the okay honestly when aku first heard of it eh I was like
what ya ya eh apa sial this is this seriously macam for real I've never heard of this sia
and I was so shocked by the err apa personalities that was in that girl you know
okay dengarnya ni alters
ya tak betul not not really tak betul but macam split kan macam banyak power
okay they will get strong tiba-tiba all that right
ah tapi tapi dia ceritakan as much as it is an exposure to this disorder it also portrays a little bit uh macam fictional of the disorder macam bilik
so ya you should watch it you know ah that girl I forget I know her YouTube is dissociate did or something like that kau tahu anthony padilla the YouTuber
anthony padilla ada ah kat YouTube ah then he he did that the interview
ya then uh he interview ah the girl then the girl show got this budak kecil inside her body eh ya then budak tu kecil tu keluar tau
as each alter has their own um role macam there's the protector
ah there's the protector there's a apa mediator there's the child and all that so
aku tak tengok movie dia actually
tapi aku tahu pasal movie dia
macam err like like those scars lah like that
macam superhero right right right they had a motive right together
uh I feel like uh apa ni the movie is good exposure lah
eh I mean is rare to to see all these kind of people like I've never met somebody in singapore ah actually tak pernah aku nampak dorang macam begini ya
mm three wishes eh okay firstly I rasa I nak jadi billionaire
jadi billionaire I feel secure
can actually solve a lot of problem macam if like in case of emergencies like
macam accident ke apa I have the money already
I can like feel rich you know like macam jalan sana jalan sini eh I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
so I want my own transport and rumah
so like what you asked right I rasa transport I nak motor ke kereta ke
I nak my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
tak payah nak tunggu flights pun
like I want to go here and there I can macam eh sembarang eh aku nak flight okay aku naik aku punya private jet that kind of thing
like also kan macam bawa orang lah like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam you know sekarang kita nak naik plane pun nak kena bayar for the air ticket right
have the private jet why not I just macam families let's go like I can
I can payung you guys for
transportation ah eh tapi duit belanja tak
I want to conquer a lot of language so macam
ada skill like that kan
like what's you skill oh I can speak a lot of language gitu macam but I want to speak like the common one lah macam mandarin uh korean it's like
common sekarang then
kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam nice right like
since it's a wish right dia macam bukan macam magic gitu kan kalau magic gitu kan
eh sudah aku nak letak magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need lah tak payah
you know about yang seratus dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
or like amusement park ah all that ada tourism
you want to picnic ke nak overnight
rather than macam
kalau dia dua ratus lebih then
you can only use your your own only kan abeh bayar seratus lebih gila
maybe we can picnic ke apa right what you said picnic then kalau kita picnic pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak
macam hotel then chalet ke apa kan untuk staycation gitu kan mm actually not bad ah I think the idea is not bad abeh kita boleh barbecue lagi kan kalau kalau kita macam
chalet ke ah kalau macam chalet tu boleh barbecue pe
and then macam rumah okay rumah maybe like macam if it's like four hundred we can just
so it's like satu orang like berapa berapa puluh dollar gitu or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars gitu
untuk makan dengan minum okay ah nice then we can just cook or we can like macam chalet or what we tempat dia boleh masak kan so
we can just buy our groceries ke apa
then we macam simpan dalam fridge then esok tu breakfast boleh masak
semua then
I think by lunch gitu we need to
because right takkan kita nak buat macam so called birthday party tak ada decoration ke apa kan
I mean we can buy macam dekat daiso ke apa kan so dua dollar dua dollar murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat neighbourhood kind of shop kan
so I'm not sure if kalau mm but it's a nice idea lah to macam
buat both
because we can macam save up a bit of money rather than macam
satu birthday party lepas tu birthday party lagi habis duit then
tu confirm confirm kena bayar lagi eh service tu
nice but I don't think macam I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own macam
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation macam like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
we should use chalet or something rather than that because macam
kalau ada rules or regulations susah ah kita pun nak buat macam we want to save
cause sekali tak save eh uh government pula
ah ya lah like some agency datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih eh
err macam
ada rooftop like that ah
not not really rooftop dia macam not rooftop or shelter tapi macam indoor sikit
ah we can we can find the place around there so kalau hujan ke apa kan kita tak kena
because marina west coast east coast tu semua is all
so kalau hujan ke apa we still boleh lepak depan situ
for a picnic with my friends we actually macam
abeh okay maybe kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita pack up sudah hujan lebat kan
because it's like alah sikit-sikit jer point point point
gitu jer kan
I mean we got the what is called ah yang besar tu parasol eh
ah yang payung besar tu
we brought that also so kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ we letak so
ah macam ada what is it macam terpercik eh is it terpercik macam hujan kena
if we macam takut hujan splash on us then we put the uh the payung besar
mm even though we under the macam cover kan but still lah we just
kita tak kena ah pasal kita letak payung besar tu
macam glamping is it dia macam wait ah
I don't think dia orang akan macam
err kau nak stay pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu I don't think
I think that's good though but rather than macam we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
err take macam morning like that no we should like macam petang petang gitu
we should rent from petang petang
sampai ke malam like that so sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu ya we should rent that kind
so that macam
but I I don't know kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu skate macam you don't know how to skate kan
abeh kalau aku roller blade sorang eh sedih sia aku orang semua cycle cycle cycle aku eh roller blade dengan aku
oh I remember that time my eh my cousin our cousin our cousin said nak pergi zoo
merepek pergi zoo pergi zoo tengok binatang jer
both of us we don't really like animals macam hey kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok jer binatang tu
maybe aku tak appreciate ah but
I seriously want that instead of macam pergi to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
gila I will just research about it later lepas tu nanti kita tengok
cause I felt like kita macam tak spend banyak time
yang macam cousins we don't really have much
I'm like I'm schooling all that macam all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to macam jalan-jalan together
we can actually macam save up a bit of money ke apa eh lepas tu pergi shopping ke
macam nice right
ya tak berapa lama kita plan eh picnic pe picnic engkau dah dua tiga tahun
I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
I mean I'm okay with it cause it looks it looks nice the one I just googled just now it looks really nice and I felt like macam
eh macam best jer tempat ah gitu
if I'm not wrong kallang ada
mm tempat stadium tu
I mean kalau hujan ke apa kau tetap boleh climb apa
sama lah aku goal tahun ni
nak healthy lifestyle
healthy ke benda jogging tidak malam siap kerja makan
oh but talking about tu you know just now eh just now mampus you know that time
I wanted to try dia punya rock climbing
cause I rasa macam eh long time seh tak rock climbing why not eh
malu ah kalau jatuh ke apa eh orang keliling nampak dah lah rock climbing dia dekat tengah-tengah dunia gitu eh
embarrassment lah lol kat kallang wave tu kan
we can also macam watch movie also dengan dia orang
eh do you do you think the one that you suggest ada ke apa boleh kita tengok cerita lepas tu
makan makan berbual berbual lepas tu lepak-lepak eh
tak payah ah buang duit ah
I thought this one dia orang dah sediakan tempat tak ke
they sediakan already right they they have their own designated punya tempat pe
so I cakap lepas tu kan like what you say lepas tu kita cycle kan so pagi-pagi boleh cycle pe
dah cycle kita pergi mcdonald's ke
ha gitu kita pergi makan breakfast because we only bring makan untuk dinner dengan yang so called small celebration tu
then morning cycle cycle tu semua beli makan breakfast tu semua then after that
if they want to play at the seawater suka hati ah kan
I thought of like I don't know if I should bring my guitar or not but then macam
chey minah melayu sangat ni if I bring guitar and then
and then you play guitar macam eh macam dalam drama eh
but nice and then we can like macam take video photos
it's either kita macam nak balik rumah ke kita macam nak continue to other place ke apa not bad ah
tak payah nasi ah merepek picnic picnic nasi nonsense
no lah but since it's picnic I already know lah takkan I nak tu buang ni
nice if kita since kita nak buat macam birthday party celebration that kind kan
we could have just bihun goreng and nasi goreng eh sedap
is it kita nak potluck gitu
kita bawa makan dia orang bawa air ah kita suruh cousin kita bawa air
ice since dia orang nearer ask them to buy ice cube also ah
huh cucuk what
gila kalau semua benda kita dua jer yang buat
ya that's why I say dengan kita dua nak buat macam macam jangan buat kelakar
you know you talk about macam letak dekat skewer gitu kan
instead of letak kat skewer tu kan then we can just buy you know yang macam selalu orang barbecue ke
orang birthday party ke apa yang besar tu
ah so we put everything kat situ
ya lah so mi dengan nasi letak dekat situ tapi yang macam nugget ke ayam ke crabstick cuma
tak payah letak belakang lah
but I think we can do macam benda lain I mean
I I thought of like macam
buat roti sandwich or
or apa eh tu nama
I mean you say macam tak nak everything fried fried what then macam tu semua I mean it's easy to do but
whatever lah I mean tengok jer lah if if I feel like doing it ya I will do it
mm actually okay ah boleh ah one one dish jer ah lepas tu kita buat yang you know
uh we buy it's either we buy or we just find yang besar gila punya tupperware tu kita buat yang
buat satu jer lah tak payah buat dua gila kata
goreng goreng ni sambal goreng pula lagi tak payah lah
boleh boleh actually not bad can
air I think air
we are going to like have birthday celebration ni semua from
today to the next day what so of course kita perlu air pe
now like that I want like macam then we half half ah macam one is the normal drinks then uh macam
half is normal drink half is err carbonated one so macam sedap ada orang nak ada air sedap
oren oren carbonated
ya because he say it's better to just buy there lepas tu pergi pe pasal murah pe belakang
boleh lah beli a bit of chips chips yang kita nak okay maybe the chips that they buy is not the one that we want or we can just discuss what kind of chips that we want ah
but then even after we discussing obviously we need to buy the one that macam semua makan pe
so macam if you like macam like me
I sometimes feel macam oh without this I cannot sia I need this snack ah macam gitu eh
so so so I think that one nak kena beli sendiri ah
then mi oh I think oh ya I think we also need to ask
I don't know mi hoon goreng ke
mi goreng kuning ke okay ah anything can
I thought you cooking the nasi goreng
nasi goreng cina sedap eh
you masak nasi goreng cina tapi you campak ikan bilis
I help you potong ayam
okay lah boleh boleh ask your husband lah
dua packet untuk ramai orang memang tak cukup
tapi kalau kau letak sayur macam dia dah macam-macam pinggan like that what macam bowl
okay then like that takpe kita suruh dia orang buat sandwich tapi dia macam gini
lepas tu uh the tuna
ya ya what I mean dia punya roti
roti dia kalau ada crust suruh dia orang potong crust dia
lepas tu crust dia we put inside one of the plastic and then kita boleh buat
roti gula ke apa with the crust
the crust is very easy to do what setakat
crust tu kita setakat uh letak
so that it's easier so and then you can uh apa tu masuk dalam air fryer
masuk dalam air fryer lepas tu you jadikan macam snack keras keras sikit gitu
then you can just make roti snack or you don't need to
uh apa tu you don't need to air fryer or what
ya I like mushroom ball so we buy mushroom ball and instead of fishball and then nugget dengan fried chicken right
terlebih fries nanti soggy
okay ah I think we cun cun nice already ah everything we plan is nice already so I think we can tell them
instead of the one that we want to staycation tak payah lah buang duit lah
kalau kalau glamping tu mahal sangat
kita lepak kat tepi beach tu jer
letak mat kat situ ah lepak jer kat tepi okay ah
nice plan we both of us plan is like cun already
we want to go out picnic we tell them already what so but then kita kata maybe kita should go next year
during kak nadiah punya birthday dengan sambung together with abang punya birthday
we just said that but we never say about macam kita punya surprise birthday party what so okay ah dia orang pun tak tahu
they need because I think like macam whatever they like ah or need
cause I feel macam
okay lah then that one we can bring dia punya husband or something you know or someone else or adik dia
we can bring to buy to pillih dia punya dress ke apa because
kita punya taste tak ada lah sama sangat
oh ya so I don't know if we should buy denim sebab denim mahal
so tak tahu ah kalau kita nak beli denim beli denim kalau nak beli dress beli dress
colour code untuk kita waktu kita pergi picnic yes
since kita
since kita pun nak overnight right so kita colour code dua hari ah
but tak nak black ah common
I want red actually but I felt like kalau hujan macam mana
petir guruh ke apa ow aku takut
takpe ah suruh dia pakai baju kat dalam lepas tu yang tu tak payah butang
tu I don't know ah but we can just discuss with them later since we already discuss everything
so the colour coding later we can just ask kau orang ada colour apa kita ada colour apa ah
okay so I she's going away we're going to get her a present ah and ya I think you're right the frames are too heavy we're not going to give those but how I don't want it to be like macam buku yang just print out like that biarkan gitu then it's just gonna sit in a cupboard forever I feel like it will be cool if it was something that she
can see everyday you know especially in that country maybe lots of pictures of us in the sunshine macam while she freezing her butt off there
yes yes yes yes ya ya ya so it's not just err err apa tu what we going to make
err phone phone case it can be anything it can be a mug it can be a t-shirt boleh apa-apa kan
but no you want a gift that can on that day itself be looked at right okay okay fine ya ya then I think ya we can find some small light items nak buat dia punya print ah so we're gotta select a bunch of pictures of what we like right and then
figure out what are the things I'm sure they have online presence mesti ada kalau kau pergi dia punya website dia cakap that these are the things you can bring on or something ah or if not actually there are a lot of websites that do that so macam vista print
cause they are that kind of digital printers so they do everything so okay so let's pick out a bunch of pictures kita pilih mana yang kita suka then that becomes the photo book and then we pick out a few others ya okay can ah I guess that is the plan
aku tak ada tak ada bilik tau bilik aku is my sister you know so cause I was living elsewhere so my things were always a minimum ah and then both times when I go government staycation also
again I lost a lot of things so my whole life has been a series of losing shit lah moving and macam just all over the place so when it meant that when I moved into this house I just didn't have
why can't it not be us apa jer okay so how about we make a poster ah of us
when forever in your heart you know sort of vibes ah ya ya it's ultimate narcissism for a group that is so in love with ourselves gitu
what is the deal dia secretive gila ah sia aku tak tahu dia sekarang at which point you know are their tickets booked is that is what is happening over there you know
sharing about it like that time I I thought her her attitude was interesting like she was dia cakap that um
she don't want to talk about it to people cause she's afraid to like jinx it gitu and then she would also feel very embarrassed if she was supposed to leave on a certain date and then didn't then people will like macam
eh nisa why you never leave eh kau apa sia I'm like can't imagine who the who the hell would actually do that to her
tak aku rasa it is that ya ya ya when it comes to him you're right they got some secretive things aku aku rasa that dia cakap dengan nisa that these things kau tak payah share dengan kau punya friends I think so too I think that is that sort of understanding between them which
ya lah it's their partners lah we should respect that ah but I just thought there was some fear there you know of people mocking her and I'm like um you a bit too old to have this fear tapi dia kadang-kadang got got that kind of little streaks of like
how to be her own person ah like she will stand up to people and she will I liked it when I see her at parties and she very mother hen with all the younger ones I think it allows her to make a lot of friends cause she goes in like a kakak kakak you know she goes in like
ah kau dah okay tak and then aku boleh cakap dengan kau gini gini gitu gitu like like she's just how are you macam mana sekarang sekolah gitu gini you know and ya
ya I I don't understand what it could take macam ah ya unless somebody changes drastically and that could happened sometimes somebody becomes bitter or alcoholic you get what I mean ah then you become a bit wonky ah
ya both both both to tini okay got it okay so she felt like somehow you macam take tini
together apa kau orang semua sama-sama tu ah
so abeh at that point kau tak cakap apa-apa dengan dia
abeh kau tak terasa nak cakap apa-apa dengan dia cause kau dah tahu kan ah
ah dengan tini
siapa jas dengan tini asal eh dia orang macam
so hari tu bila kita dah sampai dekat pizza cause again I'm lost in my own world did they have a chat outside dia orang berbual
ya ya ya ya ya ya unless you're coming to eat with us then okay lah it's clear tapi kau
iya lah like like like you like to
ya okay okay okay ya ya ya nobody really likes that anyway ya ya ya yup ya ya ya I understand tahu
jadi kau bila kau berbual dengan sarah kau adalah explain dengan dia that the reason why that even came up in the first place was pasal kau nak understand make tini understand that she's being played ah
did did we post that picture in the group chat with dengan dia punya cake nama dia tu ah K K
tahu tahu tahu ya ya ya ya kau percayalah ya I know I know I know I know I know I know ya
ah correct correct it's new information for someone you know as opposed to macam mengeluh over somebody usual pattern tu lain
ya tak tahu seh cerita cerita ni semuanya
ya tu lah tu lah
then I also wonder oh is it because we just don't say these things kita mana nak belajar pasal boundary and learn how to do it
ah ah correct aku rasa macam
tu lah tu lah kami datang nak petik bunga di taman awak
ya it's the bahasa berbunga and the gentleness of the language overall lah ya ya ya makes it hard
I bet you would have kau mesti ketawa macam perempuan gila in the corner and make it a lot worse than it is nanti dia fikir aku betul-betul suan dia
confirm tau kau punya sense of humour kadang-kadang like no janganlah
ah so azmi tahu ah hari ini kau datang sini buat ni ah kau cakap dengan dia
kita tengah we are currently in about let me see twenty seven minutes we are about halfway through ah azmi can you entertain yourself
ya I did say no background noise but that was just a really quick one kami minta maaf iya
ah or maybe I do I don't know I have to go in and check that might be some ground ginger from my mum she likes this she gives me ground ginger so I could mix it with some hot water and and something okay I'll go look at it after this actually I'm getting damn hungry so after this I do aku nak pergi makan
aku nak makan mak aku punya briyani tak kisah pergi mampus dengan perut aku and come and taste some a bit sedap makan dia dengan curry all these
mak aku masak two days ago national day feasts
ah tu ah tu pun ada I didn't even know we had this tradition tapi tak pasal-pasal ah hari ni national day kita ada briyani abeh aku is not not having it so that day I was out at brunch then after brunch went over to to aman friends place right so I was
ya do you know there was my national day was so non eventful on my way to brunch which I had with a friend dekat at kat upper thomson aku pass by dekat road aku nampak banyak-banyak orang semua diri dekat luar road
then aku thought they were going somewhere but no cause it's this mobile columns that's moving right so that's why I did not know about this mobile columns at all so I was like why are they just standing there kalau kau nak pergi somewhere jalan ah asal diri sana panas terik tu hari tu aku dengar forty one degrees
apa ni you're supposed to kill people that's what the war machine is for right but ah no but apart from that I had no idea it was national day I didn't even hear fireworks can you see from here
jadi sekarang macam mana kau nak try tackle one of the questions
folklore and petua-petua kesihatan you get what I mean for like different ah different food items whether it's different types of herbs different types of leaves different types of yams whatever from indonesia
the waiter comes out and the presentation is beautiful the way he like opens up the kau tahu macam bunga-bunga apa tu eh bunga ulam eh or is it the bunga-bunga macam
look like banana flower kind of vibe ah or top ginger you know that kind where you sort of peel it open kan ah lepas tu the way yang dia orang serve and like plate the thing and then telling the explanation of what it's for and how do people use it are there any stories associated with it I thought that was a really memorable meal cause everything that you taste suddenly had a lot of significance and I'm sure we all had meals like that and I think whenever somebody plans meal kan
ah tu
bila larut malam punya vibes ah
ya ya ya actually I don't even know about I feel like I've got aku pernah dengar nama dia saffron tapi aku tak tahu kat mana dia kat bugis
where is it tampines ah okay okay okay ya lah maybe that's why aku tak travel out lah
it's very random and it goes straight to tampines I don't even know why normally the road ni kira ada feeder bus jer biasanya tapi sekarang ada one two seven apa benda
and I've been seeing a lot more of this large bright green buses punya bus baru punya ah ah dia orang macam tak tahu ni bus baru ke service baru but
ah new buses lah right that they bought ya ya ya ya so from tadi yang aku faham bus ni kalau kalau kalau kau ambil bus ni dia terus pergi highway
do not pass do not collect two hundred dollars dia terus pergi highway lepas tu kau end up in tampines in berapa minute okay lah not minute lah but iya lah you get the idea ya ya very short ah
but they take awhile they all take awhile they will go and explore kat mana kita pergi tengok-tengok err geylang mari lah kita boleh tengok katong
mm katong ya there's a lot of ah detours ah tak faham seh
ah ask bird park pun bird park aku sakit hati aku ambil bus pergi sana one and half hour sia
pantat kering ah that I basically aku need to sampai boon lay
ah bird park kau kau cakap apa zoo eh
dia orang masih tak email aku sia after aku hantar resume aku about that was I think on the seventh
dia dia cakap they didn't basically dia macam portal gitu kau upload upload resume apa benda then at the end it just had a your resume has been successfully submitted ah ah kau tunggu three weeks
then the meantime there are other things like my I have a friend who call me and it's basically what this is is a startup habis startup ni dia macam kumpul together all the plumbers electricians sort of thing okay then you would it works like a uber where you would find a service and book it and then abeh kau kau boleh tengok dia punya err err route to you ah macam macam macam grab delivery ah boleh nampak dia punya driver on the way to you how long more it will take blah blah blah
and then ah they need somebody to help coordinate this things in the back end and also err check out on the services that is provided tanya lah dengan orang tu okay okay tak dia orang buat ada apa-apa rosak ada apa-apa okay complain ke apa benda um
so that's that the job seems rather interesting tapi I'm I'm a little concerned about it on a couple of levels ah firstly dia startup abeh baru start apa apa cerita dia sebenarnya you know like what is the process and is it kau orang ada macam any or template in place or actually kau orang tengah cari orang untuk start the whole thing up you know from scratch properly cause if that's the case ya okay I I also don't have problem with that but I would need to make sure that I'm paid
there are already a lot of websites where you can even like directories and you can kau boleh filter down tau kau tinggal kat mana orang ni kat mana ah that kind of thing it's not something new ah this
pulling together of different house jobs you know plumbing ah carpentry little bit that sort of thing it really exists a lot jadi aku macam err apa seh
nak try ke tak
abeh in the meantime ada benda macam gini okay aku happy nak buat I don't know why sia I don't know ah I'm feeling macam don't want to work and then also the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and there's all this weirdness and more jobs to be lost and the economy is going to shit
it's not a way of avoiding the world it's just aku don't feel like dealing with you all right now it's too much crap I don't feel like it I'm not having it
leave ah I learn this new word vibing I'm just vibing man so kira macam tangkap jer ah vibing so I vibe ah
ah ah ah betul
betul betul betul and just live a simple basic life for awhile right ya
ya ya I would get into something quite obsessively I think you know like just explore or pursue or an interest sampai
ya ya ya the whole thing is a very romance novel vibe yes ya with the hair and the jawline it's very like the guys that you find on the cover of romance novel gitu ah
tu ah abeh macam kau terasa ah kau terasa macam kau nak extra mentel gitu tak tahu dari mana punya ni ah
that's also a romance novel apa macam the rope who you tame taming the rope
pangkeng means apa eh
oh tu tu yang kau orang panggil hotel ah rumah uncle
tak tahu seh
kau kau bayangkan hidup mesti ada concept
kau bayangkan ada cakap dengan kau hidup mesti ada concept computer programme
eh kau
kira macam gang ah ah ah ah ah
alah geramnya it's like asking your parents kita sebenarnya asal dari kampung mana seh
mm mm mm mm mm budak marsiling
okay kau boleh nampak malaysia tapi sana tak ada causeway tak ada apa kan there's no bridge
toa payoh aku rasa mungkin ada port
alah sedih
aku macam >pakai file tak pakai file pun dia orang tak kisah seh
ah ah betul
I I went to this activist event ah some time ago two years ago I think it's called apa itu activist so it was mainly organized by AWARE and a lot of other like MARUAH all this ah different activists and groups here in singapore then one of it had breakup session so then you can pick
which room you want to go to participate in which session ah so I went to this one particular room where dia orang macam mana tau macam lebih kurang tiga puluh orang tiga puluh orang sit in a circle berdiri in a circle
and then berdiri in a circle lepas tu the person yang moderator diri dekat tengah dia cakap okay if you have these things that I'm about to say you step back
if you don't if you never had these things then you step forward so they started asking ah kau ada maid tak kau pernah ada maid rumah kau abeh kalau kau ada kau step back
so abeh ask more questions ah macam kau pernah ada rumah family kau ada kereta tak kau orang pernah pergi holiday kau pernah rasa macam snow basically questions about privilege ah then at the end of the thirty forty questions that he asked
kau boleh nampak ah siapa yang kat tengah siapa yang kat belakang sikit abeh yang kat tengah banyak was a lot of brown people also cause some of the questions that was asked was also macam have have anybody made fun of your name
abeh aku found myself right in the middle with two other people
I was a bit confused about being in the middle cause I thought I ada pretty good life you know ya we got no maid no car all these tapi there's always food on the table I had uniforms I've heard so many other stories of people who had it so much worse right that was interesting but then
dia semua pun ada abeh kenapa orang lain tak boleh ada ni semua kenapa hidup dia orang nak kena sampai macam gini seh
couldn't he just kept crying and crying the group macam went around him abeh sayang sayang dia and
betul betul betul aku ada terfikir tau at that moment macam eh kau yang nangis sepatutnya aku yang patut nangis apa sia kau nangis tapi aku rasa tapi aku rasa kadang-kadang
tu ah ya ya correct correct there was a sense of that there's definitely a sense of that but then there was also a sense of maybe you need to
like be far removed from the from the situation in order to sympathize with it sometimes when you are too close in the situation dia macam apa tak kisah ah buat jer ah
tapi when you are far away you realised actually this person doesn't need to do this you know this person should be able to have other options instead of being forced to towards doing X Y Z so maybe he was in the better position to to understand privilege than we do cause he's
I don't know I don't know what it is ah about us like you said maybe it's that change over from technology that's change and suddenly from a position of being macam a bit suaku about the world suddenly we see a lot more we see a lot more riches we also see a lot more pain and poverty
eh aku tak suka ah dia orang punya cerita tak habis-habis tak habis-habis pasal aku dulu ah very very poor tau aku tak ada duit family aku tak ada duit
main soccer
macam are you listening to yourself not bro
ah kau tak ada script ke ni sikit-sikit ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya and who's writing this maybe the people writing it are tone deaf in the first place you understand like aku can imagine them choosing some like rich fuck
oh this is the whampoa ya but cause kau orang punya the other side siapa lim tian
lim tian sama dengan randolf ah
randolf was volunteering with lim tian apa
it's for people who are scared lah it does need they need to be told that cause even this election banyak kali sia macam naomi had colleagues my mother had friends who all said your vote is not secret in singapore
this fear is still there ah and aku rasa the the the likes this fear to be there cause then senang apa untuk dia orang
ah kau try ah nanti aku tak kasih kau covered walkways kau nak covered walkways
but now I see my apa I was specially recognised as a top fan
it's a facebook group ya ya ya I was so proud of myself aku macam I took a screenshot and send to naomi and say my accomplishment for today everybody we must achieve something
hidup mesti ada concept
okay I'm actually very stress lah pasal the my wedding lah
that was the initial plan err tapi entah the situation can change you kno
err kalau we we I moved to his house kan at least nak pindah to our new house it's lagi dekat lah I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the barang</malay
mm then don't know lah to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house eh and then like rohana because kesian kan the the the budak macam</malay
tak kan nak share satu bilik perempuan lelaki unless they are willing to build err bunk bed lah which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed err we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed cuma share bilik saja</malay
so I thinking kalau if we move to my parents house the
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least ada bilik and the house is bigger then dia pun dia pun cakap like oh ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
ah itu dia macam takut not really takut lah like you know too dah biasa tinggal kat east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding tapi due to budget lah kan um
maybe consider to do two separate size lah so cuma no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be leceh you know because we have to tak kan I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
aiya ya just basically just a bit susah lah
yes but then tak semestinya we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider macam like like what mother cakap is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
oh that one I didn't check err because the only thing that I check was that if let's say um we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate ke tak</malay
ah because err I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong lah six months atau three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like dulu lah s
entah but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then um one thing about the the is florida kasi ready ready like err provide the flooring err basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare lah
err tapi I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply ah it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so err tak sangka that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan oh uh wedding macam mana err how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the saudara mara dah besar besar how about lik
the budak the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is satu famil
ah okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part eh for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year dah kena deposit you know o
ah okay but then I mean ya lah whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows sekarang pun is about the same tapi we do have like thoughts abou
memang okay memang we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
kita buat kat bawah block ya let's say for my side ah
I kita buat kat bawah block you have to consider that oh catering and decoration may not be under one err one company we may be separate and then err apa ni like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one err price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like macam you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
mak andam all this separate lik
for me I think like oh because kita buat combine and it is a location that can provide a lot macam for the one at orchard righ
and if you want kompang then that one is different thing lah then the only thing that I have to worry about is um the ride
uh the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because kalau boleh I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know lah my dad punya thinking i
you know that budget right make it a small nikah and then just makan makan lah after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know lah my father got problem so and lagi pun</malay
good wedding ah is really really great lah so macam entah jus
okay ah if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him lah because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the duit hantaran and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs err to ferry to each other to each side lah so at least kalau macam at one locatio
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like kalau buat two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit kan susah and then kesian the mak andam kadang kadang I'm not thinking for myself lah I am thinking for other people so y
that's why lah is really really hard for me to think about this lagi lagi two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there lah from now lah
I mean I get it lah you told me to work on it tapi the problem is I have been discussing like
parents lah all about these tapi I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
kita banyak discuss within each other its tapi entah lah when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then macam</malay
okay okay boleh okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum uh his mum atau she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least alah dah biasa makeup sendiri is best to you know biar orang kat orang makeup kan orang kan lagi pun</malay
ya the mak andam dia punya at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already lah eh the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just tutup one eye lah for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and lagi pun</malay
uh tapi kahwin sekarang
itu pun okay no doubt her big plans changed ah but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the um th
planner is helping lah so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make bawah block lah
but because now really very hard right so the err dia parents cakap okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels lah
so her concern is that eh bento box mana cukup like is a malay wedding tau you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento macam is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that lah but then because of this eh err she had actually got enough as i
ya of course lah you too just want the nikah but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see ah lagi alah I think because the his mother also macam</malay
alah mak pak dia dah tua so he she's been trying to push him to get married lah so I don't know whether that means that oh just cepat cepat kahwin then dah or just want to make it a big even
because lah ya lah like you mention that I'm still considered an uh outside outsider kan so I mean kalau boleh I don't want to masuk campur lah whatever happens because it's not my family ye
tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana I mean kalau boleh I tak nak masuk campur bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what ah sebab ini pun ya at this time pun is good lah to get married cuma</malay
definitely lah now you kan confirm ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean tak yah by choice lah but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if kata that err you want to invite a certain family member tapi sangat jauh actually like four hours is like already long lah kan
kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput kan family jauh tu jauh lah tapi tetap i
jauh in the sense of distance lah not is in terms of family tree so macam like there was one example that my friend she just got married like uh think two months ag
err)she was apologising to ah semua like ah sorry ya tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak limit kat family jer then we all macam trying to reassure lah tak apa lah kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom lah I mean no issue what tapi ya tapi you all are like my like my friends and also macam I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam kalau boleh jangan lama lama kan don't delay right but then alah since they actually tuhan dah dah tau eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind lah just get ready lah but err but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still kat rumah so limited to I think fifty person right termasuk her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like macam sedih because only family is there ah no friend so macam like entah lah I don't know lah whether she still feels bad or not uh so she's been trying to like you come lah you come over to my house lah we will have lik
makan makan session or something but then of course due to schedule lah we cannot commit to certain times right y
because we are considered err sekarang first time righ
ya like like okay lah you can like still had ya know tu I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also lah and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as dah bilang the parents then at least bila the both sides nak jumpa to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor yang for him is the duit hantaran actually until now I don't know the difference oh duit hantaran and mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's kalau macam untuk pasal wedding ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin that one is okay is i
and then for hantaran that one is considered lik
no no no not the barang hantaran but duit</malay
cheque kosong dah melampau kot actually kalau let's sa
maybe because of all these uh hantaran right I didn't actually eh one post kat Facebook um this err is like a page lah where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like macam those magazin
got married um in iBloom apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded lah drag until like baru baru juga lah and then um bagaimana tahu that the husband have a lot of hutang</malay
on top of the wedding tau because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because dah kenal lama</malay
sejak dulu so they they feel that okay lah since dah kenal lama kan and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage ah so maybe because it'
err macam it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that kan dorang kena ada hutang and then some more at the same time dorang nak dapat rumah which I don't know how lah so macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that dia macam stress like dia yang perlu kahwin tapi you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like err bukan apa ni bukan</malay
err loan daripada along lah its like those err school punya fees then dia minta bank loan for study he eh from what I read leh he the husband did investment so investment hilang duit</malay
so because dia tak boleh bayar I don't know lah all this thing I I don't understand lah so so she's like was asking pendapat lah like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so macam to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing sama kan
ah against her or citing her so those yang against her right are like macam you kno
a lot of people macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it lah
tak kisah lah sayang ke kenal lama ke because I've had err friends eh who actually tunang urgent dating lama tunang about two years tapi ended they didn't managed to go throug
wah that means either like they are not ready financially atau just dah tak ada feeling lagi lah which saya macam pelik eh like you tahan for so long as in not say tahan lah dating for so long and the bila tunang you just give up ah
ya lah a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because dia nak minta pendapat eh
correct but then entah lah I feel like but then to me kan kalau going back to my friend eh um together for seven year
and then tunang for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got dugaan when they tunang tapi I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so apa beza ya when you sarung cincin then oh suddenly all the problems come up you kno
so macam that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that oh okay ah lepas ni uh nak fikirkan tinggal mana uh nak duduk mana but it's the fact that oh it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already tapi kan the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding eh is lik
the lauk is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
err if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of lauk</malay
uh the other one is like the basic lah got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like kuih muih ah it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
he close bridal tahu then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else oh ya we can offer you th
kambing golek for about I think uh fifty people or the we'll issue uh like one thousand satay stick
uh as in uh part of the bridal right that means is uh tak salah it's two outfi
two outfit and then with mak andam everything he compared with the price of kambing and satay
who would wanted seh and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person tahu and they even dare to say you know err because you know lah perangai kita after every wedding mesti will lik
this one tahu they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event lah we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe pukul enam ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me oh
so you want to stay as long as you want tak kisah do you know padahal both of them ar
kirakan muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies lah basically so macam it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better tapi the
eh rabak army life is the most
susah susah gila ah
rabak ah no hair botak
and then like there's sikit sikit kena tekan
I got posted out tukar vocation
on steroids ah is like lagi susah

I actually like lupa
I lupa nak reply her
okay I'm going to reply her after I makan
then like after I makan I was like
tapi like I don't want then I felt like
so semalam like
I told my mum and my kakak was like
to like clean like cause apa nama dia err yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my almari from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the buku-buku
and then I shifted all the I I I simpan the book balik
and then what happened to the one keluar you know what time we keluar or not we went out like
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to beli right
I went to spotlight sebab I want to find
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to jahit for my
which tak habis-habis
ya so I was trying to find a breathable kain
main thing that I wanted to cari was the
like find the kain
turns out it was like dekat dalam
an almari
tadi tadi while while bathing I was
cik saya nak order
nak order suji boleh
tapi usually like people sell suji that
as I was saying tadi
I was trying to think macam like
err when is a good time for us to record lah cause macam
at five masih very very very memekak
crowded here and because that time masa masa we shot at kim punya place
yang we went to jewel eh I think
like all my close friends I only like keluar with the for like
like satu bulan eh no dua bulan sekali kind of thing you know
or like tiga bulan sekali
ah ya ya ya apa
give it a listen nanti lepas ni
I think the korean industry is kind of like macam
apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap eh
and it's damn big it's like besar gila and
real lah macam
pakai yang the one that I told you about hari tu that it karat
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs kan sebab it's like one for one
um when I was buying it I was like thinking kenapa dia punya
kenapa orang nak kena ada promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
oh it's a good deal cause like macam
mum and my kakak ah
patutlah dia jual one for one
sebab dia punya specs tak guna
then I was like lepas tu dia cakap eh cause like
your degree naik or something right
is it just tak masuk akal to me
then my kakak cause my kakak was telling me ah that um celebrities who
share that dia orang beli their glasses from owndays like they keep on macam promoting owndays that means like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why macam a lot of
specs shop is dekat dalam the display then you have to like engage the
is on display everything at macam the racks then you just take and tak payah
like the the shop that I went to dia
dia dia dia dia I sound like I'm singing oh my god
while waiting for them to fix my kakak punya glasses
like berani gila
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because macam
they have to let the migrant workers work sebab of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
talking about apa nama dia um
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I masuk then I was like what is all these two faced people
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced macam
macam that
but then you only do a little like sikit
but like playing with stocks are like macam gambling ah
naik or turun
my nenek sheryl was sharing with me ah that like
so my mind is literally macam peanut
macam there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some merepek content
different tiktoks everyday kan macam like it like within
nanti it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and stuff like that and and like to reach out err to a bigger audience but macam
like I masuk also to tengok what people
no I masuk to tengok like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to macam
and when guys do that is like tak ada perempuan lain ke
like as in macam
like to me right it's like tak tahu malu ke like you already like cling onto like someone
try everyone else macam
macam like common ya
they are macam
suruh dia kahwin chef ah
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan
even if they don't have like long term macam five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel macam
they should have at least like a one year plan kalau tak macam
what you menganggur
oh I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it oh serahkan pada like allah and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your usaha man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
habis nanti like if if you say that
if you tegur them about it right nanti dia orang macam
the first time apa ah

I mean at the end of day I mean ah how how much netflix can you watch right within a day I mean aku tengok netflix one one hour drama pun dah aku dah macam lethargic gila like alone like to be staying I mean right now I'm staying home lah because because of this the whole entire err situation
I mean K mine was quite interesting I mean err as you know aku kan buat caregiving job kan to my friend so err I mean yesterday I was just resting I mean the day before so of course err
um when it comes to have to my friend need um what I do normally is I go over to his place um I will like um prep him lah and keep him proper and like aku mandikan dia
uh and then dia nak berak and everything so aku dia and everything then aku nak kena siapkan dia so everything took like one hour plus and then after that
err we were waiting for transport because kawan dia nak kena hantar tau hantar dia so we were like one hour late for the appointment so we're supposed to be there by three
but we only managed to get the transport by like three forty five lah almost four lah so lambat lambat lambat gila so by the time we reached err the hospital
err hospital tu somewhere around dekat err in the east
so it was almost four so by the time kita masuk then the the therapists were saying like err one hour lambat and everything lah last standard procedure lah huh but they would just do their best lah because of this COVID nineteen kan
so okay lah I mean it it then after that aku hantar dia balik and then lepas tu bila aku hantar dia balik after that there was guest that came in so the guest happens to be err like err dia punya adik punya wife punya parents
so of course aku nak kena siapkan lah I had to like wipe him err tukar baju dia tukar t-shirt dia and everything so I had to like prep him and then he was dia pun nak makan
dia dah makan err then the the parents of err dia punya err apa tu adik dia punya wife masuk tau into the room
and then it was like so awkward ke tu orang tua aku tak tahu kenapa dengan orang tua but bila dia like when they entered the room aku dah tahu okay this is going to be a very sombre sedih atmosphere
it's kind of betul gang ah they were talking to my friend and then they started to cry aku dah macam ya alah aku cakap no don't cry and then after that the one thing that made me even macam tersentuh sikit lah bila bunyi apa tu
your phone ah kacau jer your phone oh your alarm okay tak apa tak apa so apa tu semantic noise so ah so okay back to my story so lepas tu ah then the the mother lah the mother said to me lah ah nama anak nasri ya
then like mm a'ah cik nama saya nasri dah okay I was feeding my friend right so after that the mum was like nak nak tahu kan anak suap anak suap err err kawan ni anak dapat pahala aku dah macam aku tak tahu apa nak buat do not know how to continue the convo
ya ya ya ya ya and then aku dah macam
ya ya it's true it's true and then aku macam and then err lepas tu err then the mother was like saying err um saya jaga err suami saya dia masuk hospital enam kali then I'm like eh kamu bual err personal story pula kat aku aku dah macam macam mana nak react ah so aku macam then I I try my best
a'ah I tried my best to stay composed lah then after that err aku pun dah macam alamak aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah start nangis then they started to cry aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam no no no no this this cannot dia they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am macam tak boleh I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up macam tersentuh ah and then automatically my air mata will mengalir you know so I was like then I was like quickly err err apa tu kasih suap then after that I just say uh
cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap lah so I went out of the room lah then when I went out the room
and then kau tahu apa you know my mum's friend um
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya kiranya my my friend punya mum
mother lah kirakan ah tak boleh masuk you know inside the room because you see ah
because yang sakit tu anak dia tau so bila so she is and then she's also sakit so when she will feel sedih you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition dia akan nangis
ah yes yes yes that like she feel like macam anak dia akan pergi dulu you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then aku dekat dapur and then the mum would would like tell me lah like like you know err the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say err
tu lah err takde orang lah yang dia kesian you know aku punya kawan macam dia kan sekarang pun yang jaga dia it's like the father and the maid apa the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend lah so macam so sometimes bila dia tak mampu to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first apa because the mother is the priority first apa
so you know at times kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa err dia pun sometimes will say you know like err
puas hati masukkan err dalam ni lah rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already ah and then the mother the mother say lah macam
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like macam golongan really yang orang tua lah
so sometimes bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak react with aku dah macam huh macam mana nak what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like macam err takpe lah cik sabar lah cik cik tahan jer lah
but even the the mum also say lah macam the mum somehow I can feel like the mum macam somehow appreciate aku lah macam akan cakap apa like what you tell me like err
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum macam
the mum really appreciate aku ah the mum macam sometimes I think the mum dia tersentuh lah and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon ah tak silap
because they dia dia orang orang boyan I think boyan ke jawa I think err jawa jawa sorry dia orang orang jawa
the parents are orang jawa so so so nasi rawon is like a big thing lah so I didn't come on the day she masak cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend lah like macam eh aku tak dapat datang ah tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat
so the then the mum said ah tu lah cik masak ah hari tu tapi tu lah err anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang I'm like sorry lah cik K I mean
honestly aku cakap dengan kau
aku kan nak balik kan in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
uh dia automatically dia akan sedih so aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak react then he he say to me lah like hey can you do macam online from here then I'm like huh how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia
I mean after so many years of just macam you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now macam you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time macam kita have that conversation with beberly kan
ah yang kat mcdonald's err like I was very very lost when I was like what umur aku twenty two all the way to twenty seven can you imagine I was lost for almost five years
so so that's why I was like telling myself err when when comes to to my friend lah ya aku tak boleh tolong dia all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to ulang balik come back because of the whole swab test err quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day dia dia pun nak kena redha and I aku pun cakap dengan dia lah macam
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just macam
he always dia dia selalu ingat yang
yang aku jer seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia
then aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia lah macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya cousin setakat cousin aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa
tapi dia dia macam tak lah macam macam err then dia cakap lah yang cousin aku tak take initiative and everything
mum betul betul betul
memang membastard rabak punya
ya I mean I don't know lah err I mean err if I if I want to share you personally then kau macam
err he even ni tau that he gave a certain amount of money to me tau
and the amount is one K with dia kasih aku dia jadi macam sedekah kat aku dia cakap eh err you take lah this money to pay for your semester fees as alhamdulillah but at the end of the day at the same time aku rasa macam
kau tahu macam you are tied down to something that's why aku kalau boleh tak nak macam
I don't want to accept the money lah you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because um dia dah ada ni ah you know sometimes orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat kan
so aku just accept graciously lah and aku and I I I feels that money to pay for my err semester fees err for my err semester lepas
ah ya it feels like an amanah you know so by the but aku pun rasa macam serba salah lah macam need doing kaus eh macam
then dia cakap tak apa tak apa just ambil aku macam alamak macam mana tu but but you see like see aku dah macam you see ah like my my my err university journey like a hamburger lah alhamdulillah I would say that macam err my urusan has been dipermudahkan lah
uh with regards to my semester fees I mean err I have contribution from my late my my late step grandfather my late uncle and then then dia juga ah apa tu contribute to my semester fees
ah rezeki so macam like I say lah like you are tied down to something lah so aku kalau boleh macam
ya and I like somewhat in debt but at the same time aku macam
macam this is my my share lah macam aku kalau boleh tak nak mungkir tau macam because
aku rasa unless you are dedicated to the person and then macam you if you are not dedicated to the person you would not help the person all the way to the extent lah I mean as I do not know of any other person who does the same thing as me I think I'm the only one lah as of now lah
mm betul

oh your oh macam your father is the macam very the old school punya ni eh
very dominant macam apa tu match up begitu tapi ni lelaki punya

mm faham faham faham
mm betul
eh no err not bumi err in syurga syurga

so he he I mean he's I mean not not it's not calculative it's just that he likes to compare and count like that lah in money in belanja
ah faham faham faham
ah faham faham faham
mm faham faham
err dia tak go through apa you and your uh and your other siblings went through the hardship you know nak cari makan and everything and how your mum raise you guys up and everything
eh kau nangis ke kat situ
you haven't kau takde intention nak go onto public sector ke
masuk like teaching I don't know maybe
but untuk I aku rasa macam
err the ones yang err macam study hard apostrophe
will progress kuat juga then the ones yang err tak progress are the ones yang macam mediocre
will just fought out in society aku masih ingat err I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher err he
ah now when I think about him ah when I think about that statement ah about what he made at last time ah aku macam eh you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad ah you you are that ah that
macam his statement ah macam ada sense of macam elitism you know macam macam macam how our err government ah macam gitu that kind of it's like the vibe right there the dia kasih ya
macam very similar to how the government macam how the government is like lah so aku fikir eh you mean apa yang people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are err apa tu content with what they have so
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so um so before I went there in my head I always thought macam able to kan aku nak belajar kat sana then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive lah in the beginning lah or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore kan pakai cambridge kan and sana they have their own system tau ah for apa tu macam for how to grade and grading and everything
and then kat sana aku perasan wah the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart eh we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know macam ones from sabah with the ones from johor
the ones from perak like aku dah aku I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but aku realize about them is what they lack is
they are they are very err examination based kau faham kan exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is macam hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is macam err the examination is err it's it's it's it's very straightforward ah macam uh you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like err those yang macam err critical thinker
is tak banyak tau kat sana
the ones yang critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones yang from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question yang macam critic yang macam higher thinking ah
but because our our education system is dah macam nurture us like this kan but bila when we go there dia orang think yang kita ni super on tau
so aku macam huh super on eh not really leh it's just that uh our just that our culture macam singapore culture has trained us to be like this macam and then some more you have to understand aku kat sana aku pay enam ribu eh
so every hour and every minute tu bagi aku is duit so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like macam when ah so sometimes they they the malaysian kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam
dia orang they are quite intimidated lah even my classmate also told me ah yang the very first time they met me they she feels that I am aku sombong aku arrogant aku cakap eh serious ah
she say ah engkau macam poyo ah aku dah serious ah poyo
ah poyo then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with aku I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my kepala would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior lah because you are overseas mah you're like you need to hustle apa and then then
alhamdulillah I would say that I am coping very well lah I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that aku drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second um
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself err then I was not really focused ah like I still remember like the day before the exam baru aku nak belajar can you imagine
ya yang answer script
ah it's like a macam err I based err meaning ah I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same ah like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me lah ah who has studied in
um ah in semester three I was very low key nak mampus tau aku macam aku every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet uh I even like um tak post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key ah
ya and then this coming semester four pun err aku hopefully lah I can get a err very good lah but all in all aku cakap dengan kau I mean
I don't know I don't know lah macam but but you see ah I I remember that time ah aku baru balik dari kedah tau nak balik err pergi tak silap ke singapore uh
then aku dah eh macam mana kau tahu then she say oh I know lah because of your accent and the way you talk
aku dah wow I'm shocked man
talk betul betul betul
eh err you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore eh tak silap aku eh no no no err no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually err studies in and err did err did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err I think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
macam privileged gila aku cakap privileged you know
yes yes yes exact bumiputera thing
yes yes betul betul betul then aku cakap lah eh but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then err aku cakap dengan dia lah I was very frank with her I told her err you know how kat sini kita
err macam casing kita punya bangsa kan macam tindaskan
err or we are being like extra lah kirakan not extra lah we're just being err we are we we we're looked down
tapi kat sana it's err it's bangsa dia orang yang look down kau faham kan so dia macam terbalik err macam dia err aku cakap dengan very frank ah then dia cakap ya I faham I faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat is not
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
I find like macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang the shampoo body shower oh wah I tell you mahal sangat macam satu
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot kan then it's like worth it kan padahal it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I always thought like macam is quite cheap aku I when I go over to like macam kedah I go penang wah it's even cheaper sia barang-barang dia then I'm like I'm quite shocked lah in one way or another
and then err I mean I always got teased off lah I always got teased yang eh err by my classmate eh kau tak nak kahwin ke dengan orang malaysia
aku macam ah kahwin orang malaysia kau tahu tak aku punya preference apa
no I'm serious I mean I I have I have this classmate she's orang johor you know so she dia macam dia macam merajuk you know dengan aku because aku macam friend zone dia
no no no that one is another girl that one is another class that one is another department err that one is err sastera that one is my my my own classmate lah and then macam macam mana aku tak friend zone dia babe dia
dia she's from okay dia not very the feminine kind of girl oh dia macam very kasar then dia suara very loud and then dia very macam err like you you can sense a presence you know and then she's very she participate in every college activities
and then aku kalau aku betul-betul nak menghala kepada
ke jalan yang lurus and then my choice of girl is somewhat very feminine you know macam honestly like ya ya ya I mean yang orang yang pakai tudung yang very very very manis to look at I don't know ah that is my kind of preference ah when it comes to
ah sia aku macam siala I mean
ah syak kurang ajar lah tak lah but I don't know I mean I don't know you never know what you never know err our future like who knows maybe kau one day get married or aku one day get married you'll never know
but but innocence that macam aku punya preference when comes to I have I have a type of of of of lady of or a girl and yang aku suka lah and my preference is macam yang putih yang dia no need no dia tak perlu putih sangat it's just putih dia pakai tudung ke very very typically uh
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
sawo matang tanned tanned sawo matang
so err ya so and then kurang ajar tak lah hitam is hitam and then after that um then aku kat sana aku kan macam abang-abang aku kan macam abang-abang singapore kan
ah ya ya ya you know my suara is always like hello
and then lagi suara aku ah my my voice will bounce apa whenever I use the mic when it comes to presentation err in lecture hall
so macam I'm known as the suara abang-abang lah but then dia orang tak tahu lah they akan close all
no I'm serious ah no aku dah macam aku cakap dengan kau aku macam double lives ah kat sana you know like
in school I am like quite err the abang-abang but
ah eh babe do you know that aku that time menang err did I did I show you a picture that I aku menang err prince of the night you know for for an event
macam ah so I I won like a prom kingish punya competition
I know it sounds crazy aku pun tak sangka and I was the host emcee for the event and and the judge was my lecturer so what he he he actually chose me as the prom king err or the prince of the night aku dah huh apa ni
no because um he chose me because I was I was one of the I was ultimately I was the only one who dressed very well that night aku ah because I was wearing blazer
ah ya I was I was wearing blazer then I bought this like yellow punya macam like a macam like a apa tu belt ke apa dah apa-apa lah and then I yellow err
I think ada I pun nak tunjuk you guys ah then so I was quite shocked lah so
so like err like err like I tell you like I I feel like I'm living a double life macam kat kat sekolah aku macam very quiet quiet baik-baik but
but at the same time aku aku kan quite wild kan like you know the number of people aku met aku err make friends with babe by in instagram by in facebook I'm still making friends up to today
I mean it's called networking lah although kawan aku yang kat singapore ni tak err I have I aku tak pernah disclose anything about it to do you know even that time I post err something about me going to kedah in my instagram
wei babe dia sampai err dia he actually
then lepas tu member dah sedih eh so dia dalam keadaan sakit dia dia boleh lagi sedih and aku dah macam eh kan kau dalam keadaan sakit kau boleh fikir yang aku nak macam
babe kalau
so macam ah you don't have to tell the other like I don't have to tell my friend lah because it's my prerogative apa
ya this my acts also apa so but
so I was like telling myself oh no no tak boleh aku dah I I cannot post this kind of err this kind of post anymore because he will be triggered eh ni nama ni triggered dia triggered gila dia triggered lepas tu dia triggered lepas tu dia start questioning me lah macam kau pergi dengan siapa and everything lepas tu dia dah start
ya then dia macam sedih lah dia dah sedih and everything aku dah eh siala ni member nak sedih
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you don't even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet
siap aku cakap dengan kau ah aku pun sometimes pun macam bila dia nak macam err intimate dengan aku aku sometimes pun I tried to elak you know because
berdosa kan kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam add onto ke fill onto his desire dia memang ada desire tu kita tak menafikan everyone has desire desire
but kena control lah aku pun cakap dengan dia eh you control lah you tak boleh terlalu on sangat leh because you never know ah in any bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat or kita tengah intimate sekali err tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila
in that kind of state ke you know because it's he's in that kind of that state state and then he's like he's super sensitive I mean at the end of the day in every situation err kalau tuhan nak tarik nyawa kau people err god would just take away your nyawa lah understood I mean
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies kita pun lagi tiga minute correct kalau you berapa minit babe kat situ
okay so aku pun tengah trying to keep up lah with my studies I mean I'm left with just err semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia lah unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so err I did ask macam consulted over there lah like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like macam temporary contract eh
so aku tak nak ambil contract I aku rasa it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that kau kena cari err rumah then on top of that kau kena settle your visa and all those shenanigans so aku cakap no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
but you see ah the thing is I aku because I'm here mah so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so kalau kalau if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network lah and the end of the day aku pun tak sure lah what kind of err prospects I want to do
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the um I mean that's that's the thing that aku aku don't mind doing lah but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
punya sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe err
err take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day err in language pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa unless you are really passionate and interested in it lah
ah what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best lah but I'm just glad that my study punya period is going to be be done and over with very very soon
then macam ah nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay
oh in Australia belajar macam basics like Mathematics English
err habis tu I also belajar macam
oo my most favorite ah is definitely um belajar apa ni Law because it's very interesting lah like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's uh it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn
dalam err Singapore punya education I mean secondary school punya subject
ya I feel I feel you macam susah nak nak part dengan family kan
eh uh the dalam sekolah you do you do macam any
ya floorball is fun I last time before I pindah to Australia I was also in a floorball team
tak fair
hopefully lah maybe you can try next year you know never know your kau punya chance kan
huh biar betul
wah I've never heard before eh I thought you only can join like you know your only your faculty punya apa tu punya wah I didn't know you can actually do that
oh um sekarang I tengah ambil apa ni interaction design so not a lot of people know about this course because like my school is like the only school yang ada this course
um basically kat dalam course ni I do macam coding dengan design it's a very
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now macam um banyak benda is like about technology kan so ya I feel like this course uh actually benefit me lah in the future
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak uh brainstorm ideas uh for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so uh for you ah you said you were in like um marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
then uh uh besides sekolah kan like what what do you like to do macam do you have macam other hobby ke or apa apa benda lah
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school pastu ada apa O level abeh stress takle fikir yeah
oh during my free time I suka
uh macam uh draw I also like to err tengok apa ni
ah anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because takde time kan poly dalam I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to uh do my hobbies which is kind of uh macam sedih but yeah so
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
but um I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then um maybe in uh um year two then I will start macam join like start trying out for ah I've actually picked
macam a few is err firstly is ah floorball like um aku kata tadi kan as I've mentioned uh floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
ya it is it is that's why macam I'm like a bit takut to um you know join their team because err macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
but I think right I think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
oh mesti sakit eh
then the the surgery bila
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia dia kata like
um it's actually not that painful lah because like you know they put you in uh on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think ah after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects kan so ya
how how how would you feel like macam you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like macam like your feeling
uh I've never I've never apa ni had any surgeries before
I can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit
tak lah I never say
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause ah
apa ni I I love doing calligraphy right so I like macam I have I have like a mini business where
I uh buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like um quite a reasonable price lah so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
uh I like aiya basically like um doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people kan you know singaporeans kan diorang suka macam study kan then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
kan sekarang COVID kan so like uh kat dalam rumah what do you do
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also macam a good way lah for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam COVID kan
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border dah buka then we can go
after macam this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is uh mana ni Japan
I've been there bila when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so macam tak ingat uh I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also macam if it's like an interesting country ah macam menarik you know pasal
like because uh I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap ah so I was like okay ah then I I think if if cause I like to collect
the the work is macam due next week kan then I would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
always use my I'm on my handphone asyik tengok Instagram semua then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like oh dah lambat ah just tidur lah besok boleh buat
macam like group projects eh
oh recently I I ada macam this one err group project like I just finished macam err dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because uh
so my group kita buat we did this uh macam is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time ah pakai then it's like susah ah then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting ah so like when users uh see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next uh page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
Animal Crossing is a very in game now eh a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main ah then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
macam look forward to ah
wah that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
yeah it's good also because like kan year three we ada internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for um untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but I didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so I think macam it's quite it's quite beneficial lah like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
I also had like a similar a similar module I did apa ni uh previously
where also same it's called uh effective effective err communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know err if err communicate effectively and how to like you know gain uh confidence
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting ah but macam sedih ah because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me ah from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who err is uh confident enough ah to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
and macam it's like quite cool lah because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me err there's this macam ada this uh girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like eh I heard you're in the in the same course
then uh she's like uh let's be friends ah then from there uh we started being friends ah then err when during poly because err mostly it was on Zoom right because of macam this COVID situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so err ya then err in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy lah in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing macam susah is that uh is like the modules ah because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never macam done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
oh I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
macam the badge gitu so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift one ah so it's not bad ah tapi panas gila
and the and the worst thing kan towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like eh nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal lah my then my friend dah tak boleh take it kan then she was like ah batal jer lah
eight hours was uh painful lah then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of Tampines ya but it was very very rewarding pasal uh at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
huh biar betul
kay lah not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside lah donate also
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
penat I couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade kan already dah ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa ah kita stand
under the hot sun then collect lor but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like alamak shouldn't have told them
ya true hopefully lah I I I really wish macam this COVID situation will macam die down ah because it really affects ah kita punya life
a'ah so kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap like in both like melayu dengan english so boleh tak
okay maybe kita nak cakap pasal like kita punya favourite show boleh tak
oh movie apa
wait like buta like like how buta hati atau like you know
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like kenapa dia buta
tak senonoh then after that
wait tapi the guy know yang like like
the guy is dia apa tu yang punca yang the girl punya
lelaki tu wah
memang macam like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya lah but like macam it's so coincidental you know like macam the girl dengan the guy is like
kedai ya
but macam it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think kena tengok right
your abang is my adik
I think it's kind of takde lagi is it
pasal dia ya dia orang dah remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like perempuan you know like the girls and then like eh like macam like when I watch it I was like oh my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know uh macam baca buku all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then lepas tu like
then lepas tu he I think dia orang ada like sepuluh seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai like dia orang like tiga puluh lebih and until like
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you tengok like macam dia orang like grow to become like a better person
so macam damn cool because I also because like dulu kan macam banyak orang ingatkan like orang yang suka science semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil like very awkward right like they feel like they macam cannot fit into the society
socially less awkward and also because like macam if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
because like I remember one episode kan like macam young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy nama sheldon
school like not really a professor lah by research scientists and then lepas tu like um banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh fit in
but then over the years apa dia dia dia cuba like fit in to like parties macam because ada seorang perempuan popular ni neighbour dia
kan and then like um dia like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then lepas tu they will they will feeling very awkward because dia orang dia orang like cuba to interact with like the rest
ya dia orang semua ingatkan dia weird sebab like dia datang pun like dengan baju tak senonoh
until the party and cannot fit in lah but then lepas tu then he realise that oh my god
apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok show ni daripada kecil call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing lah because like dia dia dia pun like was single all the way then lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan ah kahwin then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then tak he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that um apa tu to like
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise betul tak like he cannot like
ya so they actually show us yang macam love
terus jump to it
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast kan dia orang carry macam opposite of each other
ya so dia orang cuddle cuddle dia macam like eh let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu then like
oh because you pakai like all the duit birthday for all this
I know you said you show me the photos mah and then macam it's damn nice what
no lah but waffle kan macam murah takkan they will charge you lah
okay but haji lane is overpriced sebab tu lah you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually murah ya but it's at where somerset
that means like macam kalau they are not like at the central area of singapore kan it's usually cheaper
ya lah that's why it's cheaper lah kalau if it if it's at town right confirm mahal
what no lah but tu untuk buka like cafe in singapore quite
so you become like ibu
design the place itself kan macam they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
it's not it's very mahal and like ya
it's like macam you know like we we it's like our like previous kedai lor
ya it's like you need to know makanan apa sedap and then like sometimes kan you hire the chef and the dia tak tahu masak
no but actually makanan tak sedap pun tak apa tau cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like macam it's cool lah like
you know like your makanan K cause your makanan tak sedap kan at least your coffee sedap or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
ya ya lah you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee macam tak ada gula
ya like takde gula is like totally fine with me ya
actually I want to ask you kan macam like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts um if you have like tiga like wish that you wanna wanna
ya like okay like kalau tak ada macam K if like there's no boundaries because you know like macam you tengok aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like oh I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like kan like duit apa tu apa tu it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar kan tak fun
cause like I feel like I'm macam sangat lost
there's too many like macam like direction that you can go like because you imagine kalau you stay in malaysia then like ya tak banyak ya like I think you will only get like
like kan siapa like most people will go either retail and then like or office world lah because in singapore we kita kita believe in like equality right
so that's why I like I like the so for me macam like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working kan like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
even though I know it pays well like gaji besar but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's penat and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay lah maybe you kalau you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start macam betul susah
ya bukan like the
ya cause you know like if you go jakarta like I don't know you wait did go batam ya you went batam before right and you know like macam some places are very crowded then you know they don't care one ya
they do though because that time I went national gallery then dia orang semua duduk dekat
ah dia orang semua loiter dekat you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then lepas tu the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then kena pekik sia they were like oi is you new like why
and then lepas tu the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend lah then I was like oh my god what's this maid doing ah
ya I tak kisah so I just like walk away and then lepas tu they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
tapi like
you are just lucky cause like in singapore macam even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
ya so we all ya I think singapore bagi kita like money to like spend for all these trips sia so I think it's like I think that's a good thing eh
dia sounds like internship kan then I was like wah
ya macam like people from korea guam that's why
macam like banyak orang that like
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business macam it's easy to
okay lah it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like macam I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
you should go with afal adik
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know macam tempat
tak bersih sangat lah also it's okay ya ya they don't care one
science kau ah
kak ya you know inshira right she's working like so called full time in nurse
who's kak epah
kak malinah that one is
ya oh tapi K takpe kita boleh masa baru
oh I see semua busy
ya but I used to be sociable but then I realize like eh okay because maybe I tak I think I know why cause you tak you've not enough money
bagi set aside budget berapa like berapa duit
wah lama sia
oh you nenek say that
mahal is it
like cheese I don't understand yes ibu also don't like but ibu okay with it you know why
I setuju oh you ramen
no ask kakak to help you lah
like selamat datang ke podcast saya
ya but I don't think macam like podcast kan ada
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why bapa all listening to podcast now
ya I know what you mean like macam but for me right if I clean I'll be happy
okay hari ini I went to bath and body works
I went to apa itu to err the dia punya outlet dekat takashimaya sebab I nak beli dia punya err scented candle
ya black friday hari ini
but it's very it's a very it's I'm very disappointed lah because dia punya sale kan
patutnya hari ini banyak um barang-barang kan tapi like semua macam sudah run out macam like the day before dia orang dia orang had a sale
tak best ah tahun ini tak best
you know I went to three one three then after that err tengok-tengok baju tapi so macam they say the price is lowered tapi macam it's still expensive you know
ya semua tempat pergi semua crowded
ya really and then tak payah keluar tak payah queue semua
just now um I was lucky lah because I thought they had this early bird sale and everything then I tunggu pukul sembilan pagi all the way till eleven plus masih belum buka
tak macam dia punya sale on black friday kan macam kaw kaw usually it's kaw kaw but this year macam it's so mellowed down
ya then like um malaysia punya lagi kaw dia orang punya black friday tapi I heard from my cousin dia orang punya black friday like no black friday
ya economy so bad already malaysia kasihan
same sudah lah murah
no not thai odyssey apa nama dia err no another one healthland
worth it sangat and then like kalau you pergi yang punya there are few outlets lah tapi the best one right you find the biggest outlet itu yang paling best
dia bukan spa it's totally all full thai massage
I pun tak ingat hundred and twenty minutes I sudah lama tak pergi nak dekat how many close to a year tak pergi
ya sedih ah
the pasar tani
ya no not normal pasar tau pasar tani
bukan pasar malam dia macam pasar pagi tapi tani lah like macam-macam lah you get like err avocado smoothie lah
then after that pineapple juice lah macam-macam ah I like
oh ah ah ya ya ya queue dia selalu panjang kan
then like kalau I masuk malaysia kan I selalu datang pagi like very very early then dia punya crowd tak sangat macam teruk sangat lah still manageable
kalau ya
ah ada lah
tak shops belum buka sebab I straightaway pergi pasar tani so I sudah sampai situ kan by the time I reach situ sudah six plus
then six plus tunggu kat pasar tani itu err I think about fifteen twenty minutes until dia punya set up semua sudah start then we go in ah
oh my favourite is avocado juice memang sedap
no um I also tak suka sayur tapi macam dia punya avocado juice is like the indonesian style dia macam campur gula melaka semua
ya it's nice dia manis yes
ya can memang sedap
yang dekat singapore punya you can try indonesian restaurants yang dekat I'm sure indonesian restaurant anywhere in singapore ada dia nama jus alpukat
ya tapi memang sedap if I have to choose a favourite drink that would be my favourite drink I really love avocado juice
tak ah I don't really like fruit fruit juice tapi like I don't know ah avocado is just an exception
malaysia yes I selalu pergi situ like staycation with my family over there tapi kalau staycation dekat singapore memang tak lah
ya and then might as well you duduk dekat rumah kan your own home
ya itu lah
yes is enough memang cukup uh sedih merana
I was like okay basically right I kalau tak pergi massage sudah berapa bulan kan my back will hurt so much
so I jenis macam how to say I'm very picky with my massage massage punya tempat tau I don't like indonesian style massage it's very painful
always yes tapi thai massage dekat singapore semua macam so expensive
ada eh
wah nak try ah
sebab indonesian punya uh style kan javanese style punya ya allah I bentan urat the urat the next day my whole body ache like mad kadang-kadang tak boleh bangun pun
yes it's very bad but ya but for thai massage kan I macam the next day more more active and boleh buat macam-macam
um I try both dua-dua I suka
I prefer the traditional one sebab dia dia push your body macam macam way then bunyi ketap-ketup wah
ya sedap
tapi you kena pergi yang macam err healthland lah that one professional and thai odyssey lah tapi jangan pergi yang um tepi-tepi jalan punya that one a bit scary ah
ah ah kaki
kan sedap
sudah habis ya me also
itu lah
err boleh cakap pasal err apa eh nama dia makanan favourite ke
oh pedas type sudah try mala
msla sedap
oh plain then you should try apa itu green curry
should try sedap sangat sedap
it's creamy and then after that dia ada macam a bit pedas-pedas then got manis like all the flavours ada lah in one
I tak tahu
oh oh yang tingkat bawah itu eh
lah I always thought itu tak halal so I always buy the drink sahaja aduh yes now I know oh my favourite thai green err thai my favourite thai drink is thai green milk tea
oh carnation tahu dia orang pakai
no haven't sedap ke
I always eat at this macam err outlet dekat mana eh dekat far east plaza I don't know if you know
huh uh dia tingkat bawah I don't know if you know cahaya cahaya tingkat atas tapi yang thai food ini all the way tingkat bawah dekat belakang
huh uh dia tingkat yang sama macam yang korean supermarket itu
ya authentic thai tapi halal
yes I'm more of a cahaya fan tak tahu kenapa
preference ya err what I like from cahaya is the apa eh mushroom dried noodles itu mm sedap
oh sedapnya
ya I also aduh then dia punya wanton pun sedap but I haven't tried I haven't tried puncak one
why sedap eh
ya sebelah sebelah jer kan ya but then you also should try the downstairs one the thai food memang sedap
chey macam promoting dia punya tom yum I tak pernah rasa tapi I pernah rasa dia punya green curry dengan dia punya err pineapple fried rice these those are my favourite
okay I remember the sebab dia ada dua kedai thai err one is called nana
and then nana you just walk straight turn left sebelah dia sudah it's literally beside it it is called something something thai food
this kita hari kecil saja
oh kalau you datang pukul sebelas atau pukul dua belas memang ramai orang tak ada tempat duduk
so I suggest ya weekdays I suggest you datang pukul sepuluh and below lah
I think not so crowded tapi pukul sebelas I can guarantee you banyak orang
ya ya and it's like cheap affordable and memang sedap
cartoon network I suka tengok err apa itu masa zaman I kecil-kecil lah I like to watch scooby doo
then err captain caveman and apa eh road runner
err ya I love these three last time right masa I kecil-kecil pukul err lima pagi I macam ada schedule tau at five right I will watch captain caveman then after that scooby doo and then after that in the day I will watch road runner
stop watching it right ya me also ya same tapi right my love for scooby doo right is still there somehow
dia macam how to say ah dia sudah macam cari hantu
you know like dia macam cerita budak-budak kan jadi dia punya hantu semua merepek-meraban tak tak macam hantu betul
so like and then like you will try to figure out who is the culprit and everything dia macam put thinking skills in you tau
so like you fikir siapa agaknya culprit ini oh bukan ini then after that turns out it's orang ini so like that kind of thinking skills so that so that's the type I like lah
ya it's all ya dia orang acah-acah macam hantu
it's very funny then like I suka sangat scoody doo sampai beli dia punya err apa itu plush toy
no lah dia anjing apa scooby doo anjing so okay lah I just have it like for fun because it's like memory my favourite cartoon I'll have one lah
yang piglet itu ke
yay you know like masa I dekat indonesia indonesia kan macam tak banyak cartoon kan
so like at like in the middle of the night I suka buka so like in the middle of the night dia orang boleh main shaun the sheep ya and then I watch till the next morning then my mum macam bangun like eh you haven't sleep no I watch shaun the sheep the whole night night ya then that is how I like shaun the sheep is very funny
dia kejap eh hmm I think it was in indonesian
ya dia macam voice over gitu
ya I also pelik
ya ah ya ya dia punya mouth memang tak in sync and it's not satisfying
ya ya ya betul betul
then right you always go malaysia right you pernah nampak cartoon ini nama larva tak
dia larva bukan volcano tahu dia larva is err macam ulat
dekat mana I tak tahu location dia tapi I tahu dia punya mall nama capital
ya tapi dia punya tingkat atas is just an indoor theme park for the kids then dekat bawah semua normal shopping mall
boring tapi larva itu memang funny
okay I don't like but my mum seems to like it which is so pelik ya very pelik my favourite is oggy and the cockroaches
oh ya I mean I also geli dengan cockroaches but after watching that show kan macam I pandang cockroach macam it's the oggy the cockroaches ya ya then I outgrew that fear of cockroach already so ya cause I find them funny
yes ya tapi tapi kan I have a phobia for spiders
I tak boleh spiders I will see if the spider is like one meter away I will scream I just cannot see spider
ya I just cannot phobia sangat because what happened was last time when I was kecil kan err I don't know whether is it dream or it actually happened but I was inside a car then after that the whole car dalam interior of the car is filled with spiders
ya ya I don't know whether is it a nightmare or real because that happened when I was a kid so after that terus I phobia
I tak boleh tengok spider
aiyo I can feel you alamak kalau I pun phobia
aduh aduh kalau I pun phobia seh
ya and then like what triggers it more is that my parents left me sebab dia orang nak pergi beli barang sekejap
ya then my parents found me crying macam orang gila
err but I really don't know whether it actually happen or is it a bad dream itu saja
my parents cakap they never leave me in the car before itu yang pelik
sampai I boleh phobia macam ini
ya until now that time err masa I kecil I pergi school camp pun sama
bukan ada spider we literally set our err khemah on a grass a grassland filled with macam spider tanah
ya spiders tapi dia orang on the tanah so like malam-malam I felt something on me I nampak spider I menjerit I literally went hysterical
ya then I ran I ran to the err guard posts semua then after that it took me berapa jam ah to calm down can you imagine you phobia then you nampak that thing on you
phobia ya ya on top of it you know then bila ya exactly then bila um I pekik itu kan can you imagine I pekik pukul dua pagi everyone bangun then everyone nampak yang dia punya tent is infested with spiders
so can you imagine the kecoh
I I tak kisah I campak semua barang I ada kipas dekat situ I campak kipas I campak lamp post anything over there I campak I just ran masuk toilet and I literally drenched myself with water
then after that I keluar I lari pergi dia punya teacher's post
they calm me down dia orang kasih apa dia orang kasih makan milo semua then after that err sudah reda dia orang cakap eh what happen to you boleh tanya lagi what happen to me aduh then after that I explain lah then dia orang cakap oh patut lah kau hysterical yang lain semua okay sudah dia orang sudah move tempat lain sudah I saja yang hysterical sebab mmhmm spiders ya
cause I find like big bang punya new music is like different tau now dia orang sudah disbanded kan jadi macam sedih ah
ya I listen to those two band sekarang kan banyak orang suka right
but sorry to say lah I tak suka dia orang
I I kalau cakap I tak suka kan kawan I semua kutuk I jadi I say ah ya I like their music
ya sudah tua bangka pun suka K pop
aduh dia orang have a pop up store dekat singapore tahu dekat plaza sing
I pun tak ambil
ya now I never listen to shinee shinee I used to call it shinee you know shinee shiny see sampai sekarang dia bawa bawa
shinee aduh so like last time masa I kecil kan I obsessed sangat dengan big bang um so my file every page of my file kind of the film kind
thin film I akan tulis quotes from big bang
ya bedsheet pun big bang bantal pun big bang
ya I memang crazy about big bang dulu
ya I think so dia punya story very pelik lah dia punya story it involves almost everyone that you didn't expect
ya macam gitu kan like uh I tak sangka I was really shocked
ya sedih duh I was like genuinely sad when I heard that he's out of big bang like wah I grew up with them tau
tapi if you follow him on instagram sekarang kan dia macam a bit siao ting tong ah
uh huh tak percaya you tengok instagram dia
macam siao ting tong serious
itu satu and um dia macam artsy fartsy actually I don't know whether he's like the sudah gila ke err dia memang buat-buat macam gila because dia punya post pun macam pelik-pelik
I don't know how to explain to you tapi post dia memang pelik semua
right pelik kan
macam sudah a bit off
err bedsheet pun ada
then tahun lepas I pergi err dia punya making of the studio
dia punya official set punya tempat
okay um depends lah kalau you fan memang lah it's your heaven there tapi kalau you tak suka harry potter then don't waste your money there
tapi dia punya set ya allah besarnya
dia it's so big then I think it took us like four hours to finish the whole thing
ya ya ya then sudah lah jauh daripada london so basically we empat jam over there and then after that one hour pergi one hour balik
tapi it's best kalau you nak pergi kan you ambil set lah so there is a bus hantar you bus ambil you
macam mana nak kira duh
I pernah pergi
okay okay I tak nak boast lah
most I haven't gone to err eastern europe yet macam prague itu semua belum pergi
no I I have never been to myanmar tapi I um my grandma is burmese
my grandpa sudah sudah pass away sudah
it's like um I decided not to learn burmese but memang susah
uh huh very mixed lah this family ya best lah I mean dia macam ya lah tapi like my my mum malay lah of course but my grandmother dia kahwin dengan melayu
ya my atuk is good looking not boasting tapi when I look at him memang wah any woman akan suka dengan dia at that time
then after that dapat my mum so malay lah I
ya melayu melayu lah melayu boleh
eh tak ada lah
okay ah oh but walaupun um ada sedikit campur err dia punya err darah kan tapi I hold very strongly to uh hang tuah
dengan P ramlee
dia rumah betul dia tapi they convert to museum
ya then um for hang tuah I memang suka history and everything macam gitu lah
so ya I pergi perigi hang tuah
ya perigi hang tuah
oh because dia macam dia bukan attraction to public tahu jadi macam orang-orang yang macam singaporean yang biasa yang tak suka history dia orang tak akan tahu tempat itu kalau dia orang tak buat research
so like macam I memang suka like zaman-zaman dulu punya history kan so I like dig out lah then after that I felt oh hang tuah ah I should go
um the I don't know if you know the puteri gunung ledang
puteri gunung ledang is also another story
oh baru add eh
ya who doesn't watch bujang lapuk
but ya lah fun lah but I ini suka discover about all this malay malay punya history kan so I literally baca pasal puteri gunung ledang and I'm already intrigued
err I pergi library satu thing satu pasal then the other one is internet lor
okay reading itu depends on um what book it is
ah ah kalau you give me roald roald dahl is it called roald dahl
I tak akan baca
best ke
oh that one notebook punya orang kan
ya ya they were just jealous jealous sikit aduh ya that's why ya yay I found find a friends fan okay so basically kan um I boleh bangun nowadays ah I boleh bangun pukul lima and then I'll be like okay I'm bored I'm going to watch friends really
ya oh my god same you feel me yay err then masa I pergi itu kan I happened to go to primark primark suka ada macam themed err themed christmas style so they will sell all the themed punya barang-barang lah so I pergi to this err one of the primarks lah then I saw a friends collection
pullover ya macam jacket tak ada zip
ya ya ya memang cosy gila
kalau I kan I tak nak branded you just give me primark and I will be happy for life
sebab they have themed
they have themed accessories itu one thing the other thing is that it's murah
um of course lah there is a different sikit lah tapi dia macam tak melampau macam other other kind of brands lah
and it's still worth it because you tak akan jumpa primark dekat singapore
sudah lama pakai pun masih okay
you pernah tengok yang um monkey tak
I suka tengok
ya ya ya that one mantis sembahyang solat mantis
uh apa eh aku pun sudah lupa
aku sudah cakap solat mantis tengok lah ketawakan orang
mm kejap eh
I'm just gonna leave it as solat mantis
tapi yang paling kelakar is like when they interview the body parts punya ini apa ini apa aduh
ya dekat tampines
ya dekat tampines sister aduh
dekat tampines
ya I think kalau they interview me ah I hopefully will get like fifty
orang tak tahu apa gusi gusi is gum
I mean nervous pun macam gusi you don't know what is gusi
aduh and then there's one person cakap apa I don't have gusi
kelakar lah
I also don't like watch local youtube tapi because I like to um macam bab melayu-melayu ini I suka dengar orang macam tersasul ke apa kan so I suka tengok itu then laugh my lah lah you know
best ke
ya sudah tak ada sudah
I think the ya the last romance movie ah I tengok dekat cinema is apa eh crazy rich asians
go watch lah it's very nice tapi yang I tak suka is macam dia tak macam mix tau
macam dia punya portrayal of singapore macam very atas gitu
huh uh it's like nanti orang ingat semua kita kaya I have overseas friends dia orang ingat oh you crazy rich ah I macam I macam huh no aduh
sis literally if I have the money I will borong the store
you tahu tak dia punya macam dia macam jacket dia macam fur fur gitu
dia macam banyak-banyak colour tapi dia macam jacket and it's furry furry on the outside
tak pernah nampak eh
oh bukan yang hood punya dia tak ada hood
I bought it err okay last year masa I kerja I pergi rush pergi uniqlo I don't know why during my lunch break lepas itu I pergi capai itu oh my god it is like the best spend out of my pocket money

uh ke I bought it in malaysia no lah I bought it in singapore
twenty to thirty dollars macam gitu ah
but what am I saying uniqlo punya baju semua comfortable
ya uniqlo punya memang really the best ah
tapi if you want to find like macam vintage vintage and oversized shirt kan cotton on is still the best though
okay I tak suka oversized shirt tapi depends kalau dia punya
dia punya how to say graphic dekat depan itu cantik then I will probably buy it
if macam tak cantik I tak akan beli lah
tapi honestly

then when I was primary six we went on a holiday then after that I kena accident
then in the accident like I was at bali then I was going back to singapore from malaysia then after that uh the car swerved cause like something hit my dad's car dari belakang tau then after that he swerved inside the longkang
then after that he went atas balik like he swerve the car back up lah but then when he got back the car on the road was like the other side you know like how it apa tu the car cars are going this way his car was already like this side and he stop then after that four of my siblings were out of the car like tercampak keluar then when I suddenly I was in this longkang like nasib I sedar diri if not they wouldn't like find me cause I was in a very deep longkang but then my legs were all in pain so I cannot like panjat the longkang ah cause I wasn't that steep but my legs was really really in pain then I shouted for help then this guy piggyback me up cause ambulance wasn't there at that point in time so I was put inside this car then my adik was also inside that car also aiman aiman
dia pun kat dalam kereta tu then after that bila ambulance datang I was like vomiting a lot lah because like the apa itu how to say ah traumatic
no it's not trauma it's like macam if your body or your throat then macam dia force the food out
then after that I vomited a lot like a lot it was the worst I ever vomited then bila apa itu aku

ya cause I keep muntah what
I keep vomiting then after that he say huh busuknya and then like I like what the hell
like dia not ya
then after that they almost like took another person like cause my bed is here then another granny's bed is here so it's like tepi-tepi tau like side by side then after that she went like the person dah already angkat the grandmother
my dad wasn't there at that point of time and then my dad was like eh this one yang pergi singapore bukan itu so the the granny almost went to singapore then the the nenek was like very confuse lah
was like what mana aku nak pergi
my dad had to angkat gini
when aku sakit dorang like like a lot of people was around then he was stitching some stuff aku tengah sakit tau then after that they keep like talking loudly
ya dah draw tau and then they wanted to cut there then after that my dad straightaway like apa tu
call singapore cakap that they want to bring me back even though like they can do the surgery there because like aku nak balik kat malaysia pun lama juga what and then like my this one wasn't growing a lot there wasn't a lot of blood clot so like I like went to singapore first without my family yang the rest kat situ then I had my surgery
ya mine is worst cause I need surgery but the second worst is my my adik
ah syami syami dari sini all terkoyak

so like like it's terbuka the flesh all terbuka they didn't clean the the wound properly
then after that um my mum also not happy you know malaysia right they they ask you they insist that you go to apa itu that you stay in the malaysia then they ask you for money every single time they ask you for duit every single time
uh they ask for duit everytime then you know even my my adik want to wants to go back to singapore cause my mum already dah already going to inside ambulance you know the nurse have the audacity to say my mother that he cannot bring the baju that he was wearing cause that is hospital punya baju
then then dia cakap if you want to bring you have to pay tengah sakit-sakit baru nak gi singapore then you say that

their school pun their atas eh their top was plain plaid blue it was very very nice then the guy wore the plaid type
sakit ah mata
hmm ya lah you can kau tak amazed dengan senior jer kan
aku I didn't pandang seniors at all
cause most them actually thought I cina so I like okay and I didn't hang out with you guys much what

sec eh eh sorry sorry primary five primary six sec five eh primary five primary six apa tu uh I had this friend nama dia alia
um she live near here also sometimes I see her but she looks the same anyways ya then I was very rapat with her lah I thought it was like we we will be best friends that kind of thing and then after that this amira came into the story then when amira came dorang started to be rapat then at first I was okay lah then we can all rapat together what then I tell her like you know we have this stay back during holidays for primary six

ya then then their house is like when I went to it was so lawa like you know like rich kid then after that she wore like this this like apa tu jubah butterfly jubah
ya cause that time we went during raya what
then after that she also satu hal ah I think she don't like me also then she
her mum pakai tudung I think she is religious
disappointed she she ah dia pun ada adik the adik I think now secondary school still
me uh um buka cerita this one I had
cute ah dia dulu
shut up diam ya every morning
then after that um then after that he confess his feelings that's like okay ah I I mean can just okay then we keluar together
and then after that like I'm when I was relationship with him right I didn't felt like myself like I even like cause that time I was ready like after after uh secondary school then I during secondary school cause I wasn't wearing hijab fully what
then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear hijab and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
haikal now with another girl that time kat paya paya lebar kita nampak dia pe
siapa no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
with izzat I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with afiq like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like nak tengok rambut pay more runway or something the whole time he that one
is the ya but it's very apa oh ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that one they don't care that kind of thing
then like dia kerja kat cafe
ya and dia kerja cafe sekarang actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even pandang orang bertudung
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say oh you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better lah like he don't straightforward say because he try to jaga my hati at first he don't know how to jaga hati perempuan then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like kenapa marah I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends cakap that there is banyak difference from him dulu and sekarang ya which is good lah then after that from that like eh this guy is different like really really different from my exes
kau what about your exes
I think she want to elak I think she want to elak like to touch each other cause it's haram to do so

like he made fun like cause there was this girl she's not wearing hijab but he can like sengaja see the sepender

macam mana okay ya paedophiles out of the way
technically it's a podcast cerita malam punya podcast kan

macam perangai perangai dah change ah macam gitu
alamak so sweet nya
alah macam gitu pun boleh alah
kenapa monyet monkey lah
dia kepoh ah jer
I know lah tapi macam third party terdengar
that's mean tak baik sia
alright makes sense it's okay you want clarification just as in secondary school sekolah menengah
who are like there to like support you kan so macam like if you if you find like friends who are girls then macam they just want to like
befriend you so they can get to know like your best friend or something like that tu salah macam salah sikit
but I think like like the karma that's going to be served to me but kalau
tapi kan if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
dia cakap dengan aku like uh the way I
break up with people macam traumatising sikit
dia cakap macam sikit jer lah tapi
like revenge lucky revenge kan macam
oh okay for siapa
I will give karma back to him sia like macam
oh macam like he will say oh girls like perempuan tak boleh buat ni pe kena ada lelaki semua
ah ah ah ya ya ya macam gitu macam gitu tapi kan like I'm I feel macam
macam like you got nothing to prove
aku rasa because right I realise
if macam like
like some guys kan macam them they try to over like try to be overconfident
no because kan like kalau dorang macam like they get into a relationship with you then dia rasa macam okay
subconsciously dorang macam project their insecurities on to you
um does it's like whatever they are lacking then dorang macam insecure gila babi then they like ah macam mana I cannot
um tapi like confidence is good like in a person tapi macam tapi kan if you're like too overconfident then you are just macam hiding something then it should it like you're hiding something to the extent where you are actually projecting your insecurities on other people so please get therapy
please get therapy ya please get help because macam I macam I don't like the fact that macam some guys ada
because dorang macam live so macam insecure because of like maybe what somebody else cakap dengan them or like something that somebody criticise them or whatever and then suddenly they are like insecure for their entire life and then they like project it on to you and then now suddenly using that and then fuelling that anger and then they are like I'm angry at you because somebody said that I'm not tall enough something like that kan a'ah
I I I I will agree lah women are the same but I feel like macam like perempuan semua we are so like in tune with our own emotions then especially we will like in like a group of girls and then we're like very comfortable with each other which kita boleh blush out berbual banyak-banyak we can talk like this end to the other end like how we're doing in this conversation
macam podcast sia tak tau
I'm edgy I'm cool I'm so quiet oh my god macam sounds like me
um okay alah kesiannya oh no
even if you are just friends ke atau macam mata air semua you don't own anybody
macam overly clingy
to get kan duit susah

nine nine nine abang polis
sorry ah dogs are a bit macam susah
you need to train them macam really train them because macam kalau for cats kan like they can be a certain way kat rumah
but but sometimes macam you go to the vet clinic then they macam ganas ke they like to scratch around is normal lah because they're not comfortable mah tapi kalau dia kat rumah they're very comfortable they're very loving macam is so easy for them to like
they're not like dogs dogs kan you need to macam train them properly like okay here is where sit or like here is where you poop pee whatever
a'ah the only time dorang macam very noisy is macam they belum sunat ah
a'ah belum sunat
ya ya ya when they belum sunat they macam like itchy then they cari cari mata air they cari lover so macam of course lah they very
but dogs dogs sometimes they just bark for no reason like kalau like if you have jin in your house like they would just bark
oh got one time when I was younger lah dulu-dulu macam primary school there was a
and then it broke through like one of their glass panels so it's ya it was like a there was like a macam
it's so tiny though I don't know it just like okay first macam it was already at the door then I was like okay
tapi got panel so I'm like whatever I'm just going to wait for my lift then
then suddenly all I hear is the dog barking and then suddenly he's at my ankles so I was like what do I do macam mana ni
cili padi ah
macam macam short people
but like of course these people who already got their doctorates from like nineteen fifty two dorang macam aiya I did it before you can confirm do one
ya but but right okay um so singapore always says like hi it's a very difficult time so like if you need if you need um help please go find it and then they like give you macam like all this like hotlines to call if you're having like anxiety having depression blah blah blah
that's why otherwise macam
bro tak boleh lek lek pe
kan macam like stop demonising tattoos or like macam or like piercings
macam it's very bland it's like macam you you masak ayam masak merah but there's no merah
ya so so can we can we bring it back um I mean it's not it's been taken out but can we bring it into the society where we can normalise ayam masak merah with the merah

she reply pun like after every two three days lah um ya
eh should I mandi
motor kuat bro
my father hantar me to school naik motor since like primary school
is gonna go and pergi mandi
mm pada pendapat saya
kalau boleh I want a fit body because err I suka main bola err football kan
so err kalau I'm more fit I can you know run faster err I can play better I can improve my performance ah in game
kan you tahu I main untuk err kelab bola
err dan
apa tu err
err I juga suka pergi gym I like
bila I go to gym I
of course kadangkala like of course everyone wants to have good looks lah you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks what so err ya lah ya got pros and cons lah for both but
err mungkin I pick the fit body lah
mm yang tu betul juga err
going by that thought process kalau gitu mungkin I pun nak ah good looks ah sebab
err macam you kata pe good looks tu err semua genetics tapi fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get lah you know then
err tapi bila dah tua err semua tu good looks semua
habis lah jadi
kalau long term
aku rasa fit body lebih penting lah sebab untuk err general health and well-being kan
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes ke apa
err kalau gitu
mungkin kan sekarang everyone err selalu cakap pasal err global warming ni global warming tu our climate change ke apa I mean you just look at our weather lah everyday also in the forecast also always wrong one they say rain won't rain will be so hot then kalau err hujan pun
can have sun sometimes then it's like macam air panas aje
so I feel like err humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors lah err mungkin like slowly over time when the sea levels rise ke then all the you know kampung by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like mungkin will have err
lebih banyak err natural disaster semua
tsunami ke gempa bumi ke
extinct mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada COVID kan tu virus
tu virus semua like
especially kalau tengok err kalau singapore okay lah sekarang itu case semua sudah fall a lot right
mungkin dia orang punya culture semua berbeza kan jadi
err mereka suka peluk semua kan jadi like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
ini dua faktor lah yang mungkin akan ah menyebabkan err we as humans to go extinct lah
you cakap pasal africa kan tadi aku ingat lah err kat sekolah we learn about econs right err they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then aku teringat lah pasal err err extreme hunger err yang disrupt disebabkan oleh poverty kan jadi
I feel mungkin that's another reason lah there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like err humans slowly like the population reducing lah I'm not sure if you boleh sampai extinct semua tapi
err I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer yang miskin jadi lebih miskin then um
err all these err kind of err things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system tak kuat kan jadi
the income inequality makin naik and the
ya lah so maybe the if the government don't do um anything to tolong kan the orang yang miskin orang yang
tak mampu then um
maybe lah this could be a factor that might contribute but mungkin err bukan main cause lah untuk err menyebabkan err apa tu err extinction of humans
skill tu you like do you mean like err
if that's the case right I mean maybe untuk saya lah err
I hope to be able to how to say macam like
boleh read people better lah
cause kalau gitu I can I boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu and I can like um
I err mungkin err bukan saja cara you cakap tapi err
mungkin err body language intonasi semua err
err ya lah itu like that's one of the first skill like I feel like err would be very beneficial lah and it's bukan satu skill yang senang untuk belajar pun it's like
lebih banyak confidence ah like especially um
dalam scenario macam public speaking depan err banyak orang
um like stage confidence lah not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people lah but like err buat err presentation ke err nak buat acting ke err
anything that has to do with like err maybe a high pressure situation or err like situations with like other consequence kan macam like pertandingan bola ke where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can dapat something lah you can win something at the end of the pertandingan ah so
like this kind of err situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say ada coach yang tengah scouting err player yang err baru yang young talent semua
err I feel like it's it's a very useful skill lah next time bila nak kerja semua kalau boss aku err suruh err buat presentation depan err colleagues aku semua then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation dia orang semua faham apa yang I nak cakap
then um kalau the third skill maybe err
like being more optimistic err positive fikiran semua err mindset
nak err aku nak yang
lebih ceria lah like I punya mood semua like
I feel like kalau any problem aku hadap
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset err kalau err as hard as it can be susah ke tak susah I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill ni penting cause it can help me to push through like let's say um
err gym kalau aku penat ke apa my next my next set I can just err keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
besides gym lah like err bola ke like next time nak kerja ke anything in life like I I feel like ni ni benda ni confidence dengan yang positive tu err sangat penting lah but ia bukan skill yang
senang untuk err cultivate ini skill err mesti
ambil time yang lama lah mesti build up over time tapi kalau sekarang I boleh dapat ah tiga-tiga skill ni wah paling best ah
oh third one macam like err it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
apa-apa pun boleh lah
wah kalau free tu
tapi kalau gitu overlap macam skill kan bukan saja benda physical
sekarang sekarang benda yang high value kan yang kita kena bayar banyak
err let's say err gold ke or stocks yang property ke apa
bila you cakap free kan
free untuk kita sendiri ke free untuk semua orang
kalau gitu stocks lah kerana kalau I boleh dapat stocks yang banyak
I boleh jual I boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu I can just use it to spend on whatever I want lah whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich what
dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla ni semua
err apa-apa lah yang err involve dengan benda teknologi
semua ni benda err dia punya stocks semua naik naik exponentially lah
if I boleh dapat ni benda semua I I can just you know err
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua you know I can I can whatever that is material I can dapat dengan wang err I can I can have lah
like time is limited lah setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja
I tahu lah kita tinggal di singapura ni singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
kalau you boleh teleport you nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
just having that additional satu dua jam setiap hari I mean it could be even more for some people because
you can get more sleep your tidur is good you err
your health pun lebih baik um
you know you nak err like
ada orang kan yang
dia orang err very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga
tapi bila ada lebih masa ni you boleh spend time dengan keluarga ke girlfriend ke apa you know your family time is a is a very err important thing but I feel like in today's world is err is lacking lah because err people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like selalu kalau err jalan sesak traffic jam or accident hujan ke then you waste even more time lah so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic lah but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself lah if other people also then you nak pergi holiday over the weekend pun boleh apa err so
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you lah cause you can teleport you yourself and then semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh
are you more of a marvel fan atau you lebih suka
mungkin hulk lah kerana
dia tu like
he's still a normal human being lah but bila dia marah then then only dia transform kan jadi like
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation terhadap diri saya akan it will be very high lah from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
tapi like as needed lah I can I can still possess
kalau you
untuk saya I feel like a lot of people like sebab I banyak training like
like err semua orang selalu label me as like err buff strong whatever
especially dulu bila bila eh err start of this year right when I had the shoulder err shoulder surgery and all that
whenever I am injured lah like not just the shoulder surgery actually like dulu I pun ada ankle sprain ni semua
I selalu err rasa macam
hati tersinggung sikit lah kerana like
um be at the level that high level of fitness um because everyone err selalu tengok saya macam
like bukan sahaja uh dari segi performance tapi like
bila I ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal err
badan saya lah jadi like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
as much as pressure tu tekanan tu
boleh tolong untuk err drive you motivate you tapi like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you memang your mood
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further lah you boleh cause itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam spiral
jadi susah sikit lah untuk you nak um
terukan aktiviti harian lah or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you memang bukan malas lah tapi like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you nak just like
is it can become a real mood killer lah as much as like oh you think like err having this fit body like we said earlier lah tadi um
biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu label yang baik lah tapi
mungkin at times can be a bad label also lah I feel but
I feel like this is the paling paling common lah yang label yang semua kawan-kawan saya
dream occupation saya is err to be a physiotherapist kan so
also in five years six years time lepas uni depends on my situation lah if especially
kalau I masih single ke I dah attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
like err bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person lah but okay err kalau kita assume tak ada orang tu I masih single I
masih tengah focus on my own goals
err lepas habis uni I'm probably be bonded to err one of the err government hospital kan
my work hours mungkin tak akan flexible sangat jadi
whatever free time yang I ada mungkin like
sekali seminggu lah I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like um like how to say like
I I still go to the gym you know err kalau tak cukup masa maybe just a short workout lah empat puluh lima minit ke apa
you know and ideally would be of course with a with a friend lah cause kalau you train seorang-seorang pun err after a while it it kind of
could be a bit boring sometimes could be unmotivating and stuff tapi ideally if you have always have err
a training partner especially a training partner who selalu banyak tenaga banyak tenaga very like
energetic you know err selalu err give you a lot of vocal cues you know pushing you
bila dia spotting you kan then err I feel like that that would be ideal lah like this is the this is the minimum that I hope lah I just
um berharap like next time I I dapat macam work life balance lah orang cakap like
kerja pun I dapat dream job I I enjoy my work I boleh tolong orang like especially like if I can
become like a private sports err physiotherapist after I dah habis I punya bond dengan err hospital government hospital right and um
at that time I will look back and like I as an athlete like I did I sometimes and I need but like I tak tak cukup duit lah because this kind of service all can be quite expensive lah but I hope to be able to
tahap yang paling tinggi lah because like
bila dengan pertolongan daripada physiotherapy ni err you punya muscles semua like
boleh recover lah you punya recovery semua err lebih baik you you
jadi like
I tak dapat jadi I nak kasih orang lain untuk experience especially athlete athlete yang masih muda masih ada potential untuk
tak tahu lah mungkin boleh represent negara ke apa err ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario untuk saya lah like
bila I kerja pagi ke apa or mungkin I gym pagi err kerja sampai malam tengok lah then
but of course kalau I dah ada err orang lain dalam in my life lah like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule lah but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe sekali seminggu just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship lah cause I feel like it's
kasih you punya masa kena sacrifice sikit lah untuk dia cause um
oh ya cakap pasal itu I forgot one of my passions is also to
err kayuh basikal lah jadi like
ideally if if my my working hours pendek sikit um
I boleh slot in masa untuk err girlfriend masa untuk err gym tapi juga untuk err cycling lah and
paling best kalau I ada satu kumpulan cycling macam like a cycling bukan maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group lah then
like every maybe bila tak panas lah maybe
early morning ke err lewat malam ke then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling ah road cycling bukan err trail riding
dia memastikan yang I masih aktif lah bila I dah tua nanti
kerana gym mungkin after some time like bila dah tua err apa tu
you punya joints semua mungkin ada another problem lah tapi cycling
err dia punya risks tu rasa kurang sikit lah
you you ride a bike on the main road or jalan raya kan
I feel like err asalkan you it could err ikut peraturan jalan raya semua you follow the rules you just play safe lah you are you pakai lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group lah is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
I bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa I just like for casual for enjoyment like
untuk err general health and well-being sahaja lah but
it's a fun way lah for me untuk untuk dapat kan err
kerana gym
you punya cardiovascular health you punya jantung semua tu tak akan um
won't be trained as much lah tapi kalau nak buat cycling ke untuk you lari ke apa your
your this apa cardiovascular health will err naik ah you will improve boleh maintain semua
jadi um
err in the long run lah is aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin
err tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau ideal scenario I nak lah kerana
each ride will take about what dua jam
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause kalau gym empat puluh minit you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay lah but err kalau cycling you kena gear up semua you
jumpa kawan and then you go for your ride it it takes a while lah and mungkin along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some minum slight makan just snacks then
oh okay um sekarang I'm doing like part time um kerja part time so macam um I do some um actually doing financial advisory um ya at the same time doing um freelance freelance works ah ya um macam and doing translation works for untuk bahasa melayu to and bahasa indonesia ya
ah no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had um indonesian punya maid so sometimes ya
uh ya ya ya so actually um like last time my maid selalu um talk to me in in bahasa indonesia macam I know how ya how to speak ya hmm
um actually it just baru baru start so macam um macam just had like briefing then uh so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
ya I think macam health actually quite important lah um ya I rasa macam when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy macam what's the what's the point what's the point kalau kau pergi kerja everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy lah for your good for your health and stuff like that
same lah sama sama ya is is I think macam it's quite common gitu to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun in
you kerja oh so baru graduate also
oh drama side drama side macam buat apa like day to day like what is it like
oh macam just macam entertainment untuk dia punya budak-budak that kind of thing lah
hmm so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company macam allows you to to to to take breaks in between lah
mm dia mm okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common lah untuk like some some of us yang baru start kerja then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that macam when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like macam is it a mismatch of expectations bila you baru start kerja you thought it would be something else
mm actually good good that your boss macam I recognize that you you need to take a break then um then kalau when you're better than you can always balik go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me uh ya lah macam I work for dua tahun then lepas tu uh I tried dua company tapi macam uh at the same time it felt different tapi macam same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also macam tak tahu if it's the industry punya issue or kalau I need to change industry atau change company ya macam that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to macam take a break and then um from there I explored different different punya industry and then um at the same time I kerja part time then um macam trying to at the same time I explore lah whether I feel nak stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough lah one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right macam you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya at least some more now macam it's COVID punya period then then nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
it's something better than macam nothing right
ya ya ya I think to be honest macam singaporean man a bit cautious or like became fikir banyak sangat of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then kalau doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so macam just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new sekarang I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so macam at every ya every setiap pagi I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for macam tiga jam jer then um ada assignment then um some project ya just learning new things I guess
oh the the webinar is actually uh era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's enam enam bulan then ya at the same time they are macam giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya tapi those hmm tu actually untuk mid career adults lah macam those that ada work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new lah I guess ya
tak payah because everyday macam is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
but how macam mana nak teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
hmm okay I see I see I see sebab dia what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
ya macam overload of things to to do right do you feel
tapi what about the your your other work punya colleagues like do they feel the same way
hmm sounds very challenging lah macam susah so
ya so macam I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment lah so I started taking um um I started joining this financial advisory punya company then dia orang give like trainings um to to prepare us lah macam how to how to like you know prospect for clients macam how to um basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I rasa sales punya skill is quite important macam in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or kalau be it ideas or products to anybody lah so so I rasa macam it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn macam susah to macam convince people um to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process lah I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
hmm I macam baru start meeting clients that um uh there are some um potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that ah ya
so um other than that macam I think you what you said about um an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive um like make you macam want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess tapi macam I haven't actually um had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then um for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to macam earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense macam or even though sekarang I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy macam ya like I don't bangun tak rasa macam stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work macam you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this macam how I felt lah everyday after after work last time like you balik rumah macam tak ada mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
ya I think it's common like macam I spoke to my kawan my friends dia orang pun macam rasa the same the same thing lah ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
then you got try macam try company company lain tak like because ini your first job kan
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether macam is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
is it you are supporting financially ke or dia boleh pay for dia punya own things like oh is it difficult
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay um so um ya it's really macam it's I think sekarang we're in a very difficult punya position pasal there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
oh you are twenty only oh sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my mak and my my dad don't pressure me lah like because ya even though I'm already twenty five tapi dia orang macam they know it's not easy lah our time to like they said last last time by twenty five dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak you know that kind of thing but they but they don't macam push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think ah macam syukur lah like I feel quite
mm I see ya I think macam same my family macam not very affectionate also when growing up what macam don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
you ada connections with like theatre punya um like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
um actually macam I just told him I am exploring something new lah while because like at the same time also um learning like macam tengah belajar new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so macam I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything lah like I can pay for my own things like I ada savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that lah like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like ada ada like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
ya I think macam having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace lah it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing macam it you make you look forward to nak pergi kerja you look forward to seeing them
then dia orang dia orang tak bayar hmm
hmm oh you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like macam mana like how does it work
so what do you think macam you want to try ke you don't want ke
at the same time um I rasa like while we're still young important to save also lah saving is quite important ya ya so macam since since I was young kan I always believe in saving then macam I am quite thrifty lah macam and like macam tak spendthrift sangat so like I made sure to to have enough savings lah so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
tapi you got you got try macam apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood tak
oh but now is the intake right you said october you just check macam apply for fun lah like what's what's it there's nothing to lose kalau you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right hmm
ya tapi you can just tell her later kan like macam that you you're but you're officially left right you said
tapi ada notice period tu semua lah
oh kenapa
then kalau kalau you leave you must bayar dia punya six thousand ke tak like it like if you do finally decide
tapi macam you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then kalau tak then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
okay actually I ada kawan yang just started the early childhood she also was from engineering punya field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so kalau you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about dia punya program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so dia totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people macam sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not macam out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya macam some ya ya ya that feeling what's segan to us just sometimes that feel that way tapi actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience macam whatever you have experience lah then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least macam lah like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry lah then at least you roll one out
so actually I met her from um like a random punya part time job also then macam we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and macam after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya macam random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
I don't know I think macam I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of macam thought into it it's not macam a fleeting decision like I was really macam very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my punya bosses all like understand lah like my work was difficult lah like I was facing a difficult punya client macam everyday hentam on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
at the same time macam as in like I said lah because I had macam savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important lah like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing lah ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine kalau you ada children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing lah like take a break and not work kind of thing
oh probation ah macam sekarang sekarang is probation period is it
tapi dia punya contract what the contract say
no but your contract said you have so actually macam you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then dia orang tak they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
you have do you have siblings like you ada kakak or adik like
oh only one kakak lah
huh sorry oh see I see okay ya I'm also not tak tak not close to my siblings my elder siblings too pasal dia orang dah marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common lah
so um I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like macam sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that hmm that is so important macam not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
tapi macam like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to macam cafe where dia punya server is so friendly like dia bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending dia punya food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too

suprisingly ada eh cause macam like apa
newton or something then I have to keep like tukar tukar actually no like last year I at dhoby right and like my line is the green line then I have to keep like switching and stuff
yeah I feel like I mean like I understand that we have to wear the mask and stuff tapi like
macam so leceh you know like I'm still so
yeah I was supposed to go for like two concerts this year you know I was supposed to go for yungblud and rex orange county tapi like COVID
mm begitu lah nak buat apa kan
apparently like supposedly my ah first ah music festival lah kirakan so macam like excited kan
habis COVID habis like pun tak boleh masuk I really miss you know I want to go like
you know makan sate malam malam
murah and it's like so nice to
then like she sell err she her husband sold those like bakso cuts you know
and because of COVID cafe dah tutup seh then macam like we feel very bad because it's like
she's kind of like she lives in a kampung right then she just like gave birth and then like
tak ada duit like the only source of income was like
from her husband then macam like baby tak ada duit then the other time
we called her during raya the baby tengah demam seh
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like kita like very rapat dengan dia
bila raya right like dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri you know like I mean
if they live in you have to stay in then after that like you like for raya you cannot balik kampung which is like
their bandar is right so like their family members are all back in like kampungs and stuff
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because uh during like hari raya like that time
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like pocong just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers lah you know macam they dress up macam pocong gitu habis just to like
scare cause like malam malam kan dekat
dekat hutan semua tu so macam like it scared them and then like
patah balik sia I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
I think they did tried to do the same kat indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west gitu
it's all pakai laptop eh
like you pakai laptop then like it's just what like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like kenapa tak buat
you know like kenapa tak buat
err tak tak tak tolong mak or something like that you know so I'm just like
I told you kan like the day before I pergi err the malayan council
then err you know portion dia orang kan besar kan so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like mahal kan
then uh he's like okay so I just met him and then like kita lepak
sekejap I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to panjat you know cause like
also then after that like at night I went to like jumpa kawan you know just to lepak also
I don't know there's this thing called the the rendang daging salai or something
it taste like you know the kuah is sort of like rendang then with linguine with like scallops
sotong and then there's like daging salai on top lah which is like I don't know
really sedap lah it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out tapi for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about rendang being the nicest but
tak sedap you know everything is sedap
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause macam like tak ramai orang
so macam especially with the whole COVID thing I pun like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's sedap you know and then like
pre pre COVID lah they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels gitu
I mean it is arab street lah everything there is like mahal and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
ayam madura which is like oh yeah
ayam geprek you know something like that like very indonesian based
but it's just a bit leceh cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
I don't know I use you know like kat Telegram they have those macam groups kan then macam
you know they mention things like for example like oh they never mentioned the pay like berapa or just like
oh you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then macam like
benda gini all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there what
habis dia orang tak ni so I was just like
yeah and then it's like macam cause like sometimes like
at least tak payah you know terfikir fikir you know kalau dapat ke tak
don't tell you the full truth then macam like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
akan lama gini you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay lah macam
but I thought like okay lah like lama lama pun maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most apa apa boleh makan kat luar jer tapi still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
so that stupid idiot of a president cakap kan like
like the president cakap lah and then the next day
really ada orang ni seh like actually drank bleach and stuff
mm tapi macam like a bit
that this like donald trump like macam dia punya priorities is just not
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already tengah COVID
so I feel so macam kasihan for them lah that they have such a bad president like this
common at all you know like so kasihan huh
hey that's not bad I mean like no offence lah but for an average melayu you know it's
okay lah like you know you cannot expect much from orang melayu lah honestly sorry but yeah
you know reciprocate also it's a bit like sakit hati
kau tahu macam boring seh like
cakap lah benda interesting you know I received a joke once like
cinta like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate dulu ah
habis like macam for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
from the second you match ada like
dua puluh empat jam for you to uh respond then like
no I think it's macam like concept baru because macam like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
like wipey mat melayu sort of things like you'll actually find like
so macam
err there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff tapi now I don't know lah I mean like cause
cause like Din Tai Fung sana kan halal right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always naik like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year tak dapat pergi it feels so weird you know cause like
normally when I go to I get very like jelak because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
tapi like
this year tak dapat pergi it's just like I want to go back
I thought halal tapi tak halal then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not halal in singapore
but I was from a wedding tu I like
I came in like my kebaya so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
me and my cousins all nak cabut because like
cousins so it's like rapat but
not very rapat
going for like jemputans and stuff like that pasal macam like when growing up gitu
macam I don't know I'm like very rimas cause macam panas kan then you have to like dress up semua and then like
pergi ah wedding tapi tak kenal siapa you know then macam I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore tapi I do enjoy if it's like
then you talking about the biryani like I think it's always a star of the show right then um
satu kali that time uh my my aunt I think
just I just decided to go lah because like macam I was I I know her what
then she kahwin
the biryani was just like next level
so like tak payah makan for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like kasi kita bawa balik then like got the ayam masak merah then the nasi minyak and all that
okay okay nasi biryani would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like nasi minyak
then like rendang and ayam masak merah that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
like from ah um you know ikan tiga rasa like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be biryani and stuff like that's so weird
who like got married like during like the second week of raya and I feel like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very pantang you know cause I feel like I'm from a
then like to have a wedding macam like no offence ah tapi macam like spoil seh
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just kahwin like or something you know
I mean like why why do people do it buat penat jer cause like normally like
people are just more tired during ramadhan you know and then like
kejar maghrib and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's terawih and stuff like that I think this
ah tapi I
ah I think recently they uh naikkan to maybe I think fifty
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then macam bigger honeymoon lah kirakan tapi macam
I'm also like the first child right so macam I feel like I understand my parents point macam dia nak you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know kalau tak
invite satu like if I invite like sikit sikit tu I don't want like dia orang sakit hati ke apa
tengok lah macam mana if anything also just like kahwin sikit sikit then like you know like
you know so macam like a lot of like the kampung kampung roots are still in within my family
so macam like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know macam gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
silat thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I pengantin apa like it's like I will be pengantin once in my life only what so macam like
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like panas cause like
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like budak kecil all can like run around
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super geli and it's so merepek cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
you know macam like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
I thought about it like australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like dah banyak
singaporeans there's banyak asians then like you know the whole like kiasu thing going on
so I think to myself just like you know okay lah then mat salleh at least I know I got chance to be the top right tapi like
dengan asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
nak migrate like like you said lah with the whole like tradition
uh like you know it's like very like new like you dah biasa with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
like I've also been called like celup lah like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you dengan your melayu
gitu but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
no lah I feel like it's also important cause macam like it's just like your self identity juga apa then like
I feel like at least in singapore also macam like the malay community is like
rapidly macam the language is dying you know I feel like
personally because macam like okay lah like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in bahasa err in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
it's just different lah macam like melayu sini the standard macam lower you know then macam a lot of people like just
dah tak tahu pakai like they don't really speak
then also macam like some of them like don't even know how to cakap you know
so yeah lah then like macam a lot of like little like ah traditional things are like dying too
like macam like anyam ketupat you know macam like
my family ah bila raya we still make it a thing lah macam every year we still do it you know and it's like
sedih ah because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable err like memory ah you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of raya and I feel like for me
holidays just like I mean like hari raya and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know buat kuih raya and like ayam ketupat and like just like getting already getting the house like raya ready
macam best ah like you know but like
then ya then anisa pun
I come late also lah cause dia kata dia nak datang pukul tujuh eh tak tak tak dia di
rumah pukul tujuh setengah then sampai pukul
lapan setengah begitu then the end she said because err
a'ah memang jauh
dia tinggal lagi jauh dari niza
why she comes to why she is coming to school cause she got itu
hari ini dia ada photoshoot
who is the vice head menarik ah
eh dia orang nak start recruiting untuk itu
ya but is it some ad hoc tak ada heats
sampai dua-dua sekali seh
that's quite funny though like once terus dah
sad I think next next sem kita set out account ah
macam kan I don't know how it works but maybe ada profile serious how is it
one hour one hour terus dah dapat
I tak perlu upload gambar sendiri
then what if like the person dah kahwin then lepas tu ada masih orang nak try hit on the person
menarik oh god
oh it's like didn't see lah cause like your apa tak nampak apa-apa pun kan
eh then you know the Instagram what's that filter where they have their halal meter or haram meter thingy
oh cause like someone told me one of these dating apps they have this halal haram ratio or something
we have been wanting to do it just for the loves ke
to go but then I always feel bad because you like you say orang kat Muzmatch macam dia orang serious
ya it does oh ya about apa yang you said
how do you feel about that isn't that like a dating app but then macam physical
kan kan tak macam kalau dekat
kalau physical physically macam desperate tapi kalau dalam dating app tak desperate ke
apa-apa lah nak buat apa-apa apa lah apa korang lah
oh so much sia on topic ini
paint tengah picnic oh my god that is so cute
ya oh my god then like the apa
but then macam kalau the date doesn't go well I will be like bye I don't really want to share this sunset with you
oh then I will stand up lah try my best to stand up to him then like if macam
dia tak kisah pun like he is so obnoxious and so full of himself then I won't even bother lah I will just walk away
wait apa tu catfish
nineteen and this boy sudah gatal
I think I do cerita pasal dating apps or dating
wait cerita netflix oh
dating dating semua
oh kan apa ada some cerita-cerita cinta pasal
where the parents just like apa pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something
macam dia orang beli under the fiancee skim thing cepat kan then when I see it I was like ah
nah ah just say they macam I wouldn't want I know that through all these apa
bodoh apa-apa apa-apa sebab oh multiculturalism at its best
then I saw one uh caption uh bukan caption ah macam post
dia cakap pasal the politics then I think it was about this
uh like it's so sad macam because of all this kind of things it's just some disagreements
uh kadang dia orang tak sedar diri tau
macam sedih lah macam what can you do also
tak kadang dia orang akan suddenly berbual pasal the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff
mm kenapa orang chinese tak percaya ah macam
ya kan orang-orang chinese tak faham lah
then lepas tu dia orang kata apa
hidup dalam susah hati ini dalam negara ini
ya that's the thing like everybody keep telling me like apa macam eh kita orang sepatutnya macam bersyukur lah sebab
kita orang tinggal dekat singapore singapore bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat ya ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims
entah lah
kelakar eh tadi berbual pasal dating abeh tak pasal-pasal berbual pasal politics pula
it's just so campur up
ah tak nak
I always stop dekat second around
macam banyaknya rajin budak ni kuasanya rebutan
oh then kita orang sama lah tak tahu lah kalau this time dia orang akan
um accept ke tak we shall see
a'ah that's why like I thought we hari ini nak keluar
nak nak meet up with my friends then

tak tak hendak tak apa lah just get over eat I just get over eat
other house on TikTok and stuff and they've been doing macam ni

ah tapi ada satu macam
macam quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
entah macam ada beberapa challenge
oh tak there is one challenge that I like
is was like um calling my um my girlfriend or wife a third name lah I think that's quite cute actually I like that one but some other challenge macam questionable
tak tak she doesn't follow me anymore yeah tak nak kecoh sia
and then his pelamin is so pretty I love it
kat luar some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I kaypoh kaypoh tanya dia kat mana
takde any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then orang akan marah and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the pelamin ah you'll see the bride
dengan dress dia lagi
oh my god I was thinking of that tetapi kan tetapi eh tapi kan macam singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
that macam abeh tengok sunset kalau sunset dia lawa oof lagi best then kita boleh tengok sunset sama-sama

then macam at the same time I'm scared like hujan tempias even if there's like shelter ya and confirm mahal seh ya would you want to spend so much

aku rasa macam insensitive oh nanti orang ingat aku buta padahal
no no not ini baru kebakaran dunia
eh alah nanti dengar I will say this after the recording ends
once again you pasang your earpiece what ah
ya aku rasa kalau kau ada if you have if you had one superpower I think so it will be will be the world will be fuck because like
imagine kau kau marah kat aku tapi kau tak puas lepas tu seluruh singapore
tapi kau kat dekat sana kau tak puas so instead you go for the whole singapore
and lina pula be like why you doing this who will kill me
apa eh
or go to search go search naruto punya macam you know wikipedia you know got naruto punya
aku that's why aku no it only show I'm fucking tired
jap aku nak adjust aku punya
the doctor said that because I went to check out from my eyes what the doctor cakap tau apa is because aku rabun too much then the skin is lose then the muscle is weak so what I have to do is
rendang kenapa seh
tapi kalau you makan rendang selalu like wouldn't you get like too sick of it
like kalau for me kalau I makan rendang hari hari or like
it's like jelak seh
tapi I don't like I don't like to makan
to me kalau nak makan rendang kan
just makan dengan ketupat je
I don't like serunding
no lah I don't like serunding
okay with rendang but I don't like serunding
wah if I can only eat one dish for the rest of my life I rasa kan
a bit a bit susah leh
I think ayam lemak cili api
ayam lemak cili api or kari ayam
kari ayam hm
kari ayam kari ayam if my mom masak
because because right wah her kari ayam is
kari ayam power gila babe is power gila like dia punya pedas is just nice abih makan dengan sambal belacan then
dengan nasi oof
power gila ah
I think the idea of curry noodles is bad like imagine you lemak letak cili api and then you letak
mee mee dalam ee like
lemak cili api other than that what what do you want to eat
dia punya tarik abih dia punya daging dia punya lah soft punya lah
banyak you know dorang bagi banyak abih dorang punya soup pun like sendu gila is it sendu
macam oof macam sedap like
no macam
thick is it thick like tebal
pekat ah pekat
sendu is it sendu or seru
what is the most pettiest reason that you macam
satu orang buat kan like like kalau dorang buat then you macam tak suka
macam you don't like ah like like it's like you're petty like you really macam nak tempeleng gitu
I think right for me right wah I don't like kalau kalau dorang gedik
kalau perempuan oh my god kalau kalau like any if I see this minah eh this girl come up to me macam
cakap like
eh punya lah ee macam nak
macam nak lempang je seh
like I want to hit her I want to like ee like ee can you not be so gedik a not
and then another thing is like kalau dorang macam
like dorang macam step step
dorang macam world lah world lah macam
macam world lah
like dorang macam they're like
ah ah ah macam dorang bebual terus macam eh aku aku like aku pernah seh pergi kat sini pernah seh do this do that macam like
oh I got like hit up by girls at this club you know macam
ah macam macam big macam world ah world haprak gitu ah
cuba try cuba try
oh macam dia macam like oh like like ah ape tu
macam like I'm better than you tapi actually tak lah tak lah better sangat
macam I more better but then actually you not that better lah
kita party lah sia
I think kita
kau tak payah kerja kalau we don't have to work right
what do we do I rasa we enjoy
kita party
kita macam buat hal masing masing I think we will achieve our dreams ah
I think that is for sure macam
bill bill yang nak bayar ni semua
kalau we don't have to work then don't basically macam
the only reason why we work is nak dapat duit kan
buat hal masing masing ah
we achieved our dreams like we macam finally enjoy life why what what I would say
tak ada makna ah gitu
macam tak ada makna meaningless lah
tak ada challenges ah
basically time lah I think yang the most issue for my
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like oh nothing but to me I rasa macam twenty four is like oh my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I kena kahwin kena beli rumah
to me the only factor that I rasa that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to macam
ya but at the same time macam they still like if to me that those are like lucky people macam dorang macam
bertuah lah to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though dorang dah macam tua tua gitu macam forty plus tapi macam masih dapat
dapat buka apprenticeship
buat ni semua like
but at the same time kalau asyik asyik kena
macam like if you always like you know kalau you always work work hard je asyik asyik work hard abeh lepas itu macam
macam tak ada tak ada luck like people don't like it's just not your bidang lah it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try masak you try restaurant
retail abih you try ah apa lagi ah engineering abih lepas itu
you don't know you nak buat apa
so macam you'll never run out of things to like
betul juga ah betul juga ah
what you say ada ada sense
kalau you cannot minta for like more wish
okay so my first wish I rasa I would be eternally rich
so I can beli anything that I want
macam at least macam treated as human beings lah
at least macam in terms of salary in terms of of the will
kaum lelaki tengok kita basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
but the thing is memang betul lah darjat wanita dah naik kan memang tinggi lah di islam tapi
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since kita kecil sampai sekarang dah besar pun
kalau kita nak macam you know like cakap example like wedding my friend
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because ah suami dia is apa itu anak seorang
they want to buat besar besar because they are only going to have one wedding ever
kan membazir and then like to her she feels like she don't need lah because most of the people she won't she won't even kenal
and then at the same time macam in at the same time you so you follow lah if you mampu ke tak betul tak
uh ideal matches to be kahwin
must be soft spoken must be so macam
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there macam like
yeah I like like went through whatever yang kesakitan all this nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam
is at the same time macam you do have like some of this
regret macam eh kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap yes kat dia macam
okay for the third wish kan
kita kena make it a fun one
kita kena macam as merepek ah tapi macam like
like jangan serious sangat ah
so kirakan I can masak any makanan that I want
entah eh
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to ikut recipe
I for me I don't really macam I tengok recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't macam ikut one tablespoon
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I tak ikut
you know I mean agak agak is like fun leh it's like oo you know you are making a portion or you like making something like oh it's a hit and miss like oh if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more gula and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like macam like that time I masak sambal tumis telur eh sambal tumis like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs dengan
buat sambal tumis tapi kan tak ada bawang merah tau like there's no onions
so I decided to use bawang putih
and to me because mummy kata
bawang putih is like a good alternative and also like you know bawang putih is more flavorful macam kalau you masak nasi goreng if you don't have bawang putih it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important lah basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much lah because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
and then I did macam lada kering
and all that jazz and then after that I tengah masak kan
and then I was just like I feel like dia punya
bawang putih punya taste macam still overpowering you know
so I letak sugar and then it was like uh
so I put then I put kicap and then I put uh it was like a it was like a frenzy ah it was like a
like a carnival like basically macam
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just campak kat dalam
yes imagine you ask me for rendang
I can cook any rendang you want rendang johor rendang penang rendang sarawak
italian rendang you want the crispy rendang
rendang and yes I want uh the skin of the chicken is not crispy you know

and then she was like like she baca baca all this
apparently after we left after we leave the punya mall right then then I was okay already then I rasa lapar then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay lah let's go eat dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa like some
macam sikit sikit/malay lah like
where mummy masak me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday
because like mummy right she only masak bila birthday for the rest of my sisters
but my birthday right she always masak macam sotong
or macam kari ayam lemak cili api macam this kind of but she never masak any birthday for me then I feel like eh
how come never masak me birthday then I ask ah mummy never masak me birthday for me ah
then she say you you want you nak is it then I cakap ya
then she masak me birthday and then I sakit on that day
okay what how how bodoh is it
if one horse size otter eh that one seram seh
tapi kalau hundred otter size horses
kecil kecil macam miniature gitu
ya ya ya that's true you like tendang tendang tendang then it keeps on coming back
yeah that's true that's true I think ya I think I also ambil the
is macam macam imagine kalau you jumpa lipas abih besar punya ee seram nya tapi tapi like
tak sanggup tak sanggup one is enough
yeah I think gila seh
tak ada orang yang boleh ambil dia ah like tak ada orang boleh defeat dia ah even thanos you know even thanos like start ask the army to rain down
apart from rendang if you talking about like metaphorically
kalau if you talking about food I think I will get uh kari ayam
I already say kan
kalau metaphorically I think right I'll get
a bit too sassy lah macam that's why I think people don't like
like macam macam okay a bit world ah I guess
no lah but it's more of like okay like arrogance as as in macam
entah eh arrogance as if like I'm a bit too over confident
entah eh
merepek lah what you mean intimidating you not intimidating at all lor
no as in macam is not even like you not even intimidating lorh
yeah I'm I'm talking about macam or you talking about work ah
ya but if you have to kalau you nak kena pilih satu je
Jollibee atau Arnold's

mm fikir fikir
but that at the same time if you have if your body is fit your muka haprak but then your personality is nice then okay lah
and if you manage to macam you know capture me with your humor then
topic topic perbincangan
cause yellow is a good energy punya
like you look at yellow then you just like oh you know sedap mata memandang gitu
so macam
turun a bit the pain threshold
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you rasa macam
macam like if I want a sandwich I get a sandwich if I want airpods if I want a pair of airpods I get airpod if I want a laptop I get a laptop
and resale and kahwin everything
itu lah you don't have to worry
nanti what if you jadi pervert ke apa
like my greatest enemies right and then see what they're doing and then macam blackmail them
entah dia macam merepek ah
dia macam world ah I guess
to me dia macam world sikit ah
ya dia macam tak serious come on man you are the avatar man
I rasa tak keluar tak tau ah
for so macam tinggal
tapi monday I have to like upload
I mean macam I have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but I'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have I'm far behind and I have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
everybody else dorang tak macam explore tau dorang macam just do one that one that one that one that one that so macam
I don't know how they can just like not explore lah I I like exploring I like to macam
yeah I like to macam
if I see something I want to develop a bit more and more and more macam you know let it let it branch out
I see it so it's gonna be this if I see this it's gonna be this so macam
cause it's sunday kan
but I feel like this year macam I don't think they they should actually have
merepek ah like who comes up with this stuff
ya but at the same time and then like you you then dorang kata dorang nak do salute eh for nurses
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus macam at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
ya macam sausage all this kena potong potong kadang kadang pun I macam makan
okay lah is it bubble tea or macam Boost

the tudung is the most expensive it's four dollar
you gave me yesterday you saw right I wear that green tudung and it stick

but I mean now can still work also what but I think they just cari hal lah just because the business is going down
bodoh kan

oh kalau tak accepted habis dia tak bayar eh
okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams cita-cita saya nak pergi ke australia untuk continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat important
pasal kalau ibu um susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya cause saya anak yang paling last
so for ayah
ayah is quite easy you know
you know but like when I was supposed to go saya not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
so tak boleh yang typical macam invisible
oo tu susah
okay awak awak jawab dulu
okay awak nak jadi macam spy kids lah
mmhmm masukkan makanan dalam oven terus boom dah siap is it
awak tak sangka kan tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu
iya lah
as you got wow now after we think ya masa tengah fikir ni
allah ada timing eh okay
ten years ago saya dapat jumpa sekarang
kan yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang okay
ya pasal saya suka collect gambar-gambar lama
ya sama macam ibu collect collect collect
mm tiga belas ya
saya tengah secondary one
a'ah macam jer cause
ah cause after second year third year habis
sama-sama lah kita macam
nak buat kawan susah lah
tak buat apa-apa pun ya pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai telephone
ya tapi saya tak boleh tidur often it's cause
uh student leader saya student leader
ya saya student leader
tapi in your secondary school
sekolah yang paling tinggi cause my school is more of a like a music school
siapa yang suka first of all
ya saya kena um bully about my looks
macam compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause dia macam carefree at that point
right you macam tak kisah
pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam it's okay
dalam sekolah apa eh
saya paling suka during saja
makanan is
simple makanan simple
like it's cause tak mahal
nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat but
kau pergi east kan
jawapan saya is the dua dollar
dekat dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde
dah tutup it's cause before I graduate I heard that uh they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall tu dengan bubble tea I ingat
saya tak fan
itu yang belakang drink stall eh
ya I remember I asked them before maggi apa dia orang pakai just cause
nak try buat kat dalam kat rumah
macam tak boleh make it tak tahu
saya rasa saya chef bob awak rasa
awak chef wan saya rasa saya tak mampu
and you know me apa-apa you kasih I I makan jer
I tak tanya apa benda saya makan jer
inshallah benda tu halal inshallah tu halal
oo soalan yang susah
wow sensitive question dia
uh waktu secondary school kan
wow I know I am I macam macam-macam lah since ah macam macam macam dari primary school it's if primary school I
it's like netball sama dia punya rules is sama macam netball
exactly the same cuma dia punya um the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
ya very complicated tapi saya buat and then I also did
um benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya
I nak beli air
cause it's recess time of course saya nak beli air so I pergi canteen seorang-seorang
beli air terus ada this random girl came
and then I look at her cause I macam lost kan apa seh dia ni berbual
saya tengok dia I macam huh and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
okay after that selepas itu dia buat lagi and lepas tu dia buat publicly
dia depan-depan orang you know but after she did that she walked away eh no and then she said uh pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
saya macam tercungap tu kan so I tak tahu nak buat apa
so I just masuk dalam kelas balik then I macam just doze off cause
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time kalau you ingat like myspace blogspot was a thing
abeh macam tadi you cakap oh student
tak necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause kalau adulthood we don't usually care about people right
if dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual you know what I mean
but bila secondary school it's hard cause you have to
soalan apa susah lagi saya tak tahu macam mana nak fikir
just give myself confidence pasal kalau pasal saya insecure
and only if I had a bit of confidence to just kick out my insecurity saya rasa macam everything is gonna be okay
no saya pun tak tahu nak cakap apa
uh suka hati apa orang nak cakap saya percaya apa awak cakap
everything is susahnya soalan awak
bosan kan
agak bosan cause you're not content
so dia
saya rasa saya overthinker
you know I tukar jawapan I I actually nak cakap bali
bali balling tempat bali is everything that you
kita scared of height
conquer dalam bahasa melayu is
benda tu lah saya nak conquer saya nak conquer fear saya
saya really I'm really scared of heights
lagi rumah awak punya um yang wall tu kan yang kat luar rumah it's not like a sturdy one you know actually you know
paling worst is rumah kat toa payoh I tak tahu kalau you pernah pergi
rumah dia dekat toa payoh so like the
walkway tau it's senget so you're going down and the wall
uh the side wall it's actually very rendah like your
lepas tu I nak pekik apa tau
oo soalan paling susah lagi macam
muka macam sedih kalau tak pergi dengan awak kan takkan nak text awak babe tomorrow saya nak pergi dubai got ticket free
saya pergi um burj khalifa belikan awak
ya belikan awak
um kunci key chain right
dah tu jer lah saya mampu belikan untuk awak
makan banyak-banyak abeh sehari jer tapi dia hantar balik tak
tapi you tak tahu nak pergi mana
I tahu you
you makan jer dah memilih dah cerewet abeh you nak step
nanti dia kasih you makanan lain jer you macam
itu awak everything that you have been saying the genre it's you
mm you tahu I I tak suka movies sangat
tak tahu saya cuma saya suka falling in love the whole part of
like you get to know the person you fall in love you get a heartbreak fall in love just repeating the cycle that's me I really like it anything you tahu um nicholas sparks movies macam macam gitu favourite saya
movie dia banyak kali
tak bosan just
is cerita white chicks
itu favourite
I remember script dia semua
but tak tak macam seram ke
what's the craziest um cerita paling
yang seram I wouldn't say seram
konon macam alien ke apa ke mana tahu masih ada tapi kita tak pernah nampak
wow kita tengok banyak cerita zombie tau
so I think I don't like to think this kind of things saya tak suka saya benci fikir pasal gini
boleh anxiety tau ya cause
I think virus macam sekarang
sekarang kita COVID jer kan
although in singapore they only say like macam
I'm so sorry saya tak pernah saya tak boleh fikir lah sekarang tapi ya taiwan went to zero like really quick
actually we did though remember dulu kalau uh ada SARS
tapi SARS tak teruk macam gitu although enam tahun kan if I'm not wrong is it six years we had to go through but it wasn't like the whole world
cause I rasa
or yang bagus
ya awak ni pandai lah buat soalan macam gini
uh saya rasa
cause untuk kita macam tak ganggu kita asal kita nak kena fikir pasal benda gini
awak lucu lah um akhir hayat
awak jawab dulu saya kena fikir I'm a foodie
apa daging just daging
daging steak
taste awak mahal
awak pandai lah
sebenarnya saya nak cakap pasta tapi saya macam fikir pasal diri sendiri pula
ah saya buat pasta
sedih nah tapi sedih juga kalau hari-hari
okay awak pilih daging saya pilih ikan
both boleh steam
boleh grill boleh macam-macam
macam cara kita kan chef wan dengan chef bob
apa punya restaurant ni
kifarah lah pasal kita get
oo kifarah apa
kifarah kan dalam bahasa kita kifarah
uh saya rasa rasa
oo apa eh cause
you tak akan fikir buruk pasal tentang tentang diri you sendiri
you confirm cakap macam you baik dengan orang macam gini tapi saya rasa
sebaik kita ada buruk kan betul tak
saya buka main door
I think I buka I think a few times chey nak cakap saya baik eh tapi tak lah
I want to say good looks macam
uh awak nampak
like macam very presentable
kalau presentable dengan
I'd prefer oo susah kalau diri sendiri I prefer badan sihat
saya sekarang jer jalan tercungap-cungap
kesihatan kesihatan is everything
you nampak macam you muda tapi kalau you jalan sikit jer dah penat
asyik nak main jer
ya mak you muda eh
I know what you gonna say saya dah tahu dah apa awak cakap
dalam partner awak cari apa
oh no apa
that I'm not doing is eating I've been eating macam-macam saya makan lah saya tak
saya tak tengok portion apa saya just makan
ya siapa kisah
a'ah ada macam-macam baru makan
nanti seminit lagi saya um
to exercise tapi nawaitu saya is to exercise
saya gain weight
saya tahu awak saya kenal awak saya gain weight like crazy
badan saya kecil dengan saya nak cakap saya tak tinggi tak tinggi sangat lah but
sedang-sedang sahaja badan tapi kalau saya step on the weighing scale
I'm like fifty five apa ni saya macam
ini weighing scale yang salah ke saya yang bersalah
tapi ya
kawan-kawan dia macam oh my god huda
semua nak seh
macam gitu eh
so you nak maid lah
or is it you nak pembantu rumah
cause muka saya dah kering jadi saya macam insecure sikit
saya tak nak jadi materialistic
awak rasa macam oh dia orang ada ni
or dia orang ada ni saya tak ada
although awak ada apa yang dia orang tak ada awak tak akan
err my name azmirul I'm from singapore poly sekarang sekolah
you wanna talk about kita punya singapore poly life lah so far
sekarang boleh manage ah tapi like last time when I first entered aku really tak minat the course
so it was kind of susah lah untuk aku
oh pasal dulu my first few choices was uh business business finance abeh aku minat tourism
so I put there only my first six choice ah then my marine engineering was aku nya tujuh ke lapan ah
I not sure but yes ah aku aku tak minat tapi
aku nya points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so aku just kena taruk the aku just kena taruk any course that I can put lah
tapi along the way alhamdulillah
aku minat ah aku minat
aku minat ah aku minat marine engineering nya module
so kau apa sekarang lah like what are you doing in school what are your activities
aku in dikir barat ah as you know
I I always tried to pull you in dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk so
now I really want to know the reason why kau tak nak masuk dikir barat
okay lah boleh boleh
muay thai pun
bukannya muay thai nanti
ada stage fright ke like macam ada spectators tengok
right faham faham I understand
because sekarang pun COVID
then like kita lima hari five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then kadang-kadang
sama juga I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in my apa tu uh younger days ah my sec one sec two menengah satu menengah dua that kind so I
every month bapa kena call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise yang
so that's when aku sedar lah that I have to bulk up kalau tak memang aku takleh survive N or O levels
I did get twelve points ah takleh
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject yang aku ambil
then aku end up in poly now
ya what is the most macam
what is the most naughty thing yang kau pernah buat secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most yang paling
so kira kan self self nominate kau terus masuk
actually talking about yang student student council student leader and
dulu like what you said I was very naughty nakal gila
macam apa aku buat semua aku kena tone down pasal aku chairperson of the class and my school dorang ada selalu macam best chairperson
best leader best apa so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last lah basically macam in the rankings so macam sec three tu memang quite tough lah is like I'm still naughty
but end up nanti cikgu jalan
dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong ah I go angkat
teacher you need help ah then aku angkat aku angkat kan masuk staffroom
so kira like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so aku just suck it up lah
and my teachers in sports leaders suka aku
pasal aku not the quiet type
but students leader punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku naughty sangat so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school lah tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada different opinion about the same person
that's that's being naughty lah dekat sekolah
oh kira tu naughty ah kan
kira tu naughty ah kan
tu bikin kau paling guilty ah kan
guilty tak eh
jadi cikgu tertipu kan
so macam dorang dah bless ah
so lepas O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time ke
aku kerja yang kau tahu volunteer volunteer punya
yang nampak dekat uh fast jobs nanti dia cakap oh you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance ah kira that time too is big money for me know so kadang-kadang kalau ada shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
that was my basically aku nya work for my whole N level till when I go sec five ah
so aku akan kerja all the way
then basically nothing much ah aku just kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
experience aku pernah tau sekali kerja
tiga hari jer off day aku nya gaji at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus
selepas minus
so if anybody interested join staff masuk lah ya so
irony but I do have some problems lah I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama age
the same pemikiran lah basically so aku just
aku just tahan for two months then aku just took adapt aku just try to adapt to the situation lah yang aku aku was in
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly baik gila
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities semua dorang kena beli then they have to keep at home
wah salute ah dorang
I don't dah
oh is not always the sama part lah
like macam
as in aku prefer tau honestly aku would prefer a busy
a busy working environment pasal at least aku ada benda tau nak buat like something to do kalau they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
macam benda ni semua I can see cikgu kita are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be macam very independent because in the future semua benda-benda engineering ni semua
they won't hari-hari tengok kau buat
that's why macam I feel engineering early brush you lah and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop ah
macam betul-betul flop then susah once you know once dah jatuh in poly susah nak naik balik
aku masuk shore which is first first semester so right after this semester aku probably has a month's break then after that aku dah kena masuk intern lah
by dia punya sailing
aku nak belayar basically I just want to go
explore countries negara semua negara england semua whatever lah
uh yang ada ports semua kan saudi arabia ke whatever
so aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak
dapat sailing results must be very strong
so aku legit work very hard
untuk aku year one year two tapi
aku punya type is aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir ah
so at the end of the day aku don't mind shore kalau dapat keppel okay lor
kira very good orh keppel
ya betul
but ya lah you so you are willing lah kau kira willing untuk sail every year six months
time kau balik pun dah penat
so your ultimate goal is to get macam
pasal you are not away from your family too long
surveyor macam benda relax ah
okay ah during during circuit breaker and all we all semua stuck dekat rumah
pelik but yes aku
aku found a love from
karma medic lah nama youtube channel
and aku suka biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class duduk belakang dengar
but ya the love come back and I feel like kalau I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni ke apa
ya so talking about uni kita belum lagi lepas
wayang ah
so ah the frogmen one tu yang paling gerek ah
so aku nak masuk navy tapi aku tahu
aku tahu tak probably tak ada chance lah masuk navy kan
ada chance will be slim
but yes ah so kalau
tak aku nak try my best to go police
kalau police pun
aku kena train banyak so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
kalau tak pun I don't mind
eh pula I don't mind civil defense
tu pun pergi tau sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai
my father never go so aku rasa I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always kena hijau from the trend lah that's what they say lah but no hijau for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring lah my opinion macam gitu-gitu jer ya okay lah tengok macam mana
tapi kalau aku dapat air force who wouldn't take it
chey wah pandai seh tak ah intelligence
what was your score though they never tell you tak bilang
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult ke apa
kalau let's say ke dah dah minat nak sign on
kena berapa bagus wow
ada size dia ah
sekarang berapa years
masih eh masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun jer primary school
bila primary school kan nanti
nanti kita tengok movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there kita semua dah
dah basically know the type of person you want to be like err like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first macam entertainment punya movie show kan was ah
macam I didn't realise tau yang itu semua watak
as in tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua just rekaan tau I didn't know
then I thought macam okay let's say macam dulu undertaker betul-betul lah dia jahat betul-betul lah dia nak nak nak menang jer nak kasi orang sakit
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like macam undertaker
buat mata dia yang roll eyes back
so kira macam last time primary school was one of the best times because
kita explore ah
kita explore banyak benda
satu hari kita undertaker the next day we john cena the next day yuka civi
ya in primary school also dulu kita suka buat banyak parkour
striker yang
bebas like horse kick right
have you ever win the finals pernah menang
who's your bogey team ah macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti
macam you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
for me kalau bab-bab
macam atau activity kan
I was goalkeeper you know you know when kau penjaga gawang in primary school
if the goals you concede so we basically second round kita dah keluar everytime
kita masuk south zone kita keluar kita group stages
then secondary school I was in so kau tahu ada banyak
lah yang joget-joget sambil marching
ah make the police create the league untuk macam orang-orang tak
untuk all the budak melayu not only budak melayu lah budak melayu budak cina there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors semua masuk
tu pun second round kita out
I join dikir barat
I join dikir barat and my first ever performance
so of course after the performance aku nangis siol
aku really my heart was pouring ah
so that that was when my mood for dikir honestly
aku kena aku kena step in to change
for dikir barat
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents ragu-ragu ah
my parents will think eh macam mana aku nya anak nya results
sekolah pelajaran akan jeopardise ke tak
that kind of thing so aku pun macam second guess ah aku second guess but I love dikir barat so much
in dikir barat twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like macam nama engraved dekat dekat kau nya trophy I also never had the recognition of
pemenang dikir barat singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
it's a heavy responsibility tapi we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
macam teaching
your kawan takkan eh coach pasal they coach kau marah dia tapi kau as a kawan kau still tolong that kind of thing
we have our ups and downs juga ah
kau cannot
kalau kau always feel that you are at the bottom
dah kita dah improve at least be happy about it jangan cakap yay tak last
that that that pada aku tu yang paling penting ah dalam
dalam inner change
you can't keep thinking of eh kita dulu last
as in berbual macam single ke attached ke seeing someone
mana lah aku tahu aku dah lama tak jumpa
kau boleh click ah basically
cinta monyet eh dulu
happy ah dapat berbual dengan kau talk to you for an hour get to know you a bit more
and terima kasih ah
eh hello dah lama tak nampak kau how are you ah
eh can ah go makan lah
biasa biasa jer
penat ah tapi manageable juga ah baru habis peperiksaan seh
eh aku terdengar kau nak jadi jurugambar eh
so sekiranya kau kena like menyerah segala-galanya mengejar impian anda apakah anda akan menyerah
never mind lah slowly slowly eh order makan dulu ah
I think I want nasi goreng you leh
eh if you were to makan a dish for the rest of your life right apa kau pilih ah
tu ah tapi power seh sedap seh
that time ah aku pergi south korea aku makan dia punya barbeque shiok tempat dia pun boleh tahan the place damn atas
um agaknya adalah juga macam like report card or like artwork last time ah zaman secondary school cause last time I always like do a lot tapi biasa ah hilang ah
aku ni sekarang penat kerja sia so tiring to work
eh never thought about it sia agaknya kita depend a lot on government kot
betul juga ah tapi kau tengok ah situation these days like a lot of people keep asking for help leh

eh tapi bukan kau belajar map abeh kau nak jadi photographer tak nak pursue lain career ke
kirakan like side job ah
aku punya course biasa ah art

wah sekali ah we never realise our bank account negative already
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan aku dengar that time kau kena pergi concert kan apa jadi ah
I don't know eh cause ah I quite close to my family but right my course I think like kebanyakan ah I dengar dia suruh belajar overseas cause singapore tak offer banyak arts then like usually offer is like overseas tapi don't know eh overseas dia jauh seh macam kat gitu kalau you can choose tempat nak belajar overseas where you want go
okay okay make sense make sense but eh kita macam orang melayu ni susah seh nak belajar overseas cari makan semua
to be honest kan aku not the type to tengok ah why right aku that time sampai tak tidur seh kau tahu cerita girl from nowhere
tak tak it's a series and wah I tell you wah eh my mind I cannot think straight eh it's a thriller show dia macam she damn sinister like then I went to research a bit ah then dia cakap like she's anak like a devil's daughter and then right she always like come back she will mess up with people I think you should give it a try you should go try watch you leh what kind of show you watch
so kirakan dia syaitan tapi dia tolong orang ah
no leh ah to be honest ah I a bit scared eh that place damn ulu but don't know eh banyak orang kata best don't know should try maybe you can go one day

tak apa lah dah puasa dah boleh gain balik eh tanya ah what's your favourite kuih raya
wah legit ah lain kali pergi rumah dia dia buat ah
favourite kuih raya to be honest tak tahu eh agaknya cornflake ah everybody's like confirm favourite one tapi kan sekarang these days banyak modification ah ada yang tukar nanti letak kismis lah eh tak suka seh I like the original one
hmm biasa biasa biasa ah last time I also like that ah tapi wah sedap [seh]
tu ah like personal experience right then wah every year confirm hor you open your cabinet raya finish already still confirm got a few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth
I think ah I don't actually remember seh I think hor wah I think I just go makan man I go makan but sad lor makan only five people per table mah so everyone have to sit far far apart like now also you want go makan see everybody also sit so far apart
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
to be honest ah aku ni boleh consider ah ada obsession sikit singaporean ah typical bubble tea wah when they announce ah that bubble tea closing wah jialat I already like stress eh cause like how I don't know how long they reopening what then I tried to find like other ways that I can like sub to my bubble tea wah nothing beats to it eh legit I then I just wah keep thinking of it pastu bila dia dah buka nak beli tengok queue dia tak apa ah kirim salam you leh do you drink bubble tea
eh tu sedap seh ya actually kan aku nak sub tu untuk aku punya bubble tea tau bila circuit breaker then wah jialat that one also close everything close then I don't know what to drink anymore then I think ah the circuit breaker ah was like diet to me
you buy the which one I heard the paling trend nya kan is the colour pink tu
yang pearls dia colour pink then when you go Playmade what you drink sia
eh abeh kalau compare kan semua bubble tea kan kau rasa mana satu yang paling mahal
tak eh sedap tak
oh abeh entah eh aku macam nak beli pun macam berat hati seh mahal seh uh abeh kat sekolah kau aku selalu dengar dari sekolah kau orang selalu beli bubble tea sedap ke bubble tea dia
I don't know eh to be honest ah I don't really like my school food cause first day my I I I know your school got like student price right my school standard price leh for public also then it's quite pricey then also ah not a lot of halal food then want find halal food cannot really find anywhere then maybe hmm like can only eat like McDonald's like that one easy ah halal but if you go food court that all ah quite difficult then hari hari makan nasi ayam ah then don't know eh got try my school food before
wah jialat I tell you ah wah if can ah I want buy roller blade sia it's damn far it's like my school is one end to the other end cause last time ah dengar dengar ah dorang kata my sekolah building burn down so dorang nak reclaim dorang letak at a new place ah so dorang letak new place tu dorang letak kat belakang then wah punya lah jauh like katakan eh you thought ah you thought you reach school early but wah you still reach class late but luckily my class got fifteen minutes grace so like okay lah can still use that fifteen minutes to jalan jalan your school leh your school so spaced out seh it's not besar but I think it's quite spaced out not far meh from one class to the other
but your school ah a bit weird leh cause like if see from in front ah quite small padan ah got behind behind some more quite complicated leh don't know how you can like learn how to find your way around
eh but right I know your school ah a lot of people just go there wah say only ah study always tell parents study but actually they don't really study one ah confirm like only merayap here merayap there then walk here walk there only you irritated or not
eh but sekerang tengah COVID ni tak ada orang kick you out ke you still can study at school meh
hmm but okay lah at least not like a lot of student now so so a bit better you all still got a bit more space then some more ah COVID now also you all kena separated must sit far far apart right
eh how your nenek ah like she cannot go out she at home only ah
wah not bad ah your nenek can know how to use this atas atas app
okay okay no wonder I was about to like wah so atas this one nenek modern is it then like your other family member leh they go out they work from home or go out also
hmm so like that nobody at home your nenek find more chance to keluar lah
then do you prefer her lama one or sekarang one
hmm then favourite makanan like masakan dia what for you
hmm then kau often tak tolong dia kat dalam dapur
but tak salah your area semua dekat dekat jer kan
oh abeh usually you all walk or like what
hmm but okay lah at least you with your nenek is it then you got friend then you can talk talk like that
hmm then wah did you miss your nenek cooking when you go school or what
dan hari ni kita akan berbual tentang anything under the sun
school sekolah
super senang apa lagi
like is it fun ada kawan-kawan ke tak
abeh kau punya time table like how is your
is it banyak time untuk relax atau tak
abeh pukul berapa what like what time is your lesson
oh ya I saw like I always see your Instagram like kau macam penat gila because you always like
abeh aku wave at you and you literally didn't you ignored me bro I was so sad
no aku literally waved at you
embarrassed kan ya aku pun I felt so malu because of that
that time aku remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl pakai tudung exactly same as you
err I aku aku not mad at you aku mad at the situation because aku was so embarrassed aku malu gila I was down the block
I saw uh cause it was at night malam-malam so aku saw this lady
she was wearing her tudung and she was in the dark
wave paling besar di dalam dunia like literally like this
macam tak kena gitu situation gitu
ya so for me sekolah aku I think it's super senang to go to school because I don't have to take a bus
aku tengah flex right now ya
ya cause now my school kalau kau nak masuk kau nak kena ada dia punya card like the specific card
measures no uh no as in in terms of the zones like for your school kau ada zone like different different zones
yang colour biru merah orange
the only my school has mala at uh food court empat
ya tu pun
oh kita punya junior eh
oh dia makan mala
ya ya tapi kita boleh masuk ke tak
but the thing is mala at causeway point macam mahal gila
I don't know if it's mahal gila eh
no tapi um I told amira then I um err apa jaz
jaz she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause dia tak makan the daging semua the daging is a mistake
who eats the daging you just go for the
that doesn't count as daging that counts as one of those processed meat macam spam daging is like literally daging yang macam masak tu
of course it's gonna be mahal it's like duck meat err
remember duck meat punya ramen that we ate at the apa
I was asking my bapa cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like oh can I suggest then I was like oh can we eat at the ramen and then he was like err I'll think about it then we never eat
was it one of those like lemak
oh ya sebab kau punya stomach kan ada problem sekarang
kesian baby
uh sebab you're like a baby you can't like handle the full Samyang experience that sounds like a
macam like the gravy ah
I don't I don't get why you don't like the carbonara one carbonara one is literally like the best punya flavour
man aku baru makan Samyang on is it yesterday or two days ago
is it because you never leave it inside for a longer time because I like my Samyang to be like puffy what's the word macam like
oh I don't know why but semalam aku macam on a
university punya rush so I was like looking at all the
ya because I aku fikir uh I really don't have a choice but to like look through siapa lia punya boyfriend sekarang dekat kan
what was his his course ah or should I ask like lia to ask him about dia punya experience
ada banyak mm
dorang take in like
ya kau tak kau tak research ke
then lepas poly kau nak buat apa
you actually like oh so kau macam like committed ah in that sense okay
uh aku scared yang dorang tengah trying to convince you to spend more money by the way they say it
she ya you should just since kau ada connection might as well just take advantage of it ah
dekat singapore
kerja kat perth ah
jangan world ni dah dah start ni dah start dah start
tadi tadi macam like on a you're still on the ground tapi ni a bit like floating
you I thought your mum ada your mum kasi
or I thought she was the one yang ada attachment punya issues dengan kau
macam like my kawan elisa
dia pun like thinking of
yang half malay half chinese yang whose in my classmate
oh tu tahu okay um elisa dia selalu kata but to her ma yang oh
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her kakak is like big
so dia mak dia selalu like oh then I'll come with you lah macam gitu
cause mak dia is quite to tua lah ya
and she said it okay okay she did lah it wasn't kinda like show off show offy punya manner
so aku then I was like aku macam shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense lah because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people aku macam so intimidated
it's uh sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture lah our punya course punya culture like no one is like
we're like so sikit
punya orang if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
kau punya course banyak orang y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
tak tahu err but I think she's still going for the
apa macam plan like have like one whole like plan for like dorang punya rest of their lives
after poly dorang gi university then after that apa kerja sikit then
so like whenever I'm with her aku macam like intimidated sikit ah sebab aku selalu kan aku ada going with the flow punya attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do lah I think it's my intern lah you were right what you were saying apa
kau punya comment lah like huda I'm so proud of you
pergi overseas
tapi dia like pandai enough to go for local uni ah so I'm not too worried about her
uh I think her overseas dream is untuk like
like kerja sana
ya sebab dorang ada minimum wage semua
I mean kau ada
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest semua the
ya I think the realisation that kita macam like growing up just like hits
oh sebab ada dina
ah foundation or whatever tak tahu
I want to learn more about like apa
aku nak belajar more about macam like social work gitu
when I went for my intern I really like felt macam like left uh not left out lah I just felt
not in the social work ah kan aku bilang kau social service organisations semua
tu like in the
kalau all fails I I can be like a teacher kau pun nak jadi teacher
cikgu kan
cikgu aliah
I mean like aku aku knew that I had like interest in like
kerja for like the community gitu like I like to give back to the society gitu because like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like macam boring and like
I really like at the end of the day aku macam like
macam apa haziq
haziq dia pergi apa kau tahu yang internship yang international
but then sebab
the overseas punya internship it was supposed to be overseas
ah tak tahu pula
ya tapi sebab dia kan like
dia he okay okay so
I know kau kind of like sceptical pasal dia punya like wealth
tapi uh elisa like dia explain to aku like dia punya how
in this like manner maybe kau macam like believe
so dia millionaire sebab
he would like his family would like invest in like oil punya stocks
apa return investment I'm like aku macam like a terrible
hundred thousand which should like deduct to be like sekarang kau believe tak
ni ni on like um oil
dorang kaya dorang like old money
cause sebab uh apa
on last friday tu aku I had to do like a sharing
sharer there who's like an punya student tapi haziq was there also and I'm like ugh
ah nanti aku show kau I was like talking about pe
you know aku pulled out all the I pulled out all the cards macam
and then he also talking about his internship ah tapi really kesian dia lah dia macam kau
apa cause about COVID then he had to like
come back to singapore gitu
kau cancelled immediately sebab was like in a mess
tapi this one was like indonesia was still like okay lah singapore indonesia boleh pergi because it was like in the same like circumference
so they ah pergi lah but then
after that they were like err this is worst than we expected you have to come back then gitu
because your one is apa macam tourist punya management so you you had to like have people there
this one was like business so everything could have been done online lah so it semua makes sense ah I'm
be tapi aku didn't like expect there's like oh
kau nak cakap pasal addison rae
I think that's like her brand lah that's macam apa jojo siwa
oh ya allah
then kau jangan kau jangan tengok video dia lah it's like she's not forcing you to watch her video
like I saw dia buat yang makeup punya video yang dia buat like clown
tak tahu lah
tak tahu lah I just see jer
wait aku Google avani net worth sekarang
oh dia tu takde like takde dia punya it
whoa kau kau memang critical of her eh
she's ni budak kecil
ya allah you're too critical of this show eh
dah kau punya addison rae punya sharing dah habis
would I love to talk to her but if I know like aku someone sikit
like dia he can talk lah
so but james sekarang kan dia ada banyak like years of experience sebab dia kan he was like he was the cover girl
he was the first like male punya cover girl so he went for a lot of apa talk shows dengan ellen semua
you know so kau you need to like be like
baik like kinder to them sikit lah please
tapi dorang famous
kau nampak yang TikTok punya
coffee punya tu manis oi and I was like seeing like four pumps of like mocha you know you saw that one
I aku aku bilang kau kan yang coffee kadang kasi aku macam anxiety so aku macam aku sangat
it's like I think uh cause I think aku ada break from coffee sebab I was like
kat rumah the whole time so I didn't like really was like
then after that uh I think a couple of weeks ago when I texted you was the first macam like
time minum coffee then aku my anxiety was like I had like I was so anxious
and then suddenly aku macam like so like scared
that day aku minum coffee day lah because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
macam you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
sekarang aku really cannot minum coffee again
which is sedih cause I love the taste of coffee you know how much I love like the taste of coffee
was it because of anxiety or apa
kau bodoh eh that's like the worst
kau macam better lah so
tapi tak pernah pass out
the day you actually pass out then you're like oh huda aku pass out I'll be like
kau nak pass out kan pass out lah
I guess now sebab aku tak boleh minum coffee then it should be easier for both of us ah so whenever Starbucks ada one for one I will never ask you
best punya
because uh aku try the LiHO punya pun
um it just doesn't hit as much as Sharetea punya oo
the matcha doughnut yang aku beli that day
it was so sedap sebab aku popped it in the microwave for like ten seconds it
but I bought also the mochi punya dough the like circle circle tu
uh mochi okay aku Google eh sebab uh kau tahu newt dari TikTok
oo sedap oi
and I was like aku expected it to be sedap ah
yang Dunkin' Donuts tu
aku I was feeling it cause these days I really love like sweets yesterday aku beli apa crepe
punya cake kau pernah rasa crepe cake
uh kat it was one of those like
halal punya baker
bukan Chateraise um one of those like malay punya J&C ke entah apa
bukan J&C it was one of the
uh so ya I I really like love sweets these days sebab mm aku kan manis

ya ya the ice cream semua they had that

I know it's obvious yang kau tak suka dia from the day one kau tak suka dia
to apa
the first so like the first time can you nampak dina
I think sebab it just
kesian sia
okay kau cakap dengar dengar aku tengah dengar ni
breaded tak
impulse like impulse tu
salvage dia punya
dia reply aku
dia tengah salvage
aku relieved ah yang dia tak ada grudge to aku cause I really like
err I feel aku rasa macam like
um maybe sekarang sebab ada pandemic there's a bit too much businesses but
orang yang suka baking then they sell like those
I'm aku kan bilang kau aku aku dah orang manis so I need to consume err manis
but I like apa my favourite treats are like
I like dia punya frosting punya flavour that's all I like I don't like macam like simple like chocolate rice gitu
aku uh aku uh aku a complicated girl
so rishi was like talking about it semalam
I would feel sedih also
of course korang best korang best friend
ya dia date untuk
like she wants them to act way more mature for their age dia ada dia punya expectations
terlalu high
and she's she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when apa dorang kat poly ke serving
you know kita tengah sekolah
is it sebab dia desperate to like
can like also get out of the house or something sebab dia punya environment very like toxic sikit
kau tengah give off love
ya tapi he can't he can't help it pe
and safirah couldn't help but falling for him at least sekarang dia over him lah but now she has this guy
hais kesian dia
belum lah that's why I put it inside the laundry punya basket
uh I would put it inside the washing machine then I would tu ya wash
uh bila aku ada bibik uh when I was bila aku kecil
and that's because sebab dulu like basuh basuh basuh basuh so it's like
but sekarang we do it on our own lah
and then I had the bibik to take care of my moyang
actually sekarang so far
I mean being in army like a lot of things already sudah restricted so
naturally we all sudah tak boleh keluar tak boleh go see our friends and all that so weekdays all aku pun tak free then
you know follow so that you know sekarang tak tak dapat saman kan ya
oh ya now is like the limit is wait is it still five or sekarang sudah buat sepuluh orang is it
actually if I'm not wrong now kalau wedding kan then we can have up to fifty people right
oh so sekarang means ikut shift ah dia punya macam wedding or like
oh cause from what I know is like next week I have a jemputan
cause from what they told me is that now only I think about lima puluh
the table sudah nak kena be err separated
kat your instagram story right pasal err the new system
you get certain score and all that then doesn't make you eligible to masuk like
if you understand then you can explain a bit lah macam
err cause both of us are going off field and all that then kat dalam hutan
sudah lah tak ada signal tak ada handphone pula
tak akan nak check news kan I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
just give me the opportunity to jumpa new people to interact more with err
tak wasted lah ya I really get to use it to
kalau if you ask me personally whether I would
give back more to the masyarakat
right I mean aku masih muda lagi
then what are the things like uh kau guys kau buat
what's the activities yang kau suka buat like say on a weekend lah ya
maybe go to the beach pergi jogging ke
okay pergi makan
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you masuk camp
I think that's the one oh when my mum masak you know
like what my family suka buat kalau on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is err bila everyone is
my adik and my mum they're free
err walking or cycling lah just around the area cause I stay err dekat dengan apa tu east coast
so kalau nak pergi beach pun err tak jauh sangat
kalau hujan lebat then okay lah that's when
make it like seimbang you know err just have a balance
kalau weekends you think about it you only have dua puluh empat jam
timing yang kita ada is definitely limited
kalau anything about pun I'm not so afraid to just bilang dia orang ah
eh last time dulu aku papa pun buat ini buat ini like last
ah dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena march and don't know what
wait I I was also enlisted in tekong so jadi
my family also ikut pergi sampai tekong and then they all
mum and dad adik and my eh my adik
and my nenek my err makcik
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course lah kalau first day kan
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so dia orang give the best food lah that they have
then ah I remember that day wah boleh nangis seh
ah rindu lah haven't been so
all nyanyi-nyanyi right all bising-bising
no ours was ours dua belas I think
macam total check my financial spending ah and really pen down pen and paper what
think about it err the duit that I
err set aside for macam macam transport kan
then after that kalau transport there and back cause I don't know selalu aku take grab lah
err careful with the where you spend the duit lah
start menjimatkan wang lah uh especially now that
beli mcdonald's beli what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow lah at the start then can go out beli baju kan
now err sebab all got the macam mana nak cakap the elections kan
cause err kalau you look at it right now
some of them like kasihan juga lah you look at them then they're like if they end up
err just buang all their duit during cause they ya our seniors ah
all buang their duit during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
and really err how to say err jaga your own money
I think for me like what you asked just now right uh tadi you said
cause definitely I really don't want to bebankan my parents financially lah and most of the
kalau extend contract kan jadi sampai cause
the idea is that err kalau we stay longer kat dalam camp
tapi mm tak tak sedap sangat
I mean tak it's not that bad
like uh tak jadi beban to your parents ah
tapi now
okay tapi now I feel like ya let's just talk about makanan ah really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like eh you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily lapar or anything
tapi it's just a excuse for me to like
err jumpa kawan jumpa family
err eratkan silaturahim lah with people people that
like you say asalkan halal I'm steady lah
a'ah eh kampung food aiya nevermind lah bro
apa kalau kau beli rendang right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know ah I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is sotong
so you you buy sotong that time
bulan puasa then my family pergi geylang kan nak makan
nak okay not makan sorry nak beli untuk buka lauk ah
standard ah you'll pack away take away lauk right
call that err sotong right the
sotong hitam sotong hitam that was the big squid then it was like what
in my opinion ya sebab kalau lapar kan a quick fix
ya then sebab it's convenient
err stand in one row right then semua beli maggi then tambah telur
then the telur selalu macam tak masak apa the aunty will say eh setengah masak but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just kacau everything then makan terus
encik tan encik tan bro that's like the go to nasi
then after that it naik sampai berapa eh
sampai tujuh puluh lapan bro
there is no way right kau boleh belajar and study at the same time
ya is ya oh sorry makan dan belajar at the same time sorry
so jadi we had to make do with what we had then
usually kita beli what err just nasi campur
or the india punya makanan ah
what we had was what err nasi padang right
nasi padang and the asagani stall
oh do you remember when err dulu
when we used to beli the nasi goreng first right then we just ask eh ada nasi kway
cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng then she'll be like
eh ada ada okay okay err jangan bilang orang then we
suddenly it's like everyone knew what nasi goreng was
honestly it was I think it was a different type of nasi goreng I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no nasi goreng that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
hey it was a super spicy nasi goreng
bulan puasa bro
okay bukannya susah sangat
betul betul okay understand
I try to masak lah sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got oh actually I won't say it's masak but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was eh that time remember bulan puasa
I made err err suji for everyone
because tak boleh agak how much err ramuan you need right
and all the sukatan-sukatan all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time buat then they say eh
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny suji right
then sudah sudah sudah habis buat then dia punya what you call that
when I made the err the whole aduan right it was a bit
so when I tried to make kuih for the first time that's what happened ah then the suji came out
I stay in the east area then this amshar pula tinggal kat
apa woodlands kan jauh gila so obviously
nak naik train pun I took like one and the half hours so
wah memang but that day sempat lah
sempat sempat balik bedok by buka seh
cause I left quite late I remember oh then I stopped by ang mo kio I wanted to meet tok mat to pass him the suji then he gave me another whole
um what you call that a whole container of kuih tart in return so
what was it ah it was oh hari raya oh I was I had leave
ya is no bro is the eve of raya bro
eh tak boleh ah I got interview then I was like oh okay lah then I go to your house ah
nasib baik I remember where you stay sia
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit kekok but but why did the the baking thing was that
suji for myself it's just dah
tak masuk akal lah for me to eat everything oh what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two sudah a bit muak sikit kan
let's say kalau I'm outside kan then I see people macam
need help especially older people naik naik bus that kind of thing then angkat the bag all like go inside right
paiseh kan because if you think about it eh ah memandai jer nak tolong
then err obviously she understands that aku pun nak she understands that aku pun nak tolong dia kan
kalau the makanan kan is halal right it will be less
but then err aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang right
ya ambil hati also then they also tak nak
eh actually I feel bad macam I I don't I
ah kari asam pedas bro that that nestle ice cream container got asam pedas
but tapi kalau you
ya but then err the my other halal option is uh mamak lah
mamak stall lah bro supper club
ah infomercials that's why there's kalau kau tengok jamaah kan one suria and all that
so obvious eh like eh ah abang
err susu biasa lah tak payah pakai
ha ha I think I see this most often about my nenek lah
ya they they I mean in general my nenek cooks everyday
for for starters my nenek is quite open to all this also
kan ada tetamu datang obviously you have to prepare something right for them
but because we sudah bawa makan
ya tak payah susah sangat
you know we used to beli ah sweet talk semua kat bawah block kan
ya only if you use like special discount ke
okay kalau sudah ada kahwin okay sudah kahwin pun boleh lah
ya masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak maggi
I saw your posting bro not bad ah kau dengan kau punya baju suit semua very classy eh not bad eh
berapa lama kau kerja sana ah
ye ke tapi aku dengar dorang cakap saudi arabia is a very corrupted country tau
cause ya I saw a lot of news right especially the the prince kan the prince sulaiman he a lot of controversies about him and then you know now his his other neighbouring countries the arab countries ah have a lot of war and then his ties with the america nya
arab countries but anyway I mean I think this is too much of a politic abeh kau bila kau kat saudi arabia selain solat kau buat apa sana
oh so if you were given another chance kau will travel saudi arabia or would you like to try negeri lain
so speaking of football kan abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah stop macam kita orang juga
ah negara luar macam messi ronaldo ni semua kan dorang masih main ke or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
tapi sementara jer bro cause ah
kalau kau tengok betul-betul eh sekarang kau tengok electric punya tariff dah naik nine point three per cent abeh so I think the government will first
for for them lah but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa ninja van eh
oh savings eh tapi slowly your savings will also
jadi kurang kan abeh kau tak worry ah
tak bro that one was just uh interview that I went to went for
um not bad lah you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not aku just try to continue so for now aku just uh aku kerja as a clinic assistant ah
which is quite tough ah banyak patients and
you know banyak demands
the protected gear ah eh and then uh quite safe ah kau kau kalau ikut all the safety protocols ah everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved ah I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since aku tak pernah ambil semua seh so aku maybe ah my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
mm kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun there's a lot of a
uh and it's been a growing trend ah I see a lot of uh races actually uh branching into this line cause selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja grab food pun ye lah orang-orang kita kan betul tak
tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja at least gaji aku eh aku at least rasa kena at least two point five and above ah itu pun depends kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja normal is quite risky ah kalau kau kerja macam
err gaji yang one K plus jer unless if you only living with your wife
mm that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays ah you know our generations especially tapi if you were to think about it
know the traditions tu yang susah tu the culture of our our race kan kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves abeh macam mana seh nak sustain kalau ada anak semua kan nak kena bayar bill
bayar susu diapers semua I mean of course definitely they they you know dapat baby bonus ni semua tapi berapa lama seh boleh tahan
tak boleh tahan kan aku rasa
ya but singapore pun
I mean kau kena faham-faham ah singapore dorang akan kasi kau grants for free nya apa
err like sekarang kau tengok dorang dah increase traffic eh electricity nya price nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik so but I mean the government they are doing their best lah I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country kan to remain at the top
abeh no choice ah
government I think government will try their best lah but we we still have to find ways ah no matter what aku rasa
kita kena hustle ah this is a hustling years lah just like macam dulu ah time SARS zaman SARS dulu pun dorang
economy pun jatuh tapi kau tengok slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves ah we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it ah orang cakap
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing dah berapa jer
tapi personally aku tak tahu ah aku rasa
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body ah mentally physically aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak exercise tak you know take their time to you know relax to ease off kalau tak
kau pun boleh terjejas ah kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk ah
macam lagi ramai orang I mean dorang dorang memang susah pe so I think macam aku nak cakap dorang dah get used to it lah abeh tapi I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
uh wealthily macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini kan then dorang macam terus jadi stress sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini kan
dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah so dorang might know what to do or might hustle even like normally ah they do like hustle really hard tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja
high position semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh survive kan gini so that's why dorang stress kan
and then we have to fight through ah and speaking of which kan berbual pasal COVID aku recently baca news trump kena COVID is it true
aku tengok ah siol tapi the thing is kenapa china buat macam gini eh I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions macam I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
apa ni world
organisations eh yang the one with apa united nations is it
dorang pun are against it tau abeh aku tak faham kenapa they are still doing this eh but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care ah aku just buat ni tak ada orang boleh stop aku
so even though aku might say that I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china kan aku might side with trump ah just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims kan
then aku rasa it's it's it's really cruel ah but I don't know why kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini eh
which are aku rasa it's just too much ah to be honest this is just like macam zaman-zaman dulu seh if kalau kau belajar history kat secondary school semua kan kalau kau belajar kau tengok ah hitler kau tengok macam orang macam um stalin of what they have done
so it's aku rasa it's just it's just effed up ah aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak ah aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman serious
sebab setahu aku eh
the black err civil rights activist ni semua they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people macam
aku rasa tak tahu eh macam
that's what I heard also ah macam apa ni dia ada counterfeit nya duit kan
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police dekat america is being
ah so kalau aku rasa kalau kau as an american kan kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu ah macam mana
aku tak aku tak imagine kalau this situation were to happen in singapore
kita sikit jer dah riot dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu country
apa lagi kalau legit kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau witness kita nya own singapore police buat gini confirm kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap
ah aku rasa
I think it memang exist ah aku rasa the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism ah it it will happen in all countries in all places and aku rasa that's why the government
tapi nak buat macam mana kalau government tak tekun dengan dia punya laws semua kan tak tak really ah
be serious about this then aku rasa kita nya country
will be like other countries ah I mean let's just look at our neighbour ah malaysia kau tahu malaysia sendiri kalau
okay aku sendiri melayu kan aku tak nak cakap
tapi aku rasa the malay rights over there it's
it's belittling the other races ah tak tahu ah aku rasa dari malaysia
so kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata kan aku cina eh abeh aku nak beli rumah aku malaysia citizen tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar extra mahal sebab aku cina
eh a'ah betul juga eh
macam dorang tak bersyukur eh macam apa dorang dapat
that's what aku personally see lah or feel bila aku when aku tengok kat news
err videos on the internet what what kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak
and it's sad to see ah tapi aku tak faham ah kenapa najib dia dia dah kena tangkap kan aku dengar dia dapat confirm he's dia dah found guilty kan
it's just so chaotic macam tak ada orang control seh macam those pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah parliament lain
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what aku tak faham ah macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa seh macam
boleh dorang ada orang macam gini to represent eh
mm aku pun nampak ni dekat facebook or youtube ah
but ah I think it's on twitter tapi how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
but aku aku really wonder how
ah recruitment and the position that is of power ah macam ni semua position important important seh abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh just get away with all these things
if you were given a choice eh kau will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
the money money wise I think what I would do aku would probably kerja kat singapore
tapi um
tapi aku would live there so aku can know have a lot of make a lot of more money ah abeh aku boleh spend
ah tu eh that's true eh aku rasa I mean
tapi if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position ah which you have to climb eventually
aku rasa it's all about
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever tapi
ah currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can uh I think it's more important for me to focus on myself ah sia I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend abeh aku tak boleh sustain mata air aku
then teruk ah puas hati aku ada banyak duit then aku boleh ada girlfriend then aku boleh you know
kita dua-dua boleh enjoy
tapi ya lah
then what kau kau ada mata air
know we we may not kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga
people who are happily in the relationship together they dorang macam relax jer tak post apa-apa just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily ah
to tengok orang macam gini semua kan I think ada segelintir ah mungkin dorang macam rasa the same thing tapi
ada juga ah golongan yang you know uh having good relationships ah so aku rasa kau should give a try tapi ye lah likewise you know aku rasa sekarang tengah susah kan so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself ah
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever tapi
for my race but entah aku rasa macam
tak boleh ah kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap
you know tunjuk yang kita boleh lead anak orang betul tak
tapi no choice ah this is how
we uh most parents are dealing with their child cause kita pun nak kena survive pe nak cari duit it's all about money ah singapore is all about being financially stable ah and that sacrifice have to be made ah kalau kau nak
so aku rasa that's why some cultures they
abeh uh
abeh macam uh
dah terpaksa ah aku rasa it's dah macam
dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita ah sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah so
that's why aku rasa financial planning is very important kita kena plan sekarang before having a kid you know not just funfair buat lepas tu at last kita susah then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu
and to have a beautiful family ah tu aku rasa ah um yup
on your end kau rasa apa
kau ambil train ke kau ambil
bro jangan kuat sangat
ya tak aku ingat kau jalan dengan kat sini
aku mimpi aku pregnant babe then the mimpi was so real is like macam kau tahu bila kau tengah give birth
ya I can feel the pain it's sakit gila babe
ya habis baby tu keluar babe I I don't know who is the father also but ya itu jer lah mimpi aku
err nobody ah it's just me and the baby and some other people that aku tak kenal
dia macam baby biasa I guess like anak perempuan habis cute tapi nakal ah habis dia minta susu dengan aku selalu
no leh it's more of like I have to jaga this baby
ya aku memang mimpi pasal baby banyak ah aku tak tahu apa pasal but in real life aku memang macam tak nak anak ah
mm ya lor but then aku suka budak-budak apa and I like to spend time with them but I don't know right ya yes
cause aku dulu suka buat macam that kind of like diary entry like from that year or whatever
very like ya reflective and macam gini
all right lah yang benda-benda bodoh ah macam
aku rasa aku masih dengan azee seh
so aku aku just dengan kawan aku aku remember ya about her and then like
ya lor but then um ya aku rasa
like are you still friends with that girl the kawan aku kan uh but like
but dulu sec four kau ada macam mimpi-mimpi eh impian-impian ke
see lah my english all berterabur already
mm I think very small things like kalau
orang tu macam tak text aku balik or what I think aku fikir yang bukan-bukan but then I aku macam don't act on it lah but sometimes I'll I'll be
even though you think maybe it's something personal but kau try to
a'ah satu hari tu kat bus aku tak tahu kalau kau ingat ke tak aku tweet pasal perempuan ni kat bus habis dia macam
tak nak jalan babe dia macam tak nak give aku way habis
in the end like dia tak nak duduk dia tak nak duduk tak apa tapi banyak seats kat belakang then bila banyak seats kat belakang aku geram lah macam apasal kau tak nak kasi aku jalan eh
and then me being passive aggressive aku macam
okay lah tak apa ah aku just diri habis aku jeling-jeling kat dia
then terus bila orang turun dia duduk dekat depan babe
at last dia duduk so pun tak apa
aku tak tahu maybe around like younger than me
she saw me she saw me and then dia macam nak buat macam you know muka yang macam
mm step tak nampak aku gitu
aku stare dia seh aku dah macam minah red aku dah keluar habis
habis what about you
aku rasa macam you're the least petty person ever
or like me zaman dulu lah because
ya ya bila aku dengan zee I mean like this girl nama apa eh nama dia apa eh aku lupa tapi dia kawan zee
then this girl dia macam tak nak tegur aku tak nak say hi even though I said hi to her so I don't know her personally what right
exactly it's because dia cakap ah apa ni aku date zee that's the reason why she don't like me even though I'm julie's friend
nasib baik buat apa call aku eh
dah lah it's okay lah don't have the red one lah
but then ex kau yang lagi satu
okay but if if I were to choose I think aku nak macam to be able to speak

allowance berapa lama ni
sixteen seconds bodoh bagus
siapa seh aku nak jadi I'm already an actor myself in real life I think normal

like you wake up as them but you're still yourself rabak though then suddenly I can speak malay
that will make the news you know wah stray kids can speak malay one tiba-tiba
like tak payah pergi kerja ah

and he went to korea without like any money or anything so macam
and he tak even go for like classes to belajar you know he just like
if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle dia orang punya
if you ikut macam the business like module
ya the food punya
itu jer
macam you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
ambil and try
tak bagi like anybody just masuk tahu so you have to like

and then we all will mati together
I don't know macam as we grow older I guess
what the world is then we get macam
aku lagi penat daripada kau you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
ya pasal lah penat
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film penat sia
there's this macam
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which mazhab you're looking at also
pasal if you're talking about
like kita punya mazhab memang we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
there's other mazhab that's like
like this idea of mazhab is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
that's like my question because the mazhab thing came about because of
macam concerns lah
then is the mazhab thing going to change or what
a set in stone thing cause the mazhab thing was never like set in stone
people there might adopt our mazhab punya practices

not working um working lah working from home ah err kira work from home
um ya lah basically macam bake cake ah kebanyakan bake cakes
then err lagi macam jual baju ada jual baju juga um
jual baju is on facebook live you've seen that facebook live before right ya so
I do like baking habis baking is like when people want to order from me they can just
contact me ah dekat instagram or carousell they can find me there and then
wait for them I will make lah pasal sometimes because I'm also like working part time as well like juggling three jobs at the same time oh my god
as of now sekarang ah I prefer baju jual baju
sebab um
baking and then macam very penat it's very tiring ah very tiring then I need err actual like
okay lah so I need actual kitchen dia macam tempat pun tak ada then
I love baking I still love baking but inshallah like in the future kalau if I have err a kitchen space then I maybe will continue back my baking is not I stop baking lah I'm still baking lah it just that now only once a month twice a months
will will apa maju english
um for now kan I sell facebook live sahaja kan so in the future I will do mostly like um okay how to I like attract more customer is it
live won't die off but if it does die off kalau dia die off kan um I already dah macam ada my customer base I already have I dah ada so even if the facebook live die off they can come over to my shop they already know my name my name is well known ready
I know which right now currently sekarang tiktok is doing it
tiktok has a live um ya tapi for one thousand followers and above
not in the future during the future I think it will apa banyak orang akan jual barang dekat tiktok
but ya the part ah the part where you said um body body builders pakai instagram is tadi cakap
actually it's true you know because I I don't know why I think it was back I was like really into those yang bikin body bikin body
ya kalau beli phone baru pun is better I feel like beli phone can buy camera apa camera yang good quality
that's why I also like planning to buy new phone juga with a good quality camera on the phone which I do not know tapi I kena find out lah
oh oh it got contract or just the phone itself oh oh I dengan contract I ada contract
no what I want to err what err err a a phone with camera sebab kan I cakap I ada facebook live kan
so I can take pictures of my clothes take good quality I mean sekarang I can use my phone to take good quality ah but it's not good quality it is just a picture which is nice but it's not a good quality picture
okay but my one I have no problem sekarang sebab I have microphone I have microphone
what sekarang my camera quality for me macam tak apa uh not bad okay cuma kena ada good wi-fi
connection if wi-fi connection is not good dia akan
so that's why sometime you see my video will be like macam err a bit not good quality sebab wi-fi connection wi-fi connection is important
like that is apa kena pakai wi-fi connection more daripada mobile data kalau mobile data bila pakai dia lagi rabak dia punya lagging
benda-benda yang I tak tahu I pun tengok youtube juga ya so macam ya because so come back to youtube juga of course tapi macam mana eh you nak jual baju dekat youtube
tapi I nak phone baru mainly sebab I nak ambil gambar of this baju yang I ada okay I'm not concerned about
the live punya video
apa live video quality I'm not concerned about that that much sebab so far all the phone kalau yang rabak pun dia punya quality is very good I'm concerned about pictures that coming out and gonna post it on my facebook
no lighting is a need as well tapi I really have lighting okay I already have lighting I just need to learn more
eye to see which one is nice which one is not ah you sendiri have to tengok sendiri lah mana satu yang cantik mana satu tak for free
you ingat photoshop senang you ingat photoshop senang
tak kenapa you cakap dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
kenapa you berbual dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
you talking to someone yang belajar photoshop so why you saying that guy that way
yang mop canteen mop canteen
you know what reminds me of my sekolah time sunrise sunrise sunrise kan a'ah sunrise
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well um sapu
lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci all the pan pots all wash
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then jap when you cakap macam gitu teringat macam oh okay macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu
know the rubbish bin all that right err so kita again ah upper aside those ya not so basically we will most of the time we will ask like
um everyday we have our own leader you know everyday we have you know like if if if apa ni primary school ke secondary school prefect prefect secondary school
eh secondary pun ada eh
so like prefect kan macam everyday kita ada prefect dekat sekolah tu walaupun it's already a a
ikut dia punya register number something like that so it's not loser basically this person do right is like everyday dia akan assign like
okay the four of you will do the pots and pans the four of you will mop the four of you will do this ataupun okay the four of you will collect the ingredients the flour and put on top okay the four of you
there's a term for that we don't call monitor or president other term other term I lupa apa chef entah apa chef I lupa but I hate it when it comes to my turn
no I'm not I'm the most macam no um the most shy because like in the morning I have to be talking to all of them like as if like I'm the leader sia I have to talk like okay I'm the leader you guys have to listen to me I'm not that kind of person what I'm not
so macam bila part I jer macam macam mana ah macam mana ah everytime is my turn I will be like ah shit I'm so scared I'm so scared I will get like anxiety macam
panic uh macam mana macam mana but the hal is everytime dah dapat tau everytime dah dapat because it rotates what
even if I don't want to lead then I'll be like macam on lah very on very kiasu you know
tapi kan macam ini macam tak ada pilihan langsung everyday orang rotate orang yang ada yang lagi pemalu daripada I
yang very shy super timid ada that one also like
but that we as a as the dia punya classmate tak ada macam
wah this one wah rabak sia cannot sia cannot sia we don't kita akan macam
for for example lah nama dia michelle eh michelle we would encourage her would be macam michelle it's okay you tell me what you want me to do you tell me I sitting beside you you tell me
ya time sekolah that's why I really love at sunrise you know at sunrise it's like the most amazing school I mean okay maybe the school is not really amazing tapi I punya classmate is the most amazing classmate ever so I macam happy gila
time secondary school primary school jangan cakap lah paling merepek
huh okay part buli in singapore is not that rabak hmm kalau buli in malaysia is the most rabak eh
okay lah let him be lah okay I don't know what happen to him now it's been years already hopefully okay dah berubah
I still feel so stupid you know I'm like I'm I'm staying at choa chu kang tapi asal I jauh
I apply something at balestier I do not know why got the other one at balestier and then suddenly balestier ni pindah for the second year pergi dekat yang college central
hujung sekali kalau kelas you hujung sekali your canteen is hujung sini
to my defense I didn't know sebab bila I uh apa apply for this sekolah dia orang cakap oh this diploma is recognisable everywhere in singapore outside of singapore is recognisable wah but when apply kerja horrible
no they do not recognise ah apa private diploma singapore don't recognise private diploma even kawan-kawan I yang kerja
eh yang
yang apa yang M yang macam you know is private juga kan ataupun apa
entah lah that one private also kan that one also not recognise tau sebab private
tapi is like quite the amount is so much for a private but then end up you don't use my for you you korang bagi kerja korang tak nak accept
takde lah
takde lah culinary job is I understand
so I understand that part is like macam okay lah but then
so now you are saying like okay you do not know what is happening okay so I bilang
basically alah macam banyak job banyak jer orang yang tak ada kerja but I tak tahu lah maybe I'm looking at the wrong places mungkin my agents are not really good
no ya that's why like most of them macam I wanna leave singapore I don't want to stay at singapore or something but to live at singapore you need job honey
a'ah like dia cepat-cepat sangat dia progress
ah I'm grateful that we jadi ita tak ke belakang tau jadi kita tak ada slow
future kids you know future grandchildren you know dia orang akan dapat macam a lot of privileges lah and then same time makan maju lagi cepat dari kita lagi
pintar pintar eh wow bahasa melayu pintar is pintar is pandai lah ya I don't know tiba-tiba
ya lah nak pakai lah ni pandai okay pandai tapi
ya but I'm seriously like grateful lah sebab singapore macam very multiracial multiracial and then macam we don't we don't really have like racial discrimination amongst the
for me singapore job is ah ya ya a bit difficult for me to get singapore job sebab kena banyak mandarin mandarin kena banyak berbual mandarin then macam
hello mas apa khabar
it's okay macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana mm so what are your plans for this weekend
oh yes ahmad is there uh dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada uh think four or five kids
no lah it's okay ah rezeki masing-masing ah so are you not going out with your family today
like kesian kan
bagus lah tu boleh jaga anak-anak
bagus seh masak untuk husband all
ya but ni adalah satu uh precaution for us to take ya so kita perlu berhati-hati lah
so penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah jer
ya lah stress lah at work macam-macam
since it's the holidays kan banyak orang-orang datang uh visit museum
so kalau you nak datang dengan family nak kena datang on weekdays
uh weekend tak boleh lah pasal terlalu ramai
uh until nak queue under the hot sun pengsan pula
um tak ada lah semua kena queue macam biasa
ya so ya lah kind of sad pasal tengah holiday sekarang but we have nowhere to go
oh ya ya I've read about it but belum ada time lah to redeem tour voucher
oh I don't think ada
for kids ada tu vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
online ah so it's not that bad lah hundred dollars pun jadi lah kan
biasa lah singaporean bila yang dia orang tak complain
mm understand ya I think uh COVID nineteen ni menjejas banyak singaporean
then ya lah kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah ah nak pergi holiday pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu lah
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so pasal I think malaysia pun sekarang masih ada banyak case ah so it's still unstable lah
I think uh ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also ada bilang juga
ah no lah I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask pun can do its job lah
ya lah sekarang pun yang baru-baru case dekat tampines mall tu wah
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall terperanjat seh
uh so far tak ada pula case yang lain-lain
I mean yang in the community lah
ah because you will never know seh who yang ada penyakit ni then kita pun senang jangkit especially dengan macam
warga emas dengan kita punya parents nak kena jaga-jaga
ya I think baru semalam news uh that people are queuing over at mana eh
in place ah tapi kan from the look of the photos tak ada jer think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
ya lah that's where the christmas light up is lagi so this year has been a challenging year lah ah
ada bagus juga lah that you
tak ni lah but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to ke malaysia ke I think it's affecting business everywhere uh kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian kan
I think mm mana-mana affected
mm ya lah but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business ah cuma are required to have the mandatory swab test then uh like
tak payah lah so I I dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena swab test yang
uh kalau
kalau dibuat dengan betul tak lah rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru or trainee yang buat wah rasa lah pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali
ya I think I even my friend yang
ya actually quite kesian ah in this situation macam banyak orang ada family but
kena berhenti kerja business tutup
twenty twenty has been uh ya lah like I said a challenge lah untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan lah
measure steps ah I think which is quite good lah for all lah even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted tak boleh keluar ke apa but still it's for our own good lah
oh I do actually err I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like ah so he and his wife dah beli
ya but I don't know how berapa bagus yang reusable punya mask
tak lah because uh
bulan december err think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe nak ajak makan lah but
wah only can keluar um five lima orang sahaja
think kalau the atmosphere is different lah when you dining outside err dengan makan kat rumah kan
take care of ourselves lah think the celebration is is actually pasal kita nak kena
mm mana kita berhenti tadi
um ah awak
seorang baker awak suka masak apa
untuk family
pandai juga awak baking eh abeh kalau masak masak apa
oh untuk lah eh suami awak family awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal COVID ni
mm mungkin pasal orang dah stock up ke uh iya lah singaporean kan macam saya cakap kiasu dia orang suka benar simpan
oh beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi uh three or four packets for a family of
ya lah kesian yang orang-orang yang ya lah tak ada pendapatan mm tapi saya rasa ada juga restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
mm ya lah saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah lah mana dia orang pergi
mm betul tu uh there's a lot of platform yang go digital so I think uh everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop ah these are now necessities
ya I think uh a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can lah so it's best they do so lah during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected seh ya I think my friends either yang kena retrenched at an early age eh
ya kesian kan
I think dia tak akan take the swabber paying job lah pasal I think he has more kids at home kesian takut he'll be affected lah even though he'll be uh think
he has his reasons lah for not doing that kind even though it's uh gaji tinggi but still dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan uh
ya where should we go to makan what is your favourite food
yes the curry is uh sedap
ah ada yang baik tu boleh juga pakai app sekarang kan semua
wah see sekarang semua dah high tech
order makan pun boleh
ya at this point memang ah it's not
not right to be walking on their own tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah terexpose dengan COVID ni I think it will take masa yang panjang untuk dia orang to recover to get well ah kesian I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic kan macam I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya kesian kan
mm betul tu abeh lagi cause my parents are staying on their own kesian kan we don't get to meet them as much abeh ada some old folks tak tahu pakai smartphone so lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu so kesian dia orang so masa-masa gini lah kita patut berwaspada even though it's sad but we have to follow lah
ya lah yang generasi yang
lama mereka tak terexpose dengan internet macam kita sekarang so with this technology I think dia orang will
ah ambil masa untuk
so kesian so
macam makin kurang and there's less interaction human interaction
ya lah tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia and dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh
mm actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones lah yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya lah nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa lah
that's why it's uh important lah to untuk mereka um update dengan keep with the trend apa yang berlaku bukan jadi trendy lah cuma keep up with the times
mungkin juga lah tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga so mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat
um balik semula kehidupan yang normal
some dan hari raya
mm uh macam
kirakan contact is now minimal lah mm
sedih lah tapi macam mana
mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan lah setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya
iya lah pasal singaporean usually kalau holiday akan go overseas uh mm holiday uh tapi sekarang tengah
tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di singapore
oh bagus tu idea staycation
boleh juga awak dan family destress
mm okay lah ya lah macam saya cakap ini adalah
the new normal yang kita akan lalui tak tahu berapa lama lagi
harap bersabar sahaja lah kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua
oh itu safe distance ambassador
ah dia orang akan memerhatikan
okay lah ada yang volunteer ada yang dibayar gaji ni part of the
government agency yang united mm
mm tu lah saya pun perasan juga
tak lah mungkin mereka
berjalan-jalan untuk mencari orang yang melanggari peraturan lah tapi saya tak rasa dia orang boleh mengangkap dia orang boleh menasihat
uh dengar kata dan tak lawan peraturan-peraturan mm
oh tu mungkin dia orang volunteer daripada lain lain agency mungkin yang tak ada uniform tu mungkin
dalam bekerja lah untuk united
mm agaknya pakcik tu
uh tu dia orang tu dah nak hantar boleh lah

since we got a big family right ah okay lah kita ada car so
uh I want to have a baby lah at least kalau ada
stable punya ni
uh at least dah boleh ada anak
pasal ada anak banyak pakai duit nak beli pampers nak beli susu everything kan
ah so aku rasa
lebih baik uh
dah ada stable semua financial baru ada baby ah kalau tak stable nanti anak nak makan apa kan
takkan nak kebulur makan pasir eh ah jadi at least kalau kita dah ada duit ah at least we also
sebelum jadi richest pun kita nak kena pandai save duit
ah save duit you need to have plan about money ha
kalau kau dah plan ah semua jadi at least bila kau ada anak
nak hantar anak kau pergi sekolah sekarang sekolah bukan cheap eh
memang mahal lah mahal gila lah eh
lagi-lagi buku dia orang lagi baju sekolah apa semua ah abeh dia orang punya tambang pergi sekolah apa semua
abeh kau nak kena hantar apa semua unless kau nak belikan basikal ah untuk anak kau kan
basikal so suruh dia orang ajar dia orang macam mana nak kayuh basikal so at least they can
ah semua pasal duit okay lepas tu
lepas tu semua aku dah fikir fikir pasal ada anak semua aku dah fikir pasal future lah
ah then nombor tiga
aku fikir nak bawa family aku pergi holiday
mm pergi luar negeri lah pergi holiday ataupun aku pergi honeymoon sebab aku belum pergi honeymoon lagi kan
since daripada hari aku kahwin tu aku belum pergi honeymoon so that is why I'm thinking lah so at least
um dengan duit yang aku ada tu aku boleh bawa ah family aku pergi travel everything lah
tu yang aku fikir lah mm
so aku rasa yang paling penting sekali is
untuk ugh
rapatkan lagi silaturahim is dengan buat family gathering lah macam tu mm
oh that one I got heard from my mother-in-law yang pasal tu lah
my mother-in-law cakap lah yang dia dengar dekat warta berita kan since I kerja I pun tak ada time nak tengok warta berita kan
ah so bila my mother-in-law kasih tahu I macam
eh serious ah mak serious ah dapat
seratus dollar I thought is
seratus dollar in cash lah I was so happy ah sekali dia kata voucher
sekali you cakap dia orang pakai singpass lagi I cakap a'ah lah pakai singpass pula
ah that's why macam
boleh ke eh ah boleh ke tidak eh
apa yang kita tengok dekat warta berita dia orang kata tunggu lah dia orang announce kan
so kita tengok jer lah dia orang announce boleh pakai kat mana kat mana semua lah ah we just wait lah
so at least after dia orang dah announce kita boleh ni lah boleh discuss
maybe kita boleh buat vacation ke untuk kita punya ni lah
family buat family gathering like what I said lah
family gathering ke apa
kat singapore pun tak [pe] lah kan
since dia kata december baru dia keluarkan so about
then maybe from there we also can uh plan maybe buat january ke february ke

ah tengok lah kita nak book hotel ke kita nak book chalet ke apa ke
tak kisah lah resort ke whatsoever that we can book lah kan ah

um macam birthday party tu birthday event lah kita boleh buat event birthday party because
macam cousin kita kan uh birthday dia january then my husband punya is february kan
so uh why not kita buat end of uh january
dengan uh february pasal february first feb kan my husband punya birthday kan
ah so jadi kita dah buat ending january tu dengan first feb
at least dua hari satu ah satu malam
betul tak dua hari satu malam ah so kita boleh book so kita boleh celebrate both uh birthday
dia orang together kan ah so at least ah kita boleh ni ah bincang-bincang nanti plan dengan cousin kita macam mana
whether we want to book a resort ke
kita nak book chalet ke kita nak buat staycation ke ataupun kita nak sewa hotel ke
ataupun we also can plan want to picnic kat marina ke ah so at least
one day ke ataupun kita picnic jer kat situ sampai esok pagi so at least boleh
celebrate dua kat east coast ke west coast ke ah macam gitu lah kita celebrate ah
betul tak mm
overnight pun boleh picnic pun boleh lah kan lagipun kita semua
satu rumah what ah then yang lain dah kahwin yang yang kita nak ajak ni cousin dah kahwin ah so
it's okay since dia boleh bawa husband dia sekali ah
so maybe barang-barang yang kita beli kat daiso tu kita boleh buat sendiri lah tampal sendiri
tapi apa yang aku rasa lagi save is macam hari ni birthday our cousin kan then the next day birthday abang kan
my husband eh jadi you nak err buat macam mana jadi pukul dua belas
uh macam kita buat macam
uh eleven plus gitu nak dekat pukul dua belas so at least kita celebrate
satu kali jalan ah macam gitu kan so it's better right
so at least time kita celebrate okay uh kita dah
tiup tiup tiup oh okay okay lepas tu ah kira macam satu cake
ah then kita celebrate untuk hari ni dengan esok gitu
uh kita picnic kat west coast ke east coast ke
marina ke
err whatsoever lah payung besar sudah
actually right I got saw that time inside a website ah I not sure is it at west coast ke east coast
yang dia orang ada buka macam khemah besar tau
macam khemah kat dalam ada sofa ada macam I think it's sofa ya
dia orang buat uh ni
uh kira macam tempat murah-murah lah kat macam
yang kau boleh ni ah kira boleh chill chill dia orang cakap
sekali aku tengok eh
aku cakap eh not bad siak dalam ada ni eh
ah ni ah dia orang tengok ada table kecil aku tengok abeh lepas tu sofa
ah itu betul-betul khemah khemah macam khemah besar so if raining dia orang cakap kau tak payah risau
but uh morning I want to do some activity you know like rock climbing ke zipline ke if
abang to mm
but tak tahu lah eh tengok macam mana ah
nak buat apa seh
mm confirm like macam dah lah panas terik
ah lepas tu tengok-tengok binatang berpeluh-peluh lagi lepas tu ketiak semua nanti basah aduh
mak kan tengah sakit also right so
maybe dia orang akan bawa lah
takkan tak bawa kan gila tak bawa kan
dia orang pun kan tak boleh tak boleh hidup tanpa anak dia orang kan
confirm kalau shopping kita punya cousin
adik intan mesti memang suka suka gila shopping
especially kalau dia tengah ada duit dia memang suka shopping shopping tak habis-habis shopping baju baju baju
baju ah
so aku rasa
maybe lah kita just go with the yang pergi berkelah tu lah
lagipun kita dah lama seh tak pergi berkelah
a'ah seh picnic picnic picnic tak picnic picnic
but I think your abang
ah confirm dia cakap eh huh kenapa tak cakap siang-siang
ah akan save pe duit
then you can see pantai also ah
ya but I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
you feel like not bad right eh macam eh cantik pe view dia
eh why not I memang nak pergi
but I thought of going with your abang lah that time
kau tengok ah selalu jer kita busy busy busy macam
since dia kerja aku kerja
kan so tak ada time
then balik rumah pun buat kerja rumah
gedebak gedebuk semua ah so tak ada time lah
plan actually aku dengan abang kau macam macam tau plan
even aku
kita plan
nak buat rock climbing sama-sama ah
zipline ah ni semua
that's why I would like to ni lah cari
mana mana ah tempat yang ada kan activity macam gini
so at least kita boleh buat activity ni tak tahu kat mana yang ada activity ni
ah kallang memang ada
I got saw I got saw that time yang masih
aku pergi tengok wayang dengan kak faz kau kat kallang
after kak faz kau balik kerja tu
abeh aku cakap eh tak sangka seh rock climbing dekat dalam building ni then dia cakap
next time kalau bie nak join join ah dia cakap gitu so aku macam
oh serious ah aku pun macam
betul ke boleh join ni huh
dah macam tak ada confidence eh sekarang dah gemuk dulu badan macam mana kan ah
kalau dulu tak gemuk macam gini ah okay lah
aku pun tak tahu lah
hais makan makan makan malam aje makan lapar lapar lapar makan
so that when we lepak
kita boleh ni ah
makan makan makan ah sambil lepak tengok if I not wrong have
but if tak ada
kita still boleh lepak-lepak berbual-berbual sambil makan chips chips dia tak apa ah
kita beli chipsmore ke then kita beli chips ya lah chips biskut kan
ah yang cemil-cemilan ah
but serious ah kalau kita lepak macam gitu still nak buat pit ke
barbecue pit still nak buat barbecue pit
kita masak lah kan masak lepas tu bawa
since kita like what you say nak pergi petang kan ah okay lah
ah tempat sometimes especially weekend
so I think like kita nak kena book
uh ni cepat sikit
if not kita terlambat kita tak dapat lah tempat
maybe some of us ke siapa-siapa kita boleh pergi dulu so at least
tak kisah lah siapa sampai siang kan
kalau sampai siang at least kita ada tempat tau ada tempat
ah kita dah book untuk berapa orang
ah so at least dah ada orang tau
ah dekat tu tempat
jadi tak ada orang boleh ambil ah
ah then you say eh salah salah salah tempat ah macam gitu also cannot what
energetic ah gitu
ya drama melayu sangat aduh
and like what we say kan kita nak standby duit lebih sikit is because balik
kan kita nak grab kan jadi balik confirm penat pe kita dah ada activity kan lepas tu balik penat confirm nak grab kan
so that's why that's why I cakap yang ini I rasa lagi kita boleh save
kita dah kita bawa daripada rumah benda yang boleh pack
semua pack what I think is
better rather than kita bawa satu-satu gitu
then bawa banyak pinggan
it's better that kita bungkus bungkus satu-satu pack
so bila tu kita tinggal pass jer kat semua orang
so dalam everything kita boleh letak but like macam dia punya side
macam hotdog ke macam crabstick ke apa kan
ayam ke apa itu kita boleh letak dalam tupperware lah so
anybody can ni ah cuma mi mi ke nasi
ah tu kita boleh pack dekat bungkus so at least they can
tak lah sometimes people still need nasi what you never know you the kind yang nak nasi
ha you die die nak nasi ah betul tak
tak apa it's okay ya
mi untuk semua then letak nasi dekat dua bungkus sudah
nasi letak dua bungkus tu ah letak penuh-penuh
jadi kita tak payah ni ataupun letak satu tupperware
besar untuk nasi jer because the lauk-pauk is already we put different pe
I masak nasi goreng ah
macam esok kita nak pergi activity tu
ye kita beli everything
so kita potong semua
after kita potong semua simpan dalam ice box kita simpan dalam ice box the next day baru kita goreng and everything so bila kita nak pergi
so kita potong sayur sekali kita potong hotdog kita potong crabstick kita potong
ayam ke apa apa lah
yang kita nak kena potong kan apa yang
apa-apa lah fishball ke apa ah semua lah potong sekali
if rajin ah if rajin really rajin
kita boleh cucuk cucuk ah
cucuk hotdog fishball crabstick macam gitu sedap sikit
ha gitu
kita boleh minta tolong abang ke kak nani obvious ah dia tak akan tolong dia mesti kata nak tidur
oh but abang also nanti dia tired the next day abang kerja
but like what abang see if we really want to have some activity in the morning
ya that's why I cakap letak maybe mi ke
nasi kita letak dekat benda tu that's why I cakap terus nanti boleh buang tak payah ni
kita letak dekat tupperware jadi kalau kita letak dekat tupperware
tak payah ni so kita boleh buang
oh ya ya ya lepas tu kita cover pakai aluminium foil jer aluminium foil is it a'ah
tapi kita nak naik grab tu nak kena pegang juga lah
letak kat belakang ah semua
the whole kau punya ni
ah rides kau pegang jer barang-barang tu
confirm kalau semua goreng confirm kau akan rasa bosan kan
uh something like maybe lemak cili padi ke apa
letak so kita ada kuah dengan ni
tak payah eh
roti sandwich yes
apa yang kita perlu ada since ada event kan sandwich of course kena ada
so um that's why I cakap at least I nak letak satu dish
so bila ada satu dish tu
at least ada lah lauk macam
lauk kau cuma goreng-goreng jer kau akan rasa macam bosan sebab semua goreng
so at least kalau ada lauk sikit because
kau makan apa-apa pun kau mesti nak ada kuah kan
that's why I cakap
so at least I nak buat yang lemak cili padi ke apa ah something like that lah
ya like what I say maybe I nak buat yang tu
lemak cili padi ataupun I nak buat
uh sambal goreng satu sambal goreng satu lemak cili padi
sambal goreng is for mama because mama vegetarian
kita kena fikir nanti mama cakap eh sana ayam
eh sini ayam
ya we also need to remember eh kita kena beli uh vegetable ball
dengan apa tofu mushroom ah
some kind of this kind lah uh yang kita kena beli lah pasal kita bring along mama kan
confirm dia orang akan beli yang dekat belakang ah
dekat belakang rumah dekat pe
from there dia orang akan naik grab pe like what
uh abang seth cakap kan
macam abang kau ah dia pringles pringles tu tetap dia nak
you want to buy mi eh buy pula you want to masak mi hoon ke mi goreng
I think mi hoon goreng is better right because we got a lot right
so you want to cook nasi goreng is it
so you want me to cook the nasi goreng cina
I masak nasi goreng ikan bilis lah ada ikan bilis sedap sikit
ya lah ikan bilis itu lah that is what I mean
nasi goreng ikan bilis pakai ini pe is warna putih what
okay so you help me nanti potong-potong ayam
we potong
ya you potong ayam
so pasal I nak masak lauk pe
abang suruh potong hotdog ah nanti
dua packet cukup tak dua packet tak cukup empat packet
empat packet lah eh empat packet
but one thing I don't like is because I punya cut eh of hotdog eh is different
memang aku punya is like memang
slide slide uh ni apa
slice dia macam diagonal is it
aku tak nak lah macam
kalau yang ni kecil besar kecil besar because
aku punya orang is very particular about dia punya size kalau boleh aku nak buat tapi
sandwich lagi aku tak suka nanti senget macam bersepah
aku especially sandwich ni aku tak suka very particular lah
oh takpe
kita buat macam ni jer apa kata kita buat
so sebelah sapu tuna lah
lagi sebelah kita letak egg lah egg mayo lah
ah jadi bila tu kan dia jadi sedap tau ah I think this already good lah
so jadi dia orang tak ni
jadi dia orang kalau at least dia orang spread
ah tak ada lah ni sangat kan
tak lah pasal apa kalau sayur
ya because they don't really know macam mana nak letak ah
kau pun tahu pe aku kalau buat sandwich aku very particular aku nak make sure sandwich dia nampak cantik
so beli yang ada cili punya
you know itu baru sedap
so the crust apa awak nak buat ke
I think maybe kalau macam gini
since ada sandwich and ada ni then kita nak beli
fishball nak letak ke
since uh mama tak makan
so at least kita boleh buat cheese fries
if not nanti sampai sana semua dah taste not nice ya
kita nak beli mat yang dua dollar tu
tu lah aku pun fikir-fikir juga
because when we plan like what abang say when we plan every time
mesti tak jadi seh everything tak jadi tak jadi huh
I think why not we just buy a dress for kak nadiah
then for abang uh kita beli kasut jer
at least baju kan
she really need baju
since dia tak habis-habis cakap kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kan ah
denim means kita lump sum pe sebab
kita sharing what duit share right so beli satu it's considered cheap what
kita beli kat uniqlo
but since kita nak pergi tu kita kena
bawa baju extra lah
so balik time baju colour ni eh
pergi baju colour ni ah betul tak
maybe first day navy blue ke because everybody can have blue colour since kak nadiah kau pun suka blue colour
aini kau suka blue colour
abang kau pun ada blue colour aku rasa ah so
kita boleh go with the blue colour lah navy blue then the second day
mm balik time maybe
oh dah macam time aku nikah green and blue
I got my jubah
pink also can I got no issue about pink colour I think abang also got no issue
but nanti dia kena pakai smart smart nanti dia cakap
apa ni nak pergi picnic kena pakai smart smart because the pink colour is dia punya smart casual
one ya kena gosok
but that one become smart casual ah ya abeh nanti macam tak gosok gitu eh
tak boleh lah
forbidden a'ah forbidden jadi obedient
kelakar seh
is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
ya so I work from home for macam
then I feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why I rather work kat
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
that's why I tadi I ask you to take a picture of your your working setting
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah I will just like duduk depan depan then my laptop
oh make the home macam office like that ah
oh then what your wifi around your houses eh around your houses around the house macam good ah
ya lah then how you do your work seh macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai pakai pakai apa Microsoft or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out meh macam never lag or what
ya so now buat apa
oh you've been working part time kerja apa eh cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
but you are still working what okay lah tu means you dah survive sikit
kerja apa why you never explain
oh pack apa
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga kan
kerja kat mana kat warehouse eh
uh at ibu cik house lah the difference right
one week and then you cannot tahan
it's just too fast paced ah macam mm
ya one day berapa
if you are at the first first person ah then paling senang
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy ah
macam from
pack for eh no we start at about oh macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
uh scoop the kuah then after that you kiap the container then you
ah pack kat kitchen ah so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas lah then when you kiap the container then you also will kiap your finger lah
bla bla lah then lepas balik
I mean the the packing place yang I kerja is um
express gila lah especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat seh
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa seh kerja malam
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
ya so kerja apa
then kenapa you leave
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy one
okay then kerja ini kat mana
oh dekat lah
pukul sembilan eight thirty
you've been closer right every time sekarang I always saw you and
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when I see your InstaStory macam eh
apasal seh
oh gitu eh macam mata merah ah kirakan
like jealous ke like oh I have a boyfriend but you don't like err
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy faham lah that's the thing
meet tapi masih berbual kan
like on Whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
bagus ah
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
together and individually so macam okay ah let's say ah so ah cause sekarang dia dah right
oh that recent stories dia tak appear lah that kind of thing okay okay
cause ah dia sekarang work as financial adviser
uh you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat ah itu jer
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
mm so that is his career so his career now kan dia ah dia
uh gender and everything else so macam
kita is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
ya ya so ah so macam macam mana eh
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his pun pernah happen I don't know eh
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
so uh basically dia dia bilang me Hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu I thought
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling err bad
his dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
wow macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay lah sakit hati tu sakit hati lah tapi at least
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
ya but that someone that lady dia macam
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my no ah like
memang dia they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
like made a move lah macam message lah message the perempuan nak nak know better
kelakar kan
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good lah macam macam he he he he tell me things like err I want to explore he don't want to feel
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
betul lah ya lah professional that part it is lah but at the same time dia nak
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing tu juga I said macam I I say to him ah I also can say the same thing to you what but I choose to focus what is in front of me
from the start of the relationship I got even I pernah bilang you what bila kita nak
boleh lah I mean you nak comment pun comment lah because honestly
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so macam
macam okay
macam dependent lah
bukan macam okay so
ya ah so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
it's stupid lah tapi macam
ya lah faham lah
dia belum kan
ya lah faham lah but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
get it macam
for me now with Han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
I don't know lah I really don't know I don't know whether kita are compatible or what already lah because dia memang dah ada other mindset juga
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no lah because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of Hans
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu but the uh
it has been weeks already ah so if I cry now also macam
it's just tears eh macam really legit sia so macam ya lah
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand lah
tak apa uh it's okay not to make assumption ah but
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree ah dia cakap
uh hmm no he I don't know dia cakap um why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just um be friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu mm
I mm only just now I met him lah after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then I asked ada siapa kalau ada Hans I say to them I tak nak join
mm tapi ya ini susah ah susah
she she sense it lah so macam mm
the group of friends yang I bilang pun macam
so this issue macam I really tak nak bilang orang but
ya tak lah I think pasal I'm just too macam
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
ya ah so ya dah itu jer lah
kadang kadang seh dalam kerja so macam if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out ah
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me kan ah what time you sleep and stuff right
twelve tahu
sometimes I habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu I'll just hang out talk I just like err but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so macam
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I baru balik that kind of thing then once I go home
then it affected my work in terms of productivity lah I lupa benda I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
ah your rumah macam tukar hari hari seh
then before raya I think I went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
it's only your room tak involved lah
but the thing is I don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya mm me me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
because this wifi sucks you okay for example ah kalau sekarang you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
I always do outside kalau tak I'll just do at other places
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
mm patutlah boleh lah gitu ya then I need to pasang one more loh
tak ada lah but
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy kan no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
like on the same track check in apa task you buat ah
macam gitu lah penat seh so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
macam gitu lah ya ya ya correct correct ya
err at pukul sepuluh no worry lah can can
err macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless ah I don't know lah apa lah
merepek gila ah because I mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
oh so you your pay macam mana bila internship
wow ya it's just it's just poly things poly memang
is it tak tahu lah sekali five hundred juga eh
ah then go ahead bro ambil jer
ya then after that you can decide bila you nak continue degree or
you're you're the type yang boleh belajar what I'm not so
no need lah ah now I'm like thinking nak ambil ke tak ah tapi tak apa lah no need ah
ya I'm thinking of that lah but tengok ah
then after a while kan dia err
it got to a point that dia macam super nonsense
no but I um the the the first wife I don't know ah like apa motive dia buat macam gitu semua kan
dia nak apa revenge
so dia don't love the husband anymore
so dia just nak revenge only
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether dia fall in love with the colleague or
habis um so the guy love her or don't love her the guy like her or don't like her
then why the guy still jumpa with the shermaine and all
dia kan jumpa with the
the han so hee punya bapa
they meet and then after that err macam they the the guy the new guy share information with
ni wife punya bapa
the show is good you know the first few episodes was so good you know that I really want to watch I really want to keep watching and watching kan tapi after awhile
no it's not about the episodes it's about the way they run the show like the was so good ya the story line was so good tapi after awhile it's just so merepek
we watched that so many times and I still cry tu so sekarang I'm watching cerita reply nineteen ninety eight have you watched that
um ah there's dia ada reply nineteen ninety four reply nineteen ninety seven and reply nineteen ninety eh nineteen eighty eight

ah ya takpe ah
macam standard ah cakap english ah okay okay not bad
tukar question eh sempat sia tukar okay takpe
my dreams okay tak yah let it go into specifics ah but like my dreams would require to sacrifice most of my leisure time yes that's a brief description
aha that one is uh takpe lah
aku would want to be invisible
eh bocui sia nah tak payah tak payah we don't snitch
but what about kau
eh by the way kau watch uh umbrella academy
aku rasa they talking about like
kau tahu like
but it's like a natural thing ah for kau kan and some it's honestly called talent ah to be that smart at that young age
yes correct ah betul
so in a way pun kau like grateful lah for what has happened because it made you too because
a'ah overrated pun
aku still wouldn't hear it lah to be honest cause
but also don't need say ah cause kitanya radio our campus radio pun overplayed their songs ah
if kau realise
eh I wanted to join eh come on lah aku nak join sia
aku feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially kat Singapore kan kitanya country small
oh mak yes
low-key kalau ada ah eh
but kau imagine though
confirm yes correct betul betul aku agree
work is a an activity apa
ah we can call it a food lah that I know you won't be jelak of is sweets lah
because normal lah everytime aku nampak kau selalu makan gula selalu makan gula ada benda ah kat dalam mulut kau selalu
K kau rindu sekolah sangat ke huh
standard confirm oh yang that sebelah drink store that western the burger
betul lah betul lah cause before you eat with your mouth you eat with your eyes ah they say
but here's another thing though aku nak kena tanya kau
takde no such thing
dia kau dah check up
awal pe
ya I know aku dari tadi nampak ah so that's why but it's okay understandable
so kau boleh cakap dengan diri kau macam
takde I cannot
just a little bit just a little bit eh perang ah just a little bit jer
head ah kirakan head of department
but I mean actually not that bad especially yang that time ah
aku dengan cyprus kena caught kena kat toilet
err suruh jumpa miss tan mister adrian and that time mister adrian was a ah
then dia cakap dengan aku pasal all these actions
then dia cakap dengan aku oh your punishment is going to be you have to go to
no thank god he he just he just then I'm like eh serious ah aku stress sia twenty twenty class what the fuck
mmhmm eh macam tahu jer not bad macam tahu jer
ah a'ah sia lagi lagi NITEC let's be honest ah NITEC has more girls that higher NITEC that's a fact
ah sorry ada orang ada girlfriend takpe takpe takpe
I mean in a way kau boleh train kan that shit too
oh like macam straight away not bad
not only macam pasal discount price and shit cause
ah apa lagi soalan kau tengah tengok ni
dia ada berapa soalan sia
yeah that few is berapa lah
aku definitely heard of the word
apa ah
macam detective ah aku ingat aku ingat
but honestly ah aku like just like that ah the aircon on the bus
sekarang most to most yang buat joke is
aku lah
ah susah sia
okay ah but I understand uh pun kau have your own things going and you know I wish you well and shit lah
no the best time was when we were year one kat J seven
uh kau setakat kat belakang I don't know why you looking at fish hooks and okay lah that guy interested
ah ah aku masih ingat
but if I had known earlier that kau akan like you know quit soon
I mean aku understand lah aku understand
oh merepek
ah yes oh my god kau
that's why aku agree ah with kau on that
you are better off now kau tengah buat what kau love honestly we still keep in contact so that's also good lah
kau wait ah kau tunggu aku I think I got told you this before bila aku ada motor aku datang situ kalau tak kita lek lek jap
uh tak aku kalau lagi four more
tapi takpe kau tunggu jer
ah boleh boleh enjoy that's that's my main goal lah to be honest lah eh
ah fifteen minutes twenty fifteen minutes boleh ah fifteen minutes
if aku
aku not sure sia
do kau have something in mind I'm really not sure sia
especially kau dengar Converse seven to ten august that time
tak tahu tadi terhang sikit ah eh
I'd say looks ah cause honestly body you can do anytime but if your looks rabak kan and your face ah that's it got nothing to do already just give up unless
body can do anytime makan makan makan
how about kau
wah bagus bagus abeh honest eh
it's just aku rasa mainly cause of apa body type is it that kind of thing
ah yes I mean at that point of time pun kan so like kau just need more experience a little bit more experience that's all
kau tengah cakap pasal which food court ada
yes is it that one yang kau tengah cakap that food court
dorang taruk those uh what do they call that
like feed properly the chicken that kind of thing kan bukan macam give them some
air and
kau punya melayu hancur sia apa yang oksigen apa sia
I aku tak pernah sia cakap like oksigen like
ever in malay maybe that's why aku tak tahu ah this is my honestly my first time hearing it
exactly and the fact that macam mana eh all those dormitory workers
but it's just sad that they have to live inside there until aku tak tahu bila
actually that's what they should do sia after like phase two pasal kita semua quarantine kat rumah kan and shit
then you slowly move to phase two which is yang kau cakap implement tu and then slowly gradually macam sekarang ah
tapi sekarang tak lepas phase two jer semua orang keluar
but you know the problem now is also pasal
older generations them and their phone tak payah cakap ah
aku pernah experience like customers old auntie lah
kau pun heard ah the reason they
pun is just cause the economy is dropping that's all
oh ya ya aku nampak
at least also like go out with a purpose are ada orang just keluar setakat untuk lepak
ah yes okay ya betul betul betul
kau nampak national day
as in like tak yah cakap ah
like a lot of people then aku nampak like a tweet on Twitter that says like
because nobody is following the safety measure rules whatsoever one metre apart takde jer semua lama just one big ass
ah takpe lah president
eh but area kau ada fireworks
but like you know romantics sikit who knows bring you to bali
I would like settle down if one country if one country aku boleh settle down kan aku would settle down at
have you seen the mountains there just online aku macam
but if kau nak peace you know do your work alone enjoy retirement shit
that place untuk aku is perfect ah
K the other side aku dengar it's like something about
aku nak quit sia aduh
but ni macam last minute ah aku didn't know that err our school provided a bursary
cause aku didn't know until miss tan text aku like
ya I think so but then aku fikir balik eh bukan aku dah nak graduate april oh sekarang jer baru dia nak bagi
oh nenek eh kau tinggal sorang kan dalam
asal room kau gelap sia kau tak
oh takde apa
subuh so technically kau should
aku nya time eh
dah habis out of stock so sad
wallet yang tu lah yang the sometimes by designer tu I wanted the the the apa tu oh gosh oh dusty pink I swear I tell abang syafiq to buy fast
tengok oh but this one bulky
the one that I want is very apa tu very tipis dia boleh macam is literally wallet tau and then when you put the phone behind dia tak nampak bulky but cannot use with err cover I think
not phone casing bag lah it's a it's a wallet bag dia ada put phone belakang and it has chain chain strap
tapi tu bulky seh
I can't find any know macam like boring dia punya stroller semua macam like not the one that I want and they mostly is pre-order so that day I want to buy on the spot
abeh takleh ah abeh apa
ya so you open is really very nice actually I like the stroller then me and my friend kan keep on cari-cari like which one we want then finally we found this one is very nice but it's super expensive lah but it's okay lah one time beli
dia tak lightweight it's very berat it's like eleven
abeh lepas tu err I like thinking lah whether to get or not because at first
cause at first macam there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that one like besar gila and then but that one can put two people in two babies two babies
your head lah how can you sit ya you see you see tengok tengok show me ya that one that one the the tu a'ah cantik kan that's why you you see the video it's
cantik kan ah actually dia ada another one it's called Nuna Mixx ini Nuna Mixx next yang Nuna Mixx tu dia fold sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh shorten so dia macam dia compact err so yang ni yang baru ni dia compact and very
apa tu dia fold just nice ah and it can stand on its own and then dia boleh recline sampai ah lay very flat untuk baby baring ya and then dia punya
dia punya canopy boleh tarik sampai kat bawah the canopy the tu the cover ye lah bila dia tidur then like sunlight right either that or you ah you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
like no you use up to six months after that lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi
it's meant for something like that lah macam is heavy or probably the height or weight is not ah suitable untuk dorang anymore
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that macam kalau I want to take grab ke apa ke
because only grab can use uh if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat kalau you take taxi tak payah car seat
cik usop kan kawan abah cik usop ah what oh my god my toe sakit gila skit gila
tapi why seh why is it even swollen eh
no lah I scared lah cause that time I also sakit kaki again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the dia nya tu
how it works ya you will see how how dia punya tu works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the belakang the belakang is meshed is like macam like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part lepas tu when she baring kan belakang dia dia boleh rasa ah panas eh apa the air and then this one also boleh buat like bassinet bassinet
because bawah dia punya feet area kan you can just snap out dia punya feet area tu then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that lah
abeh lepas tu I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar sebab dia colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because dia boleh pusing and baby can face me instead
ya and then like let's say lah macam err apa I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down dia tepi dia ada net ada meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the barang to sampai next week I think about seven days
what baju mm mm
oh this is the baju you say you wanted to pakai eh wanted to buy and then scared dia tak sampai on time
hais so many things oh I want to give away a lot of bags away those tu semua kat dalam box tu I don't know nak tengok ah bag aku yang nak giveaway how to do work like this haiyo
a'ah seh dia dah half lah
and then washing machine pun belum habis the washing machine haven't finish ah so many things to do need dia ada dryer kat dalam dia but ya dryer dia is not is not ah drying lah tapi nak kena like ya it's damp so you you still have to like you still have to sangkut sidai outside
outside ah but it's now raining so I think I'm just gonna put it here then maybe kalau balik rumah jurong I will just bring bring along kalau macam I stay lama ah
ah ya tapi eh tapi ni tak boleh masuk banyak kalau dia nak kalau dia nak basuh like like everyday dia basuh like dua tiga kalau jeans jeans susah ah
tapi laundry mat it's okay lah just get laundry mat lah better what can wash all satu kali ni wash dua tiga kali nak kena wash seh as in cause banyak kan so kalau baju baby okay ah baju baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything masuk dalam tapi bila drying dia kan it's sikit sebab dia punya drying is dalam basket kecil tu you have to keep inside that basket kecil then kalau letak banyak-banyak it won't kering
I mean it's good cause kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan ya socks underwears all the small small ah ni lah T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see ah if he even if he wash this one right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to cuci to dry satu kali and is more saving lah dari dia pergi pergi bawah then washing machine and then after that you know oh no cuci is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash kat sini kat dalam washing machine ni
uniform tak boleh masuk ni busy uniform masuk dalam ni ada ah just have to search ada ada but masalahnya dia nak angkat benda tu ah pergi toilet everytime
orh okay lah ya he can there's there's a slightly bigger one like like maybe double the size of that ya tengok ah dekat lazada ke shopee ke ah no lah ezbuy don't want ezbuy lambat sampai tak habis-habis seh
I mean shopee sells everything oh you know semalam kelakar abang boy called me
he said that his shopee nya barang delivered tapi tak sampai cause he find cannot find the barang so so I said to him lah you contact the seller lah and say mm that the barang tak sampai then after that ah then I fikir balik confirm he he don't know how to do all these lah kan maksudnya never mind lah you give me what's the items yang missing and then your home address ah
lepas tu he he already give me everything then after that he call me again he say takpe zurah dah dah jumpa mak buang kat dalam storeroom because because mak thought it's sampah because it comes in a plastic yang macam ya so mak thought it's sampah nasib baik mak belum buang he just dump she just dump it inside the storeroom abeh the funny thing is arrisa tak
cakap dengan mak is is barang ni tau don't know ah maybe ah cause mak ambil buat masuk agaknya then arrisa also
it's either that or it's either that or the dia macam ah saw it saw it somewhere lah
it's funny then after that I arrisa also laugh I heard over the phone lah kelakar gila mmhmm then mak ingat sampah
nasib baik tak terbuang baju baby seh I think she bought baju baby
I told her go shopee buy all the stuff don't buy me then actually on that day yang datang sana I wanted to show her macam mana nak pakai so busy and all that nasib baik ibu dah tunjuk dia
then abang boy macam like ah pening kepala cause she will start buying stuff I say it's okay lah it's still cheap seh rather than you want to go kiddy palace so expensive
I don't know mana tahu
then you think my back not sakit meh sit like this no because my kaki is sakit that's why macam duduk gini I think I'm gonna feel the same thing like that time apa the my left my left thigh sakit so I need to
because dia macam tangkap belakang I don't know ah but it's so sakit like and now it's not so bad yang that time nya really very bad it's so painful
ya let's hope I put cream esok malam ni nak nak urut lagi
tu ah
now she take lesser naps tau macam she can stay awake for longer time cause she's like almost two months already I can chill I can chill
mm the other night I didn't I didn't I I lambat change her ni kan change her diaper wah she melalak like kena pukul seh she rimas
aura after this we mandi okay after this can go mandi lah can go mandi lah correct
but it's funny because I I do your right side more than your left side you know cause I cause tadi I put like that right then you see so fast ya then this side yang tak then this side I've been doing like I'm very careful
she wants to stay awake dah nak tertidur dah
eh sakit seh I think really ah my leg no no no my toe my toe my toe not my leg
cause the other side also hari tu sakit tapi orh this one more painful
that time sakit dua-dua tapi this one the left side is more painful
then I was like ni siapa seh at first I saw the name lah but the name kan bukan aiman dia letak dia letak is it aiman instagram
oh he put aim E S R eh aim nama
ya lah aim nama dia apa aiman amsar eh ah
mana dia dapat that idea you should ask a'ah as in aiman aiman jer lah then suddenly the mother put aisar oh adik dia adik dia apa
a'ah ya ah semalam I heard you talk to shakirah pasal nama why ah like suddenly you you say macam dulu her name is aura nur sofia about her
mata dia gini jap lagi nak mandi dah tidur lah pula
aiyo nanti she cannot fit some of her pampers dah tak boleh fit dah masuk S oh ya I don't know whether you know kasi baby punya susu macam mana like how the increase right but I read at the tin kan eight weeks to twelve weeks sekarang kena kasi hundred fifty seh
then I like hundred fifty hundred fifty is this full you know satu is it okay
then I like see because macam macam dia still small seh abeh lepas tu kasi hundred fifty I feel like macam
tummy dia not that big what that time kasi ninety dah muntah-muntah aku kalau kasi semalam macam buat hundred twenty she never even finish she drink like fifty jer
that's why I say hundred fifty is the current it's the now right now nak kena buat hundred fifty then hundred twenty pun dia tak tak minum habis macam mana
first month pun kita kasi ninety jer tak kasi hundred twenty ya that one I know dia boleh reach that kind until that amount
ya because I'm worried that it's too much for her but then when I read the ikut the tin punya instructions eh because ah this week eh next week wait ah two more days she'll be eight weeks already so eight to twelve weeks is hundred fifty then I like shock seh macam huh why skip hundred twenty then suddenly hundred fifty apa seh
hundred twenty ah so now cause last time when she drink dia tak tak minum banyak kan macam dia tak habis ninety right I will start doing sixty so now if dia tak habis hundred twenty I will do ninety cause she has to increase apa she cannot stay sixty ninety she needs to go up to ninety hundred twenty okay we gonna drink like that untuk you okay
I'm going to make like that if not you tak habis susu wasted wasted wasted
masih ah daripada semalam does it really look swollen ya slightly ya slightly yes

so my school starts actually for now it's like um tengah holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october nineteen tu pun now is just only like semester one jer belum semester two then like it's still like year one so
macam I feel like year one ni lama gila
ya my friends also like nak ajak hang out also my friend you know sarah
she ada club so she sarah and nasrul ni uh both of them is club is school of applied science punya
ah is more like your own course habis is more of like leadership punya kind of
then um tak salah
sarah have like err apa ni event ah for their um for their so she's the one that like macam like overall in charge
so ada ada um ada ada groups yang kena buat event tu one is her group kena pilih another one is another group tapi nashrul punya group like um tak kena chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week baru like we
I also have my own tapi tak apa lagi pasal malas
ya pasal malas
honestly I respect those people yang macam dia orang sudah like for two years
and then doing the same thing that budak poly buat then having to go through the same thing like for another three years kat poly it's just so tiring and exhausting ah that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people yang
selepas they choose to just work
apa ni uh studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
poly kan macam also is like poly so like I feel like macam ni poly example I take it as eh having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
it's not like macam easy you know like for those people who really like um
buat the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
salute those people who macam have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to um poly ya
phase is just um submitting your diploma ranking course lah kalau your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah kan dia dapat interview so dia pass interview and then she already get her what ah her results that like she can go in like like her place for
um pharmaceutical science memang sudah chop chop for her so macam okay lah she sudah selamat she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because dia memang can already it's like
so macam kalau interview sudah pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all lah
but for me because my interview tak dapat
now focus solely on which is uh kita orang pasal kita orang tak ada exam also so they look
over um they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day macam for us kan ada orang like
um sekolah dia orang satu hari is like is combination of subjects but for me is like kalau math is
then after that kalau there's a mixture of A and B is banyak and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like um three to four
gitu then kalau macam C banyak gitu then maybe around two point five to three point five gitu then um
like baru berapa compared to my other two friend I think they did more better lah in a sense
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech memang nak try dapat biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan dia like
dia like mati-mati nak biomedical science jer like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
but the thing he tak put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense lah cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
biology also tak pernah dapat A
A susah nak dapat then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard lah cause it's the um they focus um on biology the most
so like this semester tak ada exam so I next semester ada exam
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay pasal assignment dia pun is
tak banyak like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day kan like through read virtually like other then after that um
habis ada quiz juga that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
then the practice question is like biasa macam homework gitu
mostly banyak presentation but it's good lah
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm um when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages pasal like I think you will feel like
kalau I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu kan is just like my weakness like
then pasal presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then macam
senang lah but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates yang
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation punya tu
sometimes I'm like wow kita dah eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near um uniforms so macam eh how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old lah then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage kan aku macam actually it's normal macam biasa like wow it's just normal lah honestly
and it's okay cause macam tak ada boyfriend kan it's okay lah macam we don't really take that into my mind macam oh like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like keluar dates with you know I think
I don't really mind lah kalau I have a boyfriend or not as long as macam that is like um kawan dekat you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me pasal later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
NAFA is like lah kirakan
like different people also like different lah honestly like um the things that they're prioritising and it's all like semua ada masing-masing lah hanya
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to macam have a lot of worries like oh pasal duit and all that of course you want your family to be macam stable lah like in every um ya in everything you know
it's very hard lah like I feel like kalau family tak cannot like tak tak ada like stability and all that kan I feel like ah one day confirm will fall apart punya
and some more I also like the type of person yang tak message orang
like wow kalau dah malas dia punya malas is malas tak aku boleh like
for one week straight tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa cause like I'm that type of person ah
so macam ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up kan macam wah like heartbreak this heartbreak gila babi you know like that kind
but then like wah like sekarang I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
but even though like there are times macam eh macam nak ada orang like to be by your side like a boyfriend lah okay kirakan like cakap good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
kita boleh get over it lah there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
so like sometimes kalau oh ada family gathering kan it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something ah even my sister like
like uh video call her friends during ah apa ni I'm having a dinner so I I feel like macam like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay lah kalau ada kawan tu okay but then like kalau it's time to like for your family you focus on your family jer tak mahu get mixed lah like video call with friends like
other time you can do what like kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang like jumpa kawan habis kat rumah also like kawan then like when are you going to like you know um
mm spend time with your family not really ya tak ada
wow I'm lucky to be in such a family kind punya vibes cause different family different ah ada family like focus um
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future kalau nak ada family I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then kalau like my anak-anak macam ada boyfriend ke girlfriend ke aku macam nak bagi advice sikit
I got here lah so I mean initially we plan to meet pukul dua belas gitu but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay lah I want to naik basikal then now I'm regretting it lah
hot pun it's not tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah like the past few days it's not really that got lah but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place tak tak jauh sangat it's eleven kilometers
and the weather cuaca pun okay juga lah so I mean it's okay you got lah so I mean it's
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law tapi dia cakap difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling tak payah pakai mask pe
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask yang kena and the one the government kasih atau the one that they government suruh lah
I just use the kain like the one the the they call it the kain untuk muka
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent ah barang-barang kena muka like some debris you just go to uh face what's that at least apa dia ada protection because if not like
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is tempat kosong so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre lah maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to cepat juga lah but then
then some more ada construction tempat construction so
so the tempat construction is just debris ah then the habuk-habuk masuk hidung then I was like my nose a bit itchy lah then I mean
okay ah then ya so that that was the time yang cause that one tempat dekat dengan forest forest sana because it's the ulu ulu tempat ulu sana so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya lah err lalat masuk lah hidung
eh lalat masuk mulut
I mean literally it's not at house anymore lah dia dah dekat luar lah
eh ya dia masuk lah I mean
you are cycling penat-penat jauh it's like you are jauh then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna pakai mulut eh pakai your hidung ya it's kena use your pakai mulut lah you
then by chance the thing masuk and nasib tak masuk my the the air pipes it masuk my esophagus straightaway so I just telan
dia makan betul ah I also tak berak-berak so okay ah
sakit no ah it just
I think it's just extra protein ah I don't know apa dia makan kat that ulu area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots what then then they evolve
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein lah abeh some people confirm makan maggot what good
you want nak makan bat
currently I'm taking kat the the ubi sana lah I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing ah like naik basikal if you exercise you go distance and if you work pakai kerja deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also lah like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license lah bike license boleh tolong apa like like two in one so just settle everything
aku pun tak tahu but I I think depends lah I think now the the rate dia dah really drop dah jatuh so
cause I think now there's a influx dah banyak I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now kerja ah apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a ada grabfood dengan foodpanda eh apa deliveroo account ah I don't really need dapat masuk joined foodpanda lah so I think
I those two is enough ah and then now also masih because I'm now masih like recently kena diagnosed dengan hyperthyroidism so my saya I just sakit sangat lah I just susah nak nak exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down ah just do less
I don't remember calling it docket uh I think the maybe dia orang it's a foodpanda punya benda ah pasal for apa grabfood dengan deliveroo they call it ah incentive so dapat incentive like you deliver ten ah
thirty forty dollars that was itu pun only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one kerja lah the orang lain semua kerja kerja so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing orang-orang lain semua ah so
that is grabfood lah for for deliveroo incentive punya ada every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
like you in a in a pickle you just call jer nanti they just will assist you ah tolong just tolong you like just like that grabfood you call sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat
oh ya ya depends lah kalau dia orang nak kasih tip dia orang nak kasih tip ah I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself tak ada tip culture what it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip nanti dia orang fikir eh ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
ya they give ten dollar I tip just kasih ah
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app atau the cash so they will just give you cash ah like from singapore's tipping
food their tipping like their the the person the company they ambil duit the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
rabak ah but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip ah so that's what the company the company
well I mean because tak ada duit selalu no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment pakai dia punya that account lah so ya so my biggest is paling banyak is ten dollar ah lah but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar lah itu dapat terus sepuluh dollar just just the just deliver and it was a tempat pun like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically tempat dia is like depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan then he just like maybe
fifty meter and lima puluh meter jer I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar dia orang kasih then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter pergi angkat itu jer
been a long time ago lah like dah lama juga ah I've gained back the empat ratus tu so
like four empat about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories ah barang like
it's err I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun it's you what
the thing is sometime pun orang like you rider you will sometimes take naik basikal you I mean then you anything happen like then eh guai lan padahal sometimes you forget eh your your means your safety first lah you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you lupa about yourself lah so it's quite stupid ah sometimes like you
we are paid by duit apa by by by time so the time you cepat you get more money so kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu green green light belum green light tu showing but you want nak to go you want to go
ya lah so safety also have to come first ah because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk lah but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian jalan jalan lah so like senang
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and pergi the pedestrian pathway tapi
kadang-kadang pun singapore drivers
memang semacam ah
err talking about check back blind spot tadi on the way here already I was I was really know I was
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on um from the main road going straight so dia dari the the the other side nak masuk the main road from the zebra crossing ah the junction so the
the driver dia tak nampak ah I like I was really prepared to break from jauh but I was already dah macam dah nak
I was really like to be beside her in that main road dia just jam break ah then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like dia not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her ah
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour boleh nampak apa dari jauh then like there was a car like
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't tak ternampak tak nampak so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break ah
so she just she jam break herself ah then just I hear dia cakap sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her lah
oh ya err so sekarang I'm taking my bike license lah like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
I mean it's a good thing for a license lah you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are dari the cyclists ah you are like basically the food chain ah kat bawah sekali
ah tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh
ya like I think then I think the instructor pun cakap you because some people dah dia dah ada three A license of the three class three three license
then they dia orang nak ambil class two B then they then I think they instructor pun cakap ah you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but sekarang nak nak naik motor then now you know orang motor apa yang jadi so just now I was doing practical lah I did revision but then I think what reason siang sangat because
like cepat sangat ah because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
uh prac five is the revision dah I mean it's the internal cost lah but I already cleared that just that I did revision because dah lama tak naik motor
six kat luar
oh you mean keluar from the to the main road ah yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also naik basikal so I can see apa yang or like what's happening ah kata orang too happening sia I also macam takut ah nak nak nak nak keluar that main road just to naik basikal
I because I choose ubi pasal pun like dekat dengan basikal so I think I I mean naik basikal sana okay lah I don't want to naik basikal every time go pevery time go
I mean aku pun don't mind lah kena ride on some something ride on me but
depends lah so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay lah once in a while occasion so like how aku naik naik basikal sini to to here then also I need to go back naik basikal so depends lah but then nak every time nak take lessons no thanks ah
I will just take public but then now pasal nak dekat so I naik basikal to jer lah
dua puluh enam dua puluh enam the practical like depends lah kadang-kadang in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
I mean basikal pun okay for exercise like I mean comes to dapat motor pun okay lah you
like for transportation because now also tengah like belajar pun like easy lah like boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik public abeh public tempat penuh sangat then you cannot sit down terus macam
I don't know lah I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always macam
I I I don't know lah macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik
singapore I rasa lah I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is err I mean reliable just that I don't know why ah
I was I rasa kubur-kubur dan kena you dug up the kubur then underground then hantu dah semua datang
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike kat sana is one sixty
I don't know ah I want to jimat duit pun okay lah but then I want to nak like I mean nak nampak handsome sikit ah so
tak handsome sangat lah
ya like ah muka aku pun buruk sangat so kalau pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi at least kalau at least I from a seven maybe masuk naik atas ke nine ke eight ke all over there ah
you pandai juga eh motor kau
I think when I think kalau nak beli motor pun I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe uh as a second second owner ah not gonna buy until dah nak habis maybe maybe
kalau ada duit of course obviously I will buy ah like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out ah like
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing ah macam like that's because I would be macam jauh away from singapore ya like for enam bulan so I think see how first lah
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing lah ada ada datang balik terus the tyre hilang tinggal handlebar jer kat sana but park kat carpark tinggal handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing lah but
ah I so that's why I need to see first most probably tengok lah most probably I just comeback
then uh I think most probably I will still nak ambil class three three license lah I mean
I mean we err like uh nak buat family cannot be bringing your child kalau ada child naik naik naik motor pe I means still can lah but then like cannot lah like but singapore I mean were asking if want to naik naik bus pe public but then
like when it comes to reliability macam barang-barang selalu breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
aiya I think that one too vague lah like everything can be improve lah semua benda boleh boleh improve pe ada benda merepek pun boleh improve
so tengok lah like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much ah nanti benda problem nanti then you are relying that thing benda rosak then you are
so pandai-pandai ah so that one also cannot rely too much lah
oh ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn ah berbual for I mean this conversation we are having so
which um the surprise yang paling besar yang orang like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
oh so like ah okay okay so duduk lama-lama then suddenly you just don't know either dia orang datang so they put your car then what happen next
so we basically dah kereta you just waiting waiting then dia orang dah sampai tempat pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park lah so then after that dia orang nak bawa to the place to eat lah so and so tempat makan dia at where exactly
okay now let's understand so siapa like you who siapa who was there like siapa kat sana semua like is it your all your soccer mates ah is it just them or ada orang lain celebrating
okay lah I mean ya I mean the also quite gerek lah but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday ah orang like you are with lah people you love orang kalau kawan help your family depends like everyone like ada orang macam nak celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves tak nak orang involved
everybody orang celebrate differently ah so I think it's good lah like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want ah ada some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite dia padahal dia tak nak celebrate they are just nak lepak kat rumah
nak tidur tu jer so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want ah
just kasih duit jer I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff ah I think like ah you give me duit I I can spend myself you give me a voucher kat also I happy dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah
so I think that will be is enough untuk like for me lah tapi
I mean it's good lah you like your friends chip in everything for barang-barang for you
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting lah like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are eh apa like what is happening and like
tengah buat apa ni what they doing sia you are dalam dalam hati is just takut tapi it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say ah duit vouchers are a good thing ah like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just orang just acquaintances you just tanya the mutual friend like eh apa dia suka ah like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to apa
pergi shopping rather you maybe buy a like get err voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also tak shopping banyak sangat
and ya I think the typical barang for guy is orang kasih apa eh kasih those perfume I guess the the they demo apa lagi uh they don't call it perfume dia orang panggil apa eh oh cologne ah cologne but I mean
I don't know lah jangan nak nak step atas cakap perfume sudah lah for me lah okay but
err tapi ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch lah like senang ah unless orang dia macam those uh yang benda benda the all the watches dia dah dah dah ada rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course lah tak payah fikir pasal tu
even grand but then orang orang orang siapa seh ni aku tak berbual then terus it's like
it's like err it's like eh ah like awkward lah you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand lah so so orang kalau fikir okay invite orang lebih lebih padahal you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself tak payah tak payah no need to hide your personality gitu
okay that is I mean birthdays lah but then it's like I mean to me you fikir fikir birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like apa that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person lah dah dah dah tua dah lama or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
okay whatever you said that one orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat like you I mean like birthday birthday ah
tak payah nak mm susah sangat like what you said kalau orang nak book tempat pun as a as an example kalau the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december orang orang confirm like it's gonna be fully book lah so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya lah there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday nak barang-barang semua yang bagus ah like I mean for a celebration lah it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays ah once in a lifetime ah you can you are gonna be that age for once only uh unless err I don't know percaya reincarnation that one different topic lah
okay uh uh ya I guess that's susah ah tapi I think dah nak they by their by their age
jauh lah like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december ah then you have to book very early but then
banyak banyak hotel pun nak book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard lah pasal you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating ah
okay lah ya I mean ya lah I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya lah COVID sekarang buat everything susah even
not even just nak keluar holiday like nak keluar untuk kerja overseas is like the deployment kat overseas is orang semua susah susah is like now everybody kena in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this apa apa this career dia orang tengah buat is on hold pasal of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point lah not just birthdays ah so like all other like holidays or even like work ah kerja kerja critical this is a it's like a
a good err thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened lah so like orang can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect ah like in the future is this ah like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead jauh jauh lain ah
I mean the furthest I went paling jauh is U like the I went to that was bila kecil-kecil ah los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember apa yang I did
I mean it helps lah you you got you like you already plan lah nak pergi okay okay I want aku nak pergi jepun so I want to like at least belajar a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
taberu makan like like all those ah keyword like taberu makan and ah coco desuka like ni nak pergi err like go where nak pergi mana go where some something like that lah so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard lah nak cari makan makanan halal but then
I mean yang the big staple food there is you can just I mean minta so I guess ikan sushi nasi and one
I mean hokkaido no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only yokohama that eh no oh no tokyo is lagi tinggi dari yokohama so no that's the highest I've been is to tokyo so but
I think hokkaido tempat tempatnya ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff ah benda-benda cream is usually benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk I mean that that that latitude tinggi-tinggi pun memang understandable lah so ya I mean hokkaido is when it comes to makanan tempat benda sejuk lah dessert
I think it's not also just that lah I mean you also tempat
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also dia orang pun cantik juga I mean their complexion is there tempat pasal there tempat sejuk if it's cold then you don't really sweat much tempat so it depends ah
I mean that's understandable lah you see orang-orang yang mat salleh orang those memang the further north
but the percentage point tak tinggi sangat lah so it's ya lah I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends ah
honestly I think it's a waste of money orang like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just takut eh orang also pergi then I never pergi it's like I cannot talk about it sial berbual abeh then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that dia orang dah pergi so that can talk
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot untuk nak anuh dah just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite merepek ah orang nak belanja then up to them
the other day was just the other day was first time first time aku turun rumah dia then after that aku try kan ah baju dia I mean dia tak pernah nampak cause COVID pe
she was satisfied with it lah which I'm I'm relief lah cause I scared macam
for baju nikah right
apa tu what is what did they call that ah
takde glow that's what I meant takde glow
baju dia right is baju lama
berapa eh
that baju already on the rack since
material the bajunya material is bridal setting right
yang baju dalam baju dalam dia is a dress
kat mana seh
jauh sia
jauh siol

cause that ya I like that it's from australia aku punya pun she from australia sia
ya actually I thought seventy is standard shipping then the guy actually upgraded to express and he didn't charge me so I think I probably paid for the express shipping because the the website it didn't said macam okay standard shipping is this cost express shipping is this cost I didn't ya I didn't have an option
that's why I aku macam shock huh I get express shipping thank you lah
yes and is like cost you a bomb but I did my research what so I actually read up review whoever who bought the same brand uh of roller skates then I see macam okay most of them actually it said that is fit to your true size so you don't have to worry about sizing up or sizing down
adidas takde

macam okay look at their wardrobe okay let's just wear this out
macam okay
when the time is right then they probably like imagine kalau dia dah pregnant
then oh kau apa
kaunye favourite drama apa
boleh macam-macam ah I mean you can go korea korean drama
actually aku tak tahu like legit
eh tapi I mean like you always tengok ni apa
so what you macam you punya favourite drama
oh jadi kau most of the time tengok yang variety show ah
aku rasa is tujuh hari
okay apa cerita dia
bedek ah
aku sekolah then
ah yes kita semua more of like
itu actually rabak gila seh
betul betul I mean kita tengok
kita selalu tengok I think YouTube
yes ada dia punya timing serious gila
that's my macam go to err
it's the it's the only time that I baca surat khabar
a'ah betul kau habis cerita kau
aku kat tepi tengok aje dah habis belum
langgar tak timing dia
thailand drama not for me I mean aku tak tengok sangat thailand drama
yang macam comedy movie because they quite funny ah
aku tahu lah I mean
so obvious cam dia ada adam apple and
ada like they very tall for guys dia punya features macam very tall then very rough hands
that's macam
dia punya telltale sign ah
now now because of surgery also susah nak apa tu nak err nak bezakan lelaki ngan perempuan you can lacking of open you know you know
oh ya actually aku tengok juga kat Facebook that one oh my god like really look like ya really look like a woman
that that's the dangerous part kau imagine eh kau imagine macam
uh aku tak tahu aku bawa balik ni
uh oh my god aku tak boleh imagine aku tak boleh kau imagine reaction ayah ngan mak
tapi long distance relationship apa
dia kat singapore abeh perempuan tu kat malaysia
so they just communicate by ni ah cam telephone ah like just call
boring pe kalau tak nampak
ya long distance relationship susah
tak ah I mean I got see like couple of my friends macam they take uh long distance relationship kan then it never work out
tak lah banyak perempuan tinggalkan lelaki
a'ah legit kau tengok ah boys to men kan
it's not a norm tapi macam it's a thing
I don't know the period ah I mean dua tahun apa I's quite long dua tahun
like you nowadays very susah ah nak dapat
ah dapat yang baik
more of like a kampung kampung area I mean that's quite good
kalau future wife I will look for if she macam religious
ah religious um pandai masak
pandai masak is important yes I know I know you I know you don't know how to cook but it's a fact kakak you nak kena tengok dia punya
oh ada banyak lah I mean um looks looks kalau looks wise kan aku tak macam
tak tak kesah sangat ah boleh cakap
ya I mean looks nowadays kan kau tengok eh looks doesn't matter lah for me looks doesn't matter but most of the time guys go for looks ah which pada aku is just uh
which pada aku is just uh not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to macam
bukan aku cakap not all aku tak cakap yang all beautiful ladies
perempuan lawa is basically jahat ah tapi
kalau katakan eh like ninety per cent
kalau from my point of view lah aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi oh dia buat kawan aku macam gini oh
it give you macam a thought ah macam so perempuan lawa macam gini ah
like my like nowadays it's more of kita judge the book by its cover kan
I mean you can judge a person based on dia punya personality first tapi sekarang most of the time they judge on looks
just because dia tak lawa eh dia ni macam gini ah dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu
last time is more macam they understand each other like
macam mak ngan ayah punya time is more ah wah aku suka dia K eh she's the one for me macam gitu like
like last time people is more of a macam loyal tau sekarang is more of K ah
ya attention kalau nak cakapkan they need attention ah
because now is kita living in a modern society tau so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with faham
tu pasal ah
that's why they need attention as like macam uh pleasure
not uh pleasure ah macam how to say ah
kalau married couple for me kalau nak attention is very hard ah
tapi kalau nak cakap kan eh um
aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku attention tapi kita ah macam you're not ah giving both
kau nak selalu cakap I need attention tapi you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things apa
no ah kalau nak cakapkan piece together all of it kan is susah juga pasal
sekarang is more like kita have different thoughts different feelings kita punya emotions all jumble up
jadi kita ah
and singapore eh kalau kau nak tahu eh singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world tau serious
because of the stress that macam kita put on ourselves just to survive every month
and singapore eh have the macam the highest divorce rate
mostly melayu lah tapi
it's very hard lah because nowadays more of like dia orang um
dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan tau
they fikir okay macam orang putih cakap yolo eh
you only live once kan so they never think macam ah beyond horizon tau
dorang just fikir okay uh aku nak party ah all the way but dia nak kena fikir juga
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going macam downhill ah
so pada aku wise eh nak cakap sekarang punya zaman is more stress lah basically
tapi yang penting eh daripada drama boleh pergi marriage
I mean like is like macam uh a playhouse tau
kau boleh buat mistake tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi it's uh it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse kan
aku ada tu aku ada tu thought tau eh what if I were to become this guy this rich guy
what if I apa kata kalau aku jadi dia ni aku jadi dia tu
macam oh but it's not going to happen ah it's just that kau ada dia punya thought ah tapi end up macam kau face reality ah basically susah gila
kalau nak cakapkan drama
drama is okay cakap-cakap scripted kan
tapi aku lebih suka macam reality show
kau suka variety show variety show is most likely buat macam games talkshow api aku lebih suka macam aku tak tahu ah kalau kau tengok shark tank
it's about macam got an entrepreneur tau
entrepreneur apa pula eh
oh uh macam kau businessman
kau businessman so kau nak jual kau punya idea
ask people to support you lah macam gitu beyond this five people ah
I mean these five people at the end will uh will macam cakap ah okay aku akan sponsor kau kalau tak semua cakap big no ah
ah one of them can sponsor you two of them can sponsor jadi it depends ah on idea bagus tak
it's not voting basically macam kau datang sana kau ada idea okay kau nak orang tolong kau pasal this five people they are very uh
uh their influence is big tau and their market is big also jadi kalau kau amik dengan dia orang kan you will gain a lot
jadi that's why they a lot of people go there actually tapi that's why I like reality show it's not scripted
bondi rescue apa
kau jadi lifeguard
macam ni eh bay watch
so basically kau suka more of like cerita yang berkenaan dengan
kalau in-laws bukan adik ipar itu mertua
um brother in-law abang ipar
oh my melayu
so by the time the lifeguard actually masuk laut tu balik kan this couple dah face down
lemas ah drowning ah
abeh lifeguard tu macam sedih ah macam eh
tapi it's not their fault apa they they it's their job it's their job tapi
kadang-kadang it's not meant to be ah it's not meant to be
it's macam aku boleh cakap kan this world eh is scripted
macam K you cannot predict this one you cannot predict that one but like only god know lah macam
tuhan aje tahu when is your ajal when is your this one when is your that one
so you cannot predict ah if they are meant to die that means K ah mungkin diorang pergi somewhere better lah
oh macam err
it's ah macam mouth to mouth ah
oh that penat gila actually that one is very penat
diorang try to keep their emotion macam in check ah
it's like macam kau tahu cerita yang dulu kita masuk adam khoo workshop
pasal seratus orang dalam trap dalam bottle
abeh diorang work together just to save this one person's life
it's yang diorang actually got no where to go tapi dah ada this high macam it's a escape route escape route eh
so diorang ah cakap okay that means mungkin korang satu orang pergi keluar panggil orang datang
so diorang panggil budak ni ah budak ni pasal
it's not pasal ringan he's the
it's budak kan they they are all adults ah
kan is they kesiankan K so they so okay kau pergi panggil orang tolong kita I think about seratus orang gitu ah they all stack onto one another
then uh pangku yang budak tu ke atas then
then diorang pergi dia dapat escape ah budak tu
abeh bila dia datang balik dengan pertolongan eh it's too late
like the ninety nine people dekat botol tu kan died
that's macam gitu lah
they cannot save ya they cannot save everyone but it's great ah macam diorangnya job
guilty conscience ah betul
tak salah north depan south belakang
east kanan west kiri

okay dia daripada malaysia okay um dia punya okay estimated dia punya anggaran dia sepuluh ribu lebih okay
ya sebulan yes so kalau convert sana tiga puluh ribu ya ringgit lah tiga puluh ribu ringgit so this is
I mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing jer buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji lah I'm doing this I'm doing this for your ngaji no lah remember I take video for your masak that one I haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh lah cuma um tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok I don't know lah maybe like very slow lah kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat lah kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang kan umi nak buat kan untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah
qalqalah then you give like contoh ayat
okay then you okay ni episodenya okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain lah I don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that um
ya but kalau umi buat ni umi kena consistent lah umi tak boleh buat macam
ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi kan orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh ah tapi sekarang I think better you buat macam video yang
um boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji um
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better lah
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti lah nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji kan I mean it's on they got all the sheikh sheikh all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now lah now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh mm ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that
lepas tu ya lah that that's what you can do and then you can do a lot of things

tapi aku punya adik like don't really bake abeh tiba-tiba you want to start then you start with the hardest thing you can think of aku ingat siapa punya birthday eh aku punya maknya birthday eh
then macam dia nya plan macam fail tau dorang buat macam first batch macam tak jadi
then uh simpan dalam fridge sekejap
abeh second batch pun macam tak jadi
the capsule ah ya that one susah
like the apa ni dia nya height
abeh then you need to like coat it
oh a'ah korang exam
okay ah tapi like the past mm dua minggu tiga minggu macam kat rumah kat dalam bilik macam
dekat mana eh dekat rumah chloe eh
alah dorang dua neighbour
aku pergi sana end up aku masak mac and cheese
abeh dorang tiga tengah sibuk dengan dorang punya coffee
susah kan
tak tahu cukup bro
like I didn't cook a lot macam I cook a bit just for myself just to see apa ni
whether it's good or not lah like the combination tapi macam all four macam not that
berapa banyak then the low heat
tapi yang actually susah singapore mac and cheese is the type of cheese
the slice punya ah abeh the third one I went to
aku tak ingat ah aku beli Cold Storage kat kedai tu ah yang Cold Storage yang Fairprice Finest tu
dia ada aku beli jer ah
confirm I cannot remember nya
korang masak like during is like not really
masakan melayu kind
so that time I tried my nenek then I just ask
what was it ah some sambal
can't remember I think was like ayam masak merah
then end up the only thing yang aku ingat kan is like there already aku masak tom yum nasi goreng tom yum seh
like korang korang masak is like
like ikut measurement berapa sudu all those kind of thing
then when my nenek masak then she ajar right then she just like oh ambil sikit ambil sikit ni ni ambil lagi banyak abeh ni lagi sikit then I macam stress sia I don't even remember what is sikit what is banyak
that's why part ramadhan susah nak masak
so end up macam nak masak sayur pun depends on the age of the sayur that kind of hing
Gegar Vaganza is the one show that all the orang tua tengok
I don't know lah my datuk nenek always watching lah
but is not macam it's not macam Singapore Idol like they get new people then they is like talent is more of like already existing
ya like bring back the last time lah like hady mirza menang pe Gegar Vaganza that time
I never show you meh yang hady mirza nya
uh cinta luar biasa
okay later I show you then quite funny I saw dia nya starting that was his like second or third episode
then like he was saying he went back to Gegar Vaganza pasal like
that's why end up before that also dia buat macam
belum lagi early bro
then I will wait there duduk depan then dengan phone is like mana akid I just press record
ah dia nya kakaknya wedding ah
tak ada lah
cause dia nya cake was from my shop
aku ambil dia nya cake then I took Grab then I go there to her house ah
I think initially dorang buat they were looking at hotel tu semua
went on with it ah kat rumah but okay ah
okay lah but I never actually ask how much they spend that time aku punya kawan pun kahwin
then I think dia nya masak pun is dorang masak sendiri
dorang tak order cater tak I don't think is cater that wasn't cater pasal tak banyak orang datang
like they didn't invite a lot lah but then it's kat Zoom
then they like she invite kawan pun like secondary school just me and another person
then she invite like two of her poly friends dah tu jer then her bridesmaids lah
so it's like even as the bride herself dia tak invite banyak orang
okay ah but now banyak dorang
as in the company dorang buat is like cater hantar rumah pe
like the thing like that like that that time that mariam punya mak
with some you know the you remember the the the link that afiq sent to the silat group
about some gym bag yang you can sign up
tapi nak cakap apa eh
melayu aku err melayu aku melayu aku sekarang pun aku sekarang tiba-tiba tak boleh berbual
oh okay okay saya faham saya faham
it's just quite funny then wah my cat just manja like you know no tomorrow you know
okay but you know esok I tomorrow I have a meeting again
no not silat only I responded sia
cause I cause I'm reading the mail now apa
ya lah memang bukan main-main tapi afiq ada cakap pasal err kan syaz dapat kerja baru then syaz ah dia cakap macam aku boleh rasa afiq dah tak ikhlas sekarang
no tapi so aku tanya dia like kenapa dia err
okay so like I ask afiq like why he keep why does he keep holding this on macam for so long then he said that uh because syaz just got a new job then he doesn't want to err like ruin her spirit ah or something like that I don't know then I'm like that's damn that's damn bastard lah serious like damn bastard
I don't know I think they wanted to go out makan or something and then like they wanted to like because amar didn't want to be like so exclusive then he wanted to invite the two of us
because we have to keep we have to fill up the one hour usually when we talk we don't fill it up what it's like kita ada we have blanks you know
so amacam eh amacam so how
faham tapi itu so basikal bapa dia apa
ah takkan faz minta izin bapa dia habis bapa dia tak boleh ikut
ugh kenapa
apa yang okay
tapi kita nak berbual pasal apa eh
apa just just ini cakap nak berbual
apa yang kau merepek eh
eh kau punya melayu rabak juga eh
kau just just berhenti bercakap okay apa kamu
tapi aku dah lama tak berbual melayu macam gini ah so susah juga ah
kau nak kau nak kau asyik berbual bahasa baku jer that's why kekok
tercakap bahasa inggeris ah
memusnahkan recording ini recording dalam bahasa melayu apa
so kita sekarang tengah merakam pe
kenapa dah lama tahu bahasa melayu kan jadi macam gini
yang tertiba okay okay aku faham aku faham
err aku just tak faham ah kau nak cakap apa eh
dulu kita err apa eh
apa yang kau tengah berbual eh
ya allah susah
kenapa kau kena pakai saya awak ini ah
oh gitu
okay jadi kita nak berbual pasal apa sekarang
boleh juga lah kita buat gitu
kau asyik cakap benda just
kenapa eh
aku rasa tak ah
tapi sekarang ini kita speak in full sentences ke
ah okay ah macam gitu ah
dude your oh my god your malay sounds so kekok
kenapa eh
but macam mana you terkeluar Zoom
okay tak apa I I ajar you macam mana nak pakai Zoom dulu cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
okay lepas tu kena sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I punya sign in is just under sign in with tapi kalau you punya personal I would think you have to um sign in pakai
your own email lah tak okay but let's just pretend macam you ada your own email okay
okay so like selalunya when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will macam send you a link kan then like from from the link you you just
select you can see like my background kat sini kan you it's apa um it's virtual screen so maknanya my background takleh nampak lah
kalau kalau messy kalau
so you can change like your virtual background ah at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I selalu pakai virtual background cause belakang messy kan so I don't want to like show my background so kalau it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
tak ni dah log in dah
so uh you can also add in your own photo so for me I macam I create I even created my own background just to
bagi lawa lah so I I use this
tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni kan it's
so background is done and then um apa lagi nak tahu
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet dengan iPad I think ah ya
I'm not sure about um apa not android apa nama dia Windows punya laptop but
so kalau I pakai desktop kan
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp punya web
ya but if I pakai if I choose the Google chrome punya kan
so even kalau macam I tengah pakai Google chrome lepas tu I open WhatsApp web
dia tak akan nampak I punya WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome punya err window
so like this would be hard macam uh once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just um
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know selalu macam
you selalu cakap then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper orang boleh dengar
and then it goes the same for the video lah kalau your video takde they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me dalam class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
ni lah
tak yang tunjuk you tadi
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad dia akan tanya kalau you nak err apa
macam for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers tadi um
so even kalau even kalau dia
so kalau you pakai video kan
uh apa nama dia
actually you can see yourself lah kat tepi
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are apa the video is done I mean the video is off
apa done
and then other basic things is like macam
raise up your hands or err apa
okay I don't really have it oh dengan yes no
okay so they will just ask oh ah who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just angkat tangan
tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini lah
apa rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
so record is just you boleh tengok balik lah the recording
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record macam macam that time I conduct my master classes right
macam movie gitu
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then susah lah
ya then lepas tu I just um I tried out uh record on cloud
then orang akan just
ya orang akan be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
chat ah okay cause ni tak ada participants sekarang kan so
mm then you know you can change err to everyone ataupun to a specific person
mm tak boleh
tapi kan ada orang cakap yang like what like the host who
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer kat dalam kelas lah ya
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message kan you have to make sure yang apa you you click back to everyone
tapi kan sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages uh your and messages apa to everyone
ya so you just have to macam baca betul-betul lah like which one is everyone which one is to you only
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to apa to to my friend ah
breakout rooms is just uh macam tadi you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of macam
lepas tu orang tu nak breakout into smaller groups to do group work
macam create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant bila I tengah tengah tengok
cause for adults I don't think you guys pakai much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks apa
ya so if you like uh if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say macam I conduct my fundraising master classes kan the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
mm I think it's better than apa what's the other option the outlook is it live live
but it's so susah just now
no but like but like what was your apa what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room ada virtual
I tak
I tak pernah pergi lah but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
cakap lah
apa it's the starting of the
I mean technically it's in the poem also what so like even if you baca like
but this is done by the escape room punya punya company lah
oh so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator macam team bonding facilitator right
cause cause got my for my global studies punya apa
no it's like macam okay basically if it's physical kan in school then they will give you like nearing to exams lah macam your apa midterms or your final year then they will give you like err a literal goody bag
then inside macam ada foolscap ada snacks ada like ya then like all these are like
err apa get
promote ah sponsorship ah sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship lah but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty punya goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small apa faculty group kan
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but um is to try out our apa
um room punya fee
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run dulu lah
tak tak tak kita play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you nak orang uh you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want what kan ya
you have to source out for the for the people lah but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android punya phone
and then cause at first they tried to apa
E-vouchers for apa three different three different categories macam welfare eh welfare pula beauty uh food and macam activities lah like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end macam I think they just decided
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to macam we tried to
apa delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships tak reply cause COVID sekarang then even their organisations not doing well apa the companies not doing well
like even like activity punya entertainment places pun tak not
ya then now I just finished my fundraising punya series oh
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first macam kita
we just like no confidence ah macam it's so susah
uh members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism lah he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also macam donate in bulks what like you and mama
seventy per cent seventy per cent pula seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot what
just you sorang jer
apa embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think macam is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that one a bit but in the end err a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class macam it's not that bad lah ya
cause it was still macam ramai then she was like oh my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like oh ha ha ha nasib baik cause there's only like
three people yang sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people yang sign up
from the faculty punya group
oh at first he I don't really know him but I just tahu pasal he lives in my for
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance macam I saw his uh
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time pasal
ah this excel course lah pastu I macam and I wanted to join that time tapi I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
I was dengan tengah planning for this fundraising I was thinking like hmm like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought macam I think
err apa
not hands-on macam very practical skills that people would need macam in their workplaces in their school right
he was just like ya sure sure lepas tu I I went to find out err he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like oh my god so kesian then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
dah I told him already but
two and half cause the maximum kita anuh is
actually I don't even know what's abang doing
like what what what did he macam in the end
oh bukan as in what is he selling like what kan dia
oh macam
macam GrabFood lah
so it's it's just plain rice chicken dengan just different sauce
mana seh
I don't know I just go novena untuk err skin centre
ya but the soft launch abang nak buat apa
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court ke in a
in a shopping mall ke
okay lah like atas atas punya food court cause I heard like there's apa
err pasal it's this semester is all online kan I didn't even step in school like for one moment
err go back to school to study apa
no at first cannot sekarang dah boleh
but jauh
you boleh tampines hub is the most not conducive environment ever
it's so bising you ever went there before
it's so bising like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay lah understand but like
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside yang kat atas semua it's so hard
but like two hours macam so sikit if I want to study there
ya and then nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun
some establishments macam Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
tapi it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam err my job punya module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to cam use all these
your laptop semua kan
even if you have friends macam
paiseh kan nak tanya
so it's usually like like apa a combination of err topics
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought macam lebih lebih bagus ah
uh non exam modules and two exams pastu I macam happy lah yay three three modules no exam
ah ambil kau semua submission at the same time cause usually
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually lah err the macam apa submission the deadline is
tak tahu kenapa lah but it's just like that ah
but the assignment like most of my assignments here um especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating nya assignment
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy punya mod
my major apa
so you you bayangkan I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
semua yes you see
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same sama-sama
macam now
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you tak percaya you tanya kak shima the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just belajar for that one
uh like you belajar for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
I just got my I just go my apa
twenty third november baru end
then cause different assignments is different weightages apa
like like I think it's cause macam they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
mesti I macam huh
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we dapat results you macam
lagi cepat stress
you naik year three year four it gets harder and harder what you have to take harder modules kan
I just want to macam freeze my lah so that it won't macam tak turun tak naik I mean I mean naik is possible it's very hard for you to naik lah honestly
ya tak turun lah basically
dorang nak tunggu vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already lah but unfortunately tak ada vaccine
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round punya dah actually dah tutup
but then they just buka balik then they said oh it's until oh it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so macam tak kira kalau you ada you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
my major punya requirement is that
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like macam group work
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out lah I tak boleh pergi lah
mm so sem one but my course my my major ada this requirement that you kena ambil this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so kalau you miss out in sem one tak boleh ambil in sem two jer tau
two uh apa different modules from two different universities
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a macam group work gitu ya
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with um just like err apa nama dia
uh doing online kalau boleh
if you are apa namanya I lost my train of thoughts already ayah keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling pula it's actually trying to like
take two different err from two different schools macam macam mana you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
I don't really have hope yang kita akan pergi lah cause it's ya it's quite hard
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is macam tak baik lah like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
no kalau kalau
kalau one kalau one year then I won't lah like no and and it's not just them it's like
the faculty I mean my major macam just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but the the new application yang dorang kasi it's more
apa there's more options ah
kena submit lagi ah
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject apa and you and you won't
you've been looking forward to this but nasib baik I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what takde
know like kak shima stay in the hall everything
what it what people are mad about is like macam the the college tak
they don't they don't dia tak relay apa-apa
only after two weeks they reported baru ada like
the laki lah
it took two weeks just to macam do something then that speaks a lot what
jap eh ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni
jap jap and then after that like they and then we were like
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know macam sensation lah like the media just wants to like keep on uh saying oh again
no but but in but kita punya people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
um wow that sounds great aku past few days aku tak buat apa-apa yang menarik sangat aku cuma duduk dekat rumah jer tengok
janganlah kita buang duit nak beli handphone yang mahal-mahal tapi tak ada lah beza sangat dengan handphone yang lama kan
mostly kalau aku boleh mimpi lah satu hari healthcare percuma lah untuk semua orang
susah kan dia orang nak afford untuk bayar dia orang punya hospital bills kan
nenek saya pun masuk hospital pun dah beberapa dah beberapa kali pasal sakit pasal jatuh
pun tak murah lah kan nak bayar dia punya itu
um obviously as of right now I don't think it's possible for anybody to be invisible so you know who knows maybe one day in the future kita boleh hilangkan diri eh in a way that
kalau aku pun aku memang nak lah sebab macam dia kata kalau during exams kalau lah masa O level aku boleh baca minda orang eh yang duduk depan aku itu budak pandai itu kalau aku boleh baca minda dia mana tahu aku punya results lagi bagus daripada sekarang ke
ya betul-betul boleh baca minda kawan lah kalau dia tengah tipu ke kalau dia tengah jujur ke tak tahu lah kalau orang ini berbual merepek ke you know I mean I guess mind reading is I'd say is pretty powerful to be honest but who knows maybe someday
yang pertama if kalau boleh aku nak
dapat cepat-cepat belajar apa-apa bahasa dalam dunia lah sebab pertama sekali um daripada kecil dulu pergi kelas madrasah selalu dapat dan sudah dapat belajar bahasa arab tapi sampai sekarang pun masih tak boleh err nak cakap satu ayat pun dalam bahasa arab sebab berapa susah nak belajar
so kalau ada peluang bahasa arab
bahasa german dengan italian
aku kalau boleh lah kalau dapat lah nak cuba
um master lah dengan beberapa cepat lah yang kedua kalau boleh saya nak
um belajar masak dengan betul-betul baik
macam faidil kata tadi dia boleh look up to orang macam gordon ramsay yang memang hebat sekali bila masak tapi kalau saya saya tak
ikut lah gordon ramsay kalau boleh pun saya nak ikut emak saya sahaja sebab dia memang satu inspirasi bagi saya dan
kalau saya dah ada berumahtangga kalau ada bini ke saya tak nak bini saya tanggung semua tanggungjawab untuk masak untuk kita dan anak-anak kita so
mana tahu dua tiga minggu sekali saya boleh nak memasak untuk anak kita dan iya lah dapat senangkan untuk semua orang
movie romantic ini memang aku suka lah sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini I mean iya lah kalau kalau aku nangis kan memang dapat rasa emosi dia lah bila tengok orang berlakon
tapi macam drama-drama melayu pun banyak dekat tiga ke malaysia astro ke dapat tengok
kebanyakkan cerita romantis kelakar lah tapi
memang aku suka lah
dengan um iya lah I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to ah
kalau aku ada time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
jadi aku boleh iya lah kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok lah gambar-gambar tersebut kan
and iya lah fikir lah masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak stress kan dalam hidup
kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
whoa memang menarik itu jawapan dia
I mean duit itu memang penting lah kalau aku aku pun nak duit lah seratus billion dollars itu memang
tak tahu lah nak buat apa eh dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia
um dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang
aku akan wish untuk semua orang
dengan stable ah sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah
dunia ini pun semakin um semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk survive kan
so yang pertama I would wish for poverty to end cause
I mean ya um liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but aku rasa chelsea itu memang aku dah lama lah sokong so aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku
aku memang aku memang jealous lah yang liverpool menang title tahun lepas
tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku control chelsea sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan so iya lah kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar lah eh
kegemaran lah yang
eh nasi pula lauk lemak
and aku and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
kalau kalau boleh I want to become a journalist cause
iya lah betul lah memang
betul betul betul betul judgemental kan sekarang
so kalau aku boleh pilih
kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat lah
daripada muka yang handsome lah
aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat lah sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada
lebih baik lah untuk orang lain kan
kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul handsome ke
apa that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
um I just why aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang
memang laju lah untuk senang kata lah memang laju memang banyak stress banyak yang nak buat
dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih stress
culture di pada negara-negara di asia lah sebab iya lah benda macam um kesihatan mental ini memang
bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat lah
untuk ibu bapa kan sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita kan tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah lah jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan mental sebagai sesuatu yang penting lah
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but tak boleh so
yang one way or another has been at fault
um when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada kindergarten sampai sekarang dekat sekolah poly ambil diploma
um dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada bill yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara um dekat sini pun um healthcare macam dekat polyclinic ke dekat hospital pun
kita punya apa dia kita punya government kita dapat tolong dapat cover kan dapat bantu and ada um as someone who has two siblings with special needs
and um with that both of us would like to say thank you and have a nice day thank you terima kasih bye bye

hi uh my name is rismah I'm eighteen years old this year and my birthday is coming so tolonglah belikan present ke apa ke
err lagi err
kebanyakan buah lah sebab err cause I like mango and
oval kot
ada yang oval ada yang bulat tergantung ah
tergantung buah dia nak grow macam mana
uh itu jer
itu jer kot sebab
betul lah kata err abang saya ini dia
ada yang bengkok ada yang straight
ada juga mango yang panjang kalau kau orang pernah nampak lah but then
itu jer
sebab mango ini kan it's very very sweet and
jangan cakaplah bila okay ah kadang uh nak makan mango ini ada kalau kau orang pernah lah
err kadang ada yang tersangkut dekat gigi lah
ada yang terselit dekat sana sini lah sebab kan dia orang punya apa itu
cause mango pun dia punya biji dia ada macam tali
so nanti dia orang terstuck dekat gigi ke apa ke but
other than that macam it's really really sweet and okay kalau kau orang nak tahu
cakap tadi yang ada colour
apa oren lah hijau lah merah lah kalau korang nak tahu um hijau is mango um mangga muda
um means uh mango yang masih belum masak lah and if you want to know the sweetest mango is the red mango
ah kalau kau orang nampak red mango itu lah mango paling sedap dalam dunia
so kenapa dia favourite sebab mango they're just relaxing they just
dia macam very juicy boleh buat juice and
oh banyak pun ada giant pun ada
ah cold storage pun banyak so
but macam macam ah nak cari mango ini dekat dingapore memang senang gila
so um jangan jangan apa
err pergi try lah I mean pergi try makan mango kalau siapa siapa yang tak suka makan mango pergi try confirm akan tambah lagi
mesti ada confirm because
so people will confirm keluarkan product product mango um like lip balm ke yang rasa mango
atau lipstick yang rasa mango kita mana tahu kan betul tak
lagi um
lagi err apa
mesti lah
mesti ada macam bingsu ada flavour mango
habis lepas itu um recently my friend bawa kan uh I
apa eh um I think it's a mango float I uh they call it mango float
so dalam pun ada mango and
every single dessert eh confirm for me ada mango punya
sebab kalau tak ada mango tak sah that's me okay kalau tak ada mango tak sah mesti ada mango punya kalau
tak ada mango tak nak makan
kan betul tak
ada diabetes uh diabetes ke it's also good for their health tahu kalau dia orang nak makan mango pun
sebab it's a fruit it's bukan makanan manis it's not too sweet it's not too bitter so
boleh uh mango ni boleh dimakan dari segi um budak dari budak budak sampai lah ke orang tua
and ya like I said it's very very healthy so kalau boleh kau orang makan lah mango and
mango ni colour dia yellow tahu colour dia unique gila and
colour dia is macam matahari macam apa
apa word itu um macam um apa menyinari eh apa
uh ah like macam dia just
and bila kalau um like my brother said ada mango mango tea eh
kalau telan itu fulamak dekat dalam tekak boleh rasa sampai dekat dalam badan it's really really really refreshing guys so kau orang kena try mango kalau kau orang tak pernah try
um recipe eh recipe mungkin um I tak tahu eh
tapi um
siapa siapa tahu buat mango juice senang gila just pecah-pecahkan mango
ah letak ice and letak air sikit dah jadi mango juice
so that's adalah err itu adalah satu ah recipe yang kau orang boleh try
um tak tahu nama dia mango apa lah terserah kan kau orang lah nak namakan apa tapi mango itu macam mango juice sedap gila
apa lagi eh err atau tak nak buat mango cake
tak pernah ada orang buat mango cake
boleh letak mango buah-buah dia semua
um hias cantik-cantik err colour pun kuning sama macam mango
atau chef chef yang dekat luar sana yang tahu buat mango cake ah bentuk dia betul-betul macam mango dia punya texture dia design dia semua ah pun boleh juga
oh kau orang pernah try mango puff
mango puff pun ada dia orang jual dekat um
maybe polar ke dekat um
prima deli ke
there's um cakap pasal recipe
uh and berbual pasal cakes and stuff I think um
kau kalau kau orang yang dengar macam lapar juga eh
I tak tahu lah recipe apa yang ada untuk mango tapi um
mango tak ada recipe lah like you can do whatever you want with mango you can smash it you can just eat it
and bukan makanan jer yang dia orang keluarkan dia orang keluarkan syrup juga
betul tak I mean like they uh they they they
untuk like special ah special occasions ke atau like special events ke atau tak
it's just so nice that macam like
err like we love mango everyday we eat mango tapi
so bila
I also macam like
oh dengan mango mango eh oh banyak sekali um
after you keluarkan from the freezer
I just tak tahu ah macam suka sangat lah err mango yang it's very very cold so
bila telan kan when I eat this mango right when it's cold
I just feel so so so refreshed macam tekak ini sejuk gila especially when it's during hot days like sunny days
cooling mango oh my god it's just refreshing so much betul tak
lagi-lagi when
really really really really satisfying you know macam
bila tengah berpeluh eh tengah like
just finished err doing some activities with your families dekat park ke and everything then this
err ice cream seller tiba-tiba datang and then jual you ice cream and then you bought this you buy this uh ice cream punya eh um mango ice cream
then you telan during these summer days
tengok my accent pun dah jadi woo macam sebab dah sedap sangat dalam otak ini walaupun tak makan
I pun tak tahu so because
kalau dekat sekolah ada kerja I'm just going to do it
but when dekat rumah macam tiba-tiba nak
like cause mostly kita kan kita semua ada practical kita semua ada theory
and kalau kat sekolah ada practical I will always do it and kalau dekat rumah ah like he said home based learning
kalau ada theory
I'm just going to revise ah if tak then I'm just going to listen to whatever
cikgu explain ke or
other subjects ke other topics I'm just going to listen
but other than that I think kalau dekat sekolah I'm productive kot because mostly I'm doing
tak pernah malas ah tak tak pernah sekali malas ah
malas pun kalau dah penat kalau dah shag gila
tapi um my last meal
entah I I I I come back
jangan cakap lah eh I think my favourite food for now it's um chicken chop
black pepper dia orang is just
ada rasa lah like confirm ada rasa punya lah macam
tak boleh describe ah sebab sedap sangat you know macam nak makan sekarang juga you know something like that have you ever felt like that way when you talk about your favourite food and then you feel like you're hungry right now
betul-betul gila I mean like
kita macam tak berbual pasal makan pun we're still hungry
apa lagi kalau tengok kalau tengah tengah penat eh habis tengah lapar habis scroll instagram
oh my god macam dah itu tak apa sedap pula itu and
lagipun it's very rare for us to find in singapore so
hais buat lapar jer
I don't know if you guys tahu ke tak syafiq kyle
he's a malaysian um actor and dia pernah main dekat cerita nur
as dalam dekat cerita nur ini
dia main sebagai um
as an ustad
dia baru balik jordan for um untuk apa
err mengetahui lagi uh lebih lanjut dia punya pengetahuan sebagai ustad lah like
he wants to become an ustad you know because his family is really really pious well he came from a pious family
with a what do you call pelacur
dia nak cari err apa
dia nak cari err
so I think this cerita boleh you know
dari cerita nur because cerita nur is mostly all about err religious yang
siapa-siapa yang suka tengok cerita yang you know ada ustad habis ada you know macam
yang suka dengar ah ayat-ayat suci al-quran
you can just uh pergi tengok cerita nur because
apa lagi bila syafiq kyle tengah
fuh syafiq kyle tengah baca al-quran
merdu gila like
banyak lagi ah my ah I have a polaroid of him
I hope kau orang yang tahu situation COVID nineteen ini
tolong lah pakai mask eh tak mahu tak mahu tak pakai mask
because wati sounds like you know bibik bibik punya nama
macam makcik-makcik punya nama you know like bibik wati no please no I mean only only my families can but not my friends okay not
sampai december and I'll be graduating already and I think I'm planning to take um maybe
err talking about language err languages ah I can speak macam biasa melayu
then nanti you nak tengok cerita apa
Greenland apa lagi
to be honest kan I don't know how they record
like macam mana macam mana dia orang record
so then tiba tiba kerja continue continue continue then err
but what if they start recording okay tak apa ah then that means the movie wouldn't be out what
I mean pernah lah macam let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel kan
then macam oh disney channel then got mulan then tengok ah then like oh whatever
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad macam rasa
disappointed pasal anak dia perempuan so tak ada orang yang boleh carry on
okay what do you mean by terpaksa because if she's terpaksa kan okay at first she's a guy eh she's a woman
tak tak pernah tengok that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
she she sakit then she baring I think sick or whatever I don't know
orang tengah berbual pasal mulan
oh so even okay the dad tak boleh pasal dia sakit
tapi in the in that government even though kau sakit ke apa eh sorry
even though if you sakit
okay even if you sakit or not tak kisah you have to go is that the rule
so the the mulan dia macam kasihan kan that's why she left that note
oh what to curi
no tak the first wish yang dia buat is dia nak jadi prince
I think bukan renovation it's just macam err
ya there's no one tapi that time eh that time I went is before corona is it
cause they I think pasal dia orang dah tukar eh
yang wave wave pool the big one
dia macam very mundane the wave not really like power
no longkang longkang yang jalan sendiri lazy pool
ah longkang longkang
and the actual olympic punya swimming
you you try move your apa ni paket you taruh depan you
pasal kalau you tengok you punya sound wave kan dia macam when you kill let's say
grey tuan
oh cause my one dia gerak banyak seh maybe because my voice is loud ah
okay okay you see ah my my wave besar tahu
I I jauh begini pun boleh dengar
there was this one girl yang
I was with macam sama sekolah
so kita just grow like from nursery K one eh
nursery K one K two whatever whatever whatever kan sampai P six
then my adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas
so then dia orang macam kacau kacau my adik kan adik dia lah
kalau they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume yang kau orang ada benda
ya so begitu jer lah tapi
it was just like macam
a topic in macam mak bapa berbual
bila primary six
kan then I tak tahu kenapa ah
then macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa
ya allah eh wait eh belum habis eh jap
ya so macam uh apa ni
suka nak jumpa that kind of thing
macam cute kan P six
eh eh eh eh dia ni
ni what do you mean by you like the person you like err you eh
I thought eh sia ah dini gerek sia kalau dengan dia pun best
but I think I think my one is amplified eh like berbual
tak pasal I berbual biasa tahu this is considered normal to me tahu but then it's like
you know there's in a group there's that one that takes charge macam let's say kalau you nak keluar
there's that one guy okay lah kita gini ah then everyone macam okay ah go ah no problem macam yes
actually when the robot tu dengar gemuk
then the robot dengan dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk
so ya there's leader ni
actually just just two people tahu
so macam let's say okay
so everywhere they go kan ah okay lah jom ah like then okay lah pergi makan ah okay lah jom ah jom ah main bola ah
okay okay lah go ah that kind of ya so macam primary school what I did was

then I laugh back lah he was like ha ha kenapa lah buat joke macam gitu

dia cakap okay okay okay nevermind ah you just you you don't you don't so loud ah you just pay attention in class ah then I was like okay okay okay then hang up
then I masuk class kan semua tanya ah I remember seh
tengok eh what did you do
ya that's why macam tak kena
eh dah lama tak jumpa
yeah I'm just my friend is just to find a jobs lah flexible part time jobs you know to suit my schedule especially like my intern is not paid right  abih kena cari kerja sendiri lah
 asal boring what you doing at home
yes it almost three years already and we are gonna graduate next year  tak sabar rasanya
stress kan  kena buat ni semua but I'm glad  macam its all over already lah now dah holiday  boleh enjoy
 apa was the assignment about duh
 apa itu I tak faham
err so far only  satu je lah like one module err we learn about airport management it's quite interesting lah cause you get to learn about the operations behind a airports right like how the run or what what other things involved yeah
oh my dream job is to be stewardess lah like cause  macam you know that time the first time I took a flight to penang then the stewardess served me right then from there I was like inspired I want to be like them
so from there  macam I work hard lah to you know I do research about aviation about stewardess all these
yeah that was one of my dreams  tapi macam susah lah  nak jadi pilot you need a lot of qualification yeah so now I just want to be a stewardess first lah I see lah if
I want to work at singapore airlines lah but  banyak orang cakap susah nak masuk ah because high standard  semua so now I looking for maybe other travel budget airlines like the Scoot or Jetstar asia
oh sekarang ni I I tengah tengok drama korea ah korea ah cerita lama lah cerita legend of the blue sea
just now I eat ah  nasi with  kari daging
wah  sedap nya
 boleh jugak your mom  masak semua
 macam hari raya pulak
yeah but then like my other friends they  banyak kena campak dekat err company  yang tak related to aviation  macam logistics then like some of them will be like under administration or marketing that kind of job
 belum susah cause  aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc kind of job kan  tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard lah I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the changi airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
yeah because because like I said lah like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya lah a bit  takut ah when if you talk then you will talk alone
good lah was it a  macam manageable or stressful
 abih kau macam mana macam ada plans  nak buat business eh
tak they see eh I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers lah
just like the other cafes  semua those that sell the mains all yeah
 sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere ulu somewhere err a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the ulu places right then people want to
and cannot be ulu lah like I said
 sekarang
you mean like malay food  ke
 tauhu bergedil lah I I love that  tauhu bergedil then what else ah bubble tea the what ah oh that time I saw err dalgona bubble tea or something
yeah mostly all at bugis east area like you said lah in the west also not much  halal options cause very boring lah east is the best lah because they have a lot of good food there
a'ah  kalau kereta senang boleh pergi mana mana jer  jauh jauh pon takpe because very convenient
 selalu pergi lah  kadang kadang malam malam ikut err  abah aku pergi isi minyak isi minyak kereta err  pastu kita orang gi makan burger or we go McDonald's right then eat their burger is so nice duh I like their McDonald's menu
yeah but Ramly  dari sana but then I don't like because err  banyak sayur
oh I I've eaten before um  apa tu
it it is okay leh not is like it is a bit like err  ayam and  daging ah
I mean  daging beef a bit a bit like that it just a bit  keras
there's also err burger  arnab
I don't know why I was daring to try that deer meat lah you know cause like I'm there already so  mak I say just try something new because I like to explore what I like to try new food
then that stall also they got sell the  ais kacang
 senang ah  nak cari makanan halal untuk kita
ah I miss also I want to go the  tapak food truck
yeah like the food range for maybe seven  ringgit onwards
that time I bought the buttermilk chicken rice it's ten  ringgit
talking about  nasi lemak I remember that time I went
 abih err  kita orang makan  nasi lemak  dengan lauk lauk lauk pauk you know  nasi lemak then I I  taruk err  ayam of course  ayam ah  ayam goreng
then  taruk like some other  lauk ah like the  sambal telur you know  sambal kerang wah it's really nice
 halal food options so it's so easy for us to find  halal food so like at our hotel right err just across the street there's already like two to three  halal restaurants then as you go down the street there is more option for you lah
 tak I  pergi jogjakarta
 mertabak manis
 sedap gila seh I  suka gila
I've been getting a lot of comments  macam bapak aku dengan pak cik aku cakap eh dah dah dah  apa eh
uh huh dah  tembam
confirm boring lah your house  takde pape nak buat kan  takde three lah  takde
but then we just ignore it then we set up our picnic mat and all lah then  sekali like a few minute after that we can see like on the right side the clouds are very dark and
 sedap it just fruits lah for nothing less berries blueberries that kind of berries
no this is five dah lama
 tapi cause we are too small and mostly is
bila ah staycation
this one you planning to do for kak ain's birthday right
makan kat mana for dinner
central area lagi kalau nak makan
boleh masak Maggi
I think you all can go jalan-jalan dekat gardens by the bay before that
usually like who want to bangun pagi I cannot bangun pagi man
eh kalau staycation
have you been to the yang itu the art museum
because they have that interacting punya
I forgot the time she I think the one that mama went with kak ain dekat
japan kat tokyo they went to the japan one
then mama cakap ada
like this one this macam interacting nya board gitu so you can draw your own animals
oh then she excited macam budak kecil
since dah macam central central
and then your parents boleh
feeling sikit
because I think dekat Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
actually tengok-tengok date lah but then if you book december right you can use your voucher mah
is do you think aryan is old enough to masuk
mm then can boleh pakai seh
but you went to Malayan Council before right to makan
makan dekat sana ada that Noosh Noodle Bar
ah if you go the if you go the the art museum kan dah dekat like you walk through the helix bridge lepas tu dah belok
then dah sampai esplanade what esplanade kan][dah dekat
and nak kalau nak mengopi ada coffee bean
and then boleh jalan-jalan can take photos
yang dekat omotesando
like you know the japanese they very macam
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it dia dah toast panas-panas
then lepas tu the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
ya I feel like semua orang cakap it's um expensive lagi mahal but then I feel like if you record eh uh record pula if you um
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one dekat japan because dekat japan they have the regular size and size
dekat sini they only have size
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people nya mindset macam
ni lagi mahal seh
ah berbual for what
kat japan boleh makan pe but now you're not going japan right so
because I see dekat macam online blog gitu I feel like it's
okay lah dia macam tak lokek
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one yang tanya what is yakiniku
dekat the place itself
so they give you raw beef dia macam Seoul Garden Seoul Garden tapi it's just beef
I had the one dekat japan also it was so good the halal one
so we went and then we went for um during lunch time dia macam tak crowded even though there's so many people at the
and then they had dish macam dish eh
they had this macam
um raw beef set like the bento tapi with raw beef
then the griller dekat depan
so you get to grill your own tapi it's like a bento
dish is like lauk right
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the roti
but it's a dish mah so I thought it's um macam should be included
okay I think I will choose um clam vongole mama punya clam vongole
with lots of cili padi and um
confirm rumah dia besar eh
like have you seen um will smith punya rumah
it's like tingkat bertingkat and then kat belakang ada swimming pool
uh apa tu
will smith punya rumah punya gambar
dorang jalan jauh-jauh pun they will stay around their house
ada macam living room a'ah
dia just kekal
you can be tak handsome but then have a good uh fit body tapi I'm like
once you have a fit body kalau muka tak handsome then I'm like
like you see some model pun macam
eh badan dia buff seh sekali dia pusing ah kau
genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
my favourite channel is the crime investigation channel dekat rumah
tapi sekarang dah tak ada seh
uh like for example conjuring dengan annabelle
because dia macam okay they want to act
make it macam as if oh betul betul happening betul betul like
abeh macam if you macam fikir balik like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven gitu
I mean it's a good macam
maybe dulu is a good macam good thing for a change lah
don't know I like the way she tells the story macam very interesting like she doesn't macam she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't macam
macam tak boring gitu
you know some people nanti dorang macam berbual berbual
and then halfway it gets boring because macam too draggy
tapi and then this
ya I I finished all the ones dekat Facebook
dekat YouTube is still ongoing
there's this one movie dekat Netflix
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix macam a few years ago I thought dia baru keluar
because dulu when
dia keluar bila two thousand eight kan eh two thousand eighteen
the movie keluar
why recently Netflix macam dorang released so many macam documentaries
tomorrow kerja petang seh I think malam that malam after since tutup I think I can watch
macam dah lama nak lah like you wish
so dari kecil sampai sekarang you like
rumah besar as in like
so like balas jasa gitu
tapi dulu when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school kot lupa
ya then dia tak serabak now lah like
tapi COVID is like
from one country then lepas tu another country then lepas tu tiba-tiba like the whole world sampai
airports semua tutup sia like
like tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this macam seriously
tu ah
I mean tapi sekarang re-election so I feel like
tapi macam tu lah I mean korang nak the COVID to finish
to end to finally like macam
no more new cases tu semua everybody to heal
until tak nak dengar like to wear mask wash your hands
tapi orang tak nak dengar then like
esok kerja eh
esok kerja petang seh
you know my tempat kerja ada budak baru
it's a malay guy then he budak T
he's on internship and because I thought when he masuk
usually kalau
oh I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so macam terkejut like oh you from polytechnic I'm like oh ya
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the macam
like you know the courses tu semua how the works tapi macam
macam sensitive issue lah because they usually macam
deal with macam money money um orang bayarkan
dorang bayar duit tu join courses tu semua so maybe they like
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes ke apa ke
so they will only let the senior yang kerja lama kat sana tu
so kita orang usually ada
kita duduk counter jer kat
ya lah dekat office ah
so dah passion card layan tu ni but then
to um apa tu apply for you know the
under macam not everything can buat right
a'ah especially kalau macam the
issue is about government punya duit like government bagi duit because of this COVID right so they'll think like
they already like refer them to us then after that kita orang macam then they come to the then after that we tell them that
then you know macam tak happy lah
ya then after that the other day got this one makcik lah she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
we cannot even like use other people punya computer
your issue lah tapi macam for us is sensitive because
sekali kalau apa-apa ya
sekali your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
jap tengok dia punya battery
ya so I said go to but then dorang cakap ah very far I cannot walk and all
oh but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit leceh so far
adik stop
dia cakap she applied
uh apa tu she passed away
that means the person punya mum
but then they keep like arguing macam
especially if it's like racial issue macam
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a makcik who came
if there's a makcik who come by
tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita kan melayu
so it's like that my kerja is like that
uh as a housing officer dekat dormitory punya office
mm I'll be in the office lor so basically kalau that office is for the foreign workers kalau let's say they have
pay them on time ke apa like this kind of problem they will come to the office and tu
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing macam roundings ke apa ke so you like
dia kata macam you know macam Expo event but every day
eh medical interview pula the medical check-up
dorang berbual english
orh okay tu tempat landed landed nya tempat oh okay okay
then kalau macam
so that means the classes macam
like let's say if the that means one teacher ada fifteen right then means half of that
macam like around tujuh ke lapan orang then halfway dorang uh balik tidur
they also belajar
usually macam after dorang punya macam so called
before that makan ke lepas tu makan
oh dorang makan dulu eh orh so macam
then makan
jaga budak ya I think it's
dia macam malu eh
cakap lah kau nak cakap dulu ke aku cakap dulu
eh abeh yang sulaiman tu
kau cakap apa dia ajak kau gi ubi eh gi pancing
but which part of pulau ubin kau pergi pancing
apa yang dekat jetty
is it the place that that time you saw me and my friend pancing
kampung melayu ada satu jer kan
then after that malam tu kau dapat ikan
kat hidung wah
aiya ya ya ya tu jer satu ikan potong steam
then lepas tu sulaiman jumpa kau kat sana ke dia jumpa kau kat singapore
then kau pancing from what time to what time
but you you go there with no intention of pancing ah
the place where you guys pancing was a a man made structure then but why he asked whether you want to stay there because when I air pasang all all around you semua
but if pasang betul you guys habis lah
sepuluh malam nine oh ya moon right
oh enjoy enjoy but then you guys got bring tempat duduk ah
backpack bikin tempat duduk
I go pancing actually pancing that time yang kau nampak aku tu dekat apa tempat dekat dengan office kau lah that time ah that one that one I don't remember we catch much lah but got one that's opposite apa crab island eh
ah pulau ketam that one we we caught like berapa enam enam ekor ikan bapa duri apa
is is middle of jahan eh johan
I know the biggest one is jahan tak ke ke ikan oh duri is the middle one lah
ya so it's what what's the small keli eh keli duri jahan
bukan johan johan nama orang
johan tu nama orang ini jahan ya
ah medium lah all the medium then no no jahans then um we caught one stingray ah small lah kecil ah uh then
I think we caught like what countless number of crabs lah we caught like twenty then the thing about the crab right we never bring apa yang kau campak tu ah we don't have bento and we don't have apa yang people usually throw
ah jaring I think it's called jaring ah net lah ah jala ah
tangkap pe
changi changi village we reach there pukul five plus six plus then masih lah we go buy chendol rilek pre-COVID last last year last year
then my friend ya si hanas hanas ah so he was like eh err I forgot what's the place ah but it's behind the that place lah that one that I told you just now ah pulau ketam belakang tu
tak lah he ah to the jetty the ah
taxi ya the taxi the best part is my friend already ask eh nak beli bento tak
then ah tak apa ah malas sangat bawa
then in the end we go there then because we got no bento no jala no what so in the end we use rod stand
rod stand the metal rod stand then we we just asar the tip make sure it's slightly sharper lah we go inside the water
we see we see we see one crab we whack so all the crabs right the twenty plus ah all got one lubang
all at least got one lubang one
think ketam bunga ah
wan one wan one dah tidur juga ah no you wan five I think then wan one wan okay wan one
he thirty plus wan tu baru kahwin wan three drive lorry eh err van van sorry wan four I never seen before
ah this wan one sleep han dah sleep then hakim tengah masak
err the behind the crab island lah ah pulau ubin he was there at pulau ubin then after that so I I told err hakim eh err nak nak tukar tu ah umpan because he's
then I ask him eh you don't want to open your rod campak umpan then he was like nanti ah tengok then I was like okay lah tak apa ah I go I go change my umpan
the the rest of them was doing their umpan on the left side so I went to their right side
then ambil ah udang hidup pegang lah benda tu goyang-goyang then tengah tengah dah dah dah
dah poke ah dah poke the udang
then dah campak dah campak dah rilek ah then I was like ya tengok it was it's a nice scenery lah then then I realised I I heard something on the right side then I was like itu apa tu then I I listen closely lah
then it was actually azan ah ah three
three azan I don't know azan buat lah terkejut I also don't know lah
ya three ah azan then I was like azan eh then because I look to the I look inside I look inside the forest then it was pitch dark
then I was like the only the only way this can be like real ah if there is a kampung beside lah
so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask nos eh nos beside yang tempat we pancing got kampung ah then tak ada lah then I was like
oh tak ada ah pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan
I heard ada macam ada orang tengah azan and I I stood there for quite some time lah just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly lah eh kau tak bilang ah
oh kau tak kejut aku then I was like apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ
so he was like um tertidur
then he tried to sleep you know ah he always try to sleep when he pancing one then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then dia pusing pusing pusing then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree lah kat tengah-tengah in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree lah then he saw one nenek one nenek
walk pass then he was like ah the nenek told him like cu cu dah tahu sini tempat keras kan asal malap jer di tempat you eh macam tempat you pula eh no no no not that
why why um malap jer tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight lah but that day he just never on it lah then
apa tu err macam this one is mystics lah like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
keep quiet then rilek-rilek then the nenek um turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that lah
then the driver say got one time he was passing by ah at night ah then he actually saw at the pokok there ada err pocong ah tengah
so it it means that like that nenek come to actually warn them that that place very malap then got other stuff also lah then that that nenek just go there to warn them lah like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice lah but it's just malam ya malam kena jaga-jaga ya
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this one is where the driver will drive eh drive then this is an open area di sini ada satu pokok in the middle
path ah actually the right path also can you will see pulut ketam in front of you that stretch like that ah towards the tip lah you can see the whole tip of pulau ketam
then your past few days macam mana your past few months ah ah the time the last
time I met you then you say you just berhenti kerja pe you just stop work
so apa you you apply mostly what type of apa industry
what phone call eh kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau english all the way eh have you never notice beginning
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the cerita so kau dah apply kerja habis semua tak dapat ah all all rejected you
sakit hati ah
surrounding have a few other masjid in the east
no lah I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background juga kan
you will need to come in and explain to them oh tak lah this the way the reason why I letak the moderator first then followed by the asatizah then followed by err fandi ahmad is because
um according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever uh I know that first kau kena letak the moderator first
why why why the moderator first pasal dia yang akan moderate everything then followed by the asatizah who are
no lah to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of macam situasi lah
ya that's why lah that's not like you said lah is tak professional lah
of course is the comic lah because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group akan dibawa naikkan to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that dalam kamu punya age group lah so it's better for you in that sense ah
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera dah berapa mahal then err the time you took to edit I actually
pernah I pernah help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge ah tentang video ah the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship lah then after that then apa tu the thing is
kenapa tak ada any background in Photoshop ke apa ke so nak edit tak tahu macam mana nak edit so I ask you for help that time
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was tak susah because tak banyak animation tak banyak at that time lah it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence itu pun dah boleh jadi gila
then ya I understand because as a programmer nanti I do some programs ke apa and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti eh hakim um actually the client tak suka uh this part of the game ah can change it then dalam hati aku macam what it took me hours to get that part working
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research tengok whether apa tu apa yang client tu nak is feasible tak can it be included
into the program itself macam the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so oh sakit
true story actually sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap
no lah is is just pelik lah
dah start merepek
you know the back to the story sikit right just now I talk about my intern so my intern kan I was being paid err one thousand dollars
eh rilek ah rilek ah dengar dulu but but the thing is the time err I'm from
so bila kita um want to sign up for apa tu for internship you need to go through this website ah I forgot what's the website oh my apa website dia ah
ada lah website tu ada ada lah masih situ ah
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to gaji so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over ah fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through gaji like which one is higher pay lah
then I went in then I went in rilek-rilek talk with my colleagues then got other interns juga situ they are leaving already
then I was like eh your gaji berapa ah how much kau dapat every month one thousand huh eh one thousand sikitnya
wah sikitnya one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like oh according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know lah but
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like apa hal ni
malas you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay ah once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay lah rezeki di mana-mana
no you will say can boleh macam mana oh you need to sign up this you need to do that ah tak apa
Grab lah last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see macam dia punya timeline ah like what do you
kau cakap kau nak kerja Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo oh betul eh jauh
if you if you hustle even more macam hustle demi hustle jer is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
if you really can't get anything because apa tu okay lah I got learn some finance also lah kan you should know lah so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in lah rather than just duit terkeluar duit terkeluar then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the rezeki belum masuk lagi in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering dulu lah then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
take off like okay ah pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat ah I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
from your house sini jalan kaki punggol sengkang further eh macritchie further
mana seh
kenapa tu kenapa ada kick tu how long
dulu twenty four click take so long
macam might as well lah I park my motor somewhere
ah cerita cerita apa ah yang the worst witch
it's about this uh kid lah abeh dia ada power but then dia dia macam harry potter tapi it's about females it's witches
quite fun lah to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja kan so I just watch like whatever I can find lah on netflix then that popped out so I watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
tapi dia orang pun baru pe so that kind of standard pe
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa ah dia orang naik harga kan
banyak benda sia naik harga my google drive also naik harga
I haven't seen any updates on it but I know google dah ada
assignment apa sia
I mean it will get better lah I mean yang COVID ni semua bukan like forever what they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu ah
tengok ah
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa sia
but ada juga ah macam sikit
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
mm masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
banyak sangat benda kan
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
I think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli pe it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
habis smite apa jadi
oh really cause I know that day uh siapa naim asked uh ilyas to join but then ilyas said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
mm four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for ilyas so like dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why ah ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like oh I cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us jer
I think baru ah like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his ya
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue lah he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
probably go with good looks but I mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun I mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru I mean you can't really do that also what so probably good looks
ya I guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
I mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit ah
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff lah kalau tak then there's really like no point
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
kalau ni hari not much lah I'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe I shall do that
rasa macam free kan
sekarang muka macam maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu lah tak nak panjang sangat pun
kalau kat rumah hmm
netflix lepas tu
main and playing a bit of
apa lagi ah
uh no I haven't played cause like I don't know macam
main dengan naim and muhammad they very competitive and then like if ilyas is not there like can't really
so I usually kalau dia orang dua jer then I I avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main ah cause I
I mean the same thing happened bila that time I tried to download kat my macbook apa
cause I don't think they have a punya file
oh ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah ah
I mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
uh pergi ah
so what the cow is the hantu or like
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
the latest the one I think just got removed what the kampung
I don't know buangkok some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
uh orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time I went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu ah
ya went there and then dia orang cakap uh tempat tu memang ada benda ah like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik ah like this chinese auntie
abeh dia orang cakap macam um like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur lah just let it be
we film from I think like we arrived there at six ah so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
and then we had to delay and then wait then um when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change ah cause
dia ah she's like I think some
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun lah but macam
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
we were kind of worried lah that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god lah like nasib ah
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary ah to see her in the dark
ya lah but then it's the only kampung I know that exists in singapore lah
that kampung
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam uh tiga caucasian people ang moh like white people
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok ah then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam oh what you're doing
they like oh okay cool cool and jalan
quite a few like um there's a lot of kampung houses lah but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang jer tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang ah
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff ah and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
besar juga ah like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
it's all kayu and then like very old school lah semua macam
stay in the kampung
ya it's quite gelap I mean there there is a few street lights ah like around the area but it's quite dark and then um
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment kan so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and I'm like um no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing one
dia hantu baik then I'm like okay
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
tiga tahun eh it's quite recent sia
but like kesian juga ah like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
I want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay ah
pergi satu kali ah when in maybe secondary school
tiga wish
oo okay lah kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil jer lah kalau kalau bayar then okay ah aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat dekat rumah aku okay lah and
I mean ya memang ah like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like oh you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
but I don't think macam
kat bawah block
huh sini takde banyak kucing
only got lembu
have you seen your cat luar
seram sia
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad lah macam
hmm bila like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak sia it's like cannot breathe and stuff
sekarang if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy ah like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when I mandi him like
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to macam pursue technology
the president speaks in malay kau orang semua stop it eh
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi I just I just want to give you a warning eh kau stop jer eh jangan buat lagi tau

err eh is it ah ah ke dalam pukul dua gitu gitu check-in
eh tak lah wah we play mm wah that was the first time my layang-layang flied so high eh it was like wow
think we checked-in then we what did we have ah I cannot remember apa kita makan kat sana I think oh you know before that right kita pergi Arab Street makan dekat this place near Masjid Sultan
I think it's called err ape minang kah ape I can't remember the name
like um the minang err the cuisine name
no eh it was cheap like it was considered macam atas street food
but wah the food was so good until now I'm thinking about dia punya tahu telur wah sedap oof
yeah then we wah we nasib baik ah kita dapat err swimming slot for both for all three days
oh tu tak tau but I know they have like satu jam punya slot habis tu thirty minutes for cleaning
oh no no like we boleh masuk untuk satu jam habis tu before the next slot they will clean for thirty minutes then there is a next slot
yeah we lucky lah cause some people tak dapat so yeah
err oh the last day kita pergi right we went at err I think lapan setengah pagi habis tu hujan
tak ah mandi aja lah
sejuk ah
no err hari kedua we went to ape tu Garden By The Bay
yeah masuk dalam
okay lah I will lagi
tak eh cause they limit the occupancy
and I'm like wah tak banyak orang
uh tu pun pergi boring seh pergi banyak kali
err cause is like if not for this situation kita pun tak pergi nya cause mahal seh on normal days
I think around there kat sana tu
wanted to have like graduation staycay also tak dapat seh
uh tak dapat reply nak buat ape
wah actually dia punya shift panjang seh
belum the result only coming out err bulan depan there yeah
yeah my siblings say I'm a bum a home bum so I'm like okay tu pun jadi lah
yeah I mean some of the requirements also I don't meet lah macam what ada kan diploma lah atau experience lah then I'm like I don't have any
uh I'm like it require three months aku tiga bulan dah start sekolah ape kalau gitu
eh I play with me I will download it and then boleh main sama-sama
I don't I I err boleh boleh tanya orang lain
oh err ada lah or
ya because they tengok a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try nak cuba
oh my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press dia punya butang after that he hide the body behind him
mm betul wah I miss playing night games with people
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO atau Among Us then I'm like
err all meat but I can still eat daging lembu yes
yeah because daging lembu selalu macam they have this smell
yeah yeah and then tak boleh tahan it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
I mean tak boleh predict pe so
yeah especially since err nanti the fish will macam bau ja hanyir so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
nak but then
bila nak pergi what's the plan
twenty eight agak near lah kena check again
okay yeah my poly friends also dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke they all already start uni
tak sekolah lain-lain seh
entah lah dia orang nak jumpa makan lah nak jumpa belajar then I'm like kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama
yeah then macam guys move on
that's why then I macam aiya whatever lah it's up to them then next week ah minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa then they were like oh kita tunggu untuk Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then eh I just open the chat habis tu I kan I just say mm err you guys go ahead I'm not free
then the makanan they all want to eat also selalu dia orang nak minta makanan I tak boleh makan
yeah cause dengan our secondary school friends kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu pe selalu it's very easy for us to settle food what
yeah then is don't know lah is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like oh let's eat Umisushi then okay aku tak boleh makan
yeah it's like oh let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet dengan dia orang it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like penat seh why did I go out I regret going out of the house
boleh experiment then you see mana satu lagi murah
uh yeah aigoo dah lah tak ada kerja habis tu bus fare pun mahal hais
oh I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey dia punya yeah
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems lah like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible punya bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
cause even for like macam orang yang tak boleh nampak like visual disability they have new apps macam the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
cause even for my school cause Ngee An kan ada that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability pun I there was this period of time I had like macam class right then every time if I reach school dekat this certain timing I will see that makcik that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
oh forest no tak dengar eh
wah was the forest fire macam bad
oh my gosh why apa gunanya gender reveal seriously
it's macam
pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
I guess maybe we have different values like untuk kita if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
wah ah speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she mm baked untuk your birthday wah I still think of it sometimes
yeah cause I mean I think the cake macam dry because dah simpan satu hari pe dah potong then you give it to them the next day but wah the whipped cream I was so amazed cause selalu whipped cream kan diorang buat cake is either macam banyak sangat then too sweet or like the whipping cream macam how to say ya macam berminyak is that the word like
yeah don't cause you messaged me habis tu you messaged dengan orang lain kan and we were like err dia tak kan beli cake kan like err err err
that's why when you asked me kalau nak cake then I like I like cake but kalau aku bilang aku nak cake nanti kau beli macam mana
no she panic cause yang when you were working together yang ada satu hari ni then after that kita send message then you pakai dia punya handphone kan then dia eh guys Nisha pakai aku punya handphone then we were like oh did she see the chat
yeah then we ni we panic right then kita tukar dia punya group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
yeah eh I can pinjam you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one kena bayar
it's it's super hilarious macam you you boleh nampak their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
err sekarang dah ada empat if you want to include macam behind the scenes ada lapan in total
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the cawan was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got cawan I was like
is is like your cup nya design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
right it's ugh and it's not very like macam merchandise is you
wah you know the only time yang diorang letak diorang punya muka right the I think is the merchandise I was like nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas
mm I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in punya bantal</malay lah dia punya soft toy then I like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the chibi the tiny Tan oh my god oh I wanted to get their things and then after that aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya shipping fee then I'm like
dia punya shipping macam boleh beli tiga dia punya product tau I was like ugh
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right dia punya shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
oh no no no that one change already cause that one is diorang punya old style
you want to level up untuk dapat lebih banyak benda you must do the quiz and fill up the test
tak dia this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
tapi bodoh lah just tak you spend like ape thirty dollars just to kacau orang on the website
well nak beli this macam sweater it's a knitted sweater lah then I also looking at this skirt
yeah err I think the skirt dalam dua belas dollar gitu
tak it's just I want to save up the money first
because the shipping is only macam dalam dua tiga dollar gitu aje not much
yeah cause macam it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse punya factory lah so yeah
dah boleh off
okay ah jadi in january
I aku tanya untuk early check in
aku kena jumpa kau pukul tiga kat bugis
mail confirmed datang ke tak
kita jumpa dia orang somewhere
then bila kita dah jumpa dia orang then baru kita macam
cari tempat makan ah I mean
I don't know aku tak tahu macam kau orang nak buat whether kau orang nak order from app sendiri sendiri atau kau orang nak beli then bring back
betul juga ah
boleh ah
tapi tu lah aku pun macam
untuk confirm
err actually semua belum confirm
it's err dayah actually dah confirm tapi pasal anak dia
kalau pasal anak dia jadi dia macam to be confirmed
kita macam so far so good lah kan
for dayah confirmed pasal man fetch dia then man datang ambil hantar
kira K the thing is dayah man akan ambil anak-anak dayah then ambil dia then hantar dia supposedly that was what I had in my head but dia cakap
oh anak aku pun datang abeh dia cakap aku tak biasa orang lain jaga anak aku so aku macam
macam you know that feeling ah macam
boleh lah tapi also mai mai pun pasal dia
tak sekolah apa I mean dia kerja kat sekolah
but part time but then at the same time pasal on the four baru buka we are going on the eight
ah eight nine apa we go on the eight so aku tak tahu macam mana how she will juggle it
like kerja
dengan kita ah but
I know that all of them nak join definitely like siapa yang tak nak budak primary school
problem tak I mean also at the same time beacause I did personally ask them
whether okay ke tak
macam abeh dia orang semua macam excited okay
then the anak thing
the anak thing came up then after everything is like
okay semua orang macam
tengok lah macam mana
I mean aku don't mind I I mean really
betul betul eh aku really don't mind tau kalau dia bawa anak dia
but it's attitude anak dia yang buat aku macam
tu yang buat aku marah gila tau bila the first time aku nampak that kind of attitude and she even say um dah dah ada rumah dah pindah semua perangai tak nak dengar kata aku
dia macam cakap out loud tau macam you know how mothers are like ah aku seorang kat rumah ni
ah aku seorang jer kemas orang lain ah macam gitu dia macam rant
why suddenly the change then dia macam aku pun tak tahu ah semua orang macam perangai
you know you are expecting guests you you already have guests yesterday abeh ini hari aku dengan cousin man datang
to your child and ask macam
kau okay tak
why are you behaving like this abeh macam dia
aku tak tahu ah like really aku aku tak nak malukan dia
aku tak nak dia kita malukan dia like
so aku macam you know
as fake as it is ah aku macam nak try everything to go smoothly tau aku tak nak nanti macam
I mean this will happen ah orang macam
why I come here oi kau eh kau duduk eh alamak standard mothers I I expect that even wati is like
aku tak tahu whether aku bawa anak aku pasal nanti aku tarzan and anak dia perempuan
kau tak tutup pintu eh tadi
okay I take the fault so mojo boleh keluar tak
takde dia nak tengok muka aku juga macam gitu gasak lah kau
okay but apa
so I was thinking aku fikir kan nak macam if we're getting together aku nak order mango tart
dari kawan aku lah but she say she can for weekday she can only do delivery seven thirty onwards
then aku macam okay ah I don't mind
then but at the same time bugis banyak dessert though
dia banyak dessert
so aku macam is it worth it ordering from my friend
err siapa
dia kahwin dia kahwin dah pregnant dah ada anak then she was like posting about anak dia then after that stopped
like anak dia
kan macam out of the blue stopped so aku pun macam oh okay lah
sebab tu lah
dia okay ke tak
that's that's why bila aku tanya dia kan aku macam mm should I ask should I ask
pasal aku tak tahu whether
she is into getting together with us meeting up with us ke tak
aku nak tutup aku tutup pintu jap just in case mister mojo masuk
eh busy kau
kau dah bilang dia lah
oh nanti lah aku tengok aku check kan kalau ada lagi ni pun aku nampak kat facebook lah sia
aku nampak tapi aku macam okay I sent in my interest then dia get back to aku then dia cakap but actually boleh send anytime
actually boleh send anytime
then aku macam tengok lah macam mana pasal err dia cakap slots are filling up fast
so aku cakap dengan dia aku boleh buat on friday which is dengan kau lah there is no way I'm doing with someone else
cause abeh dia cakap pun dia boleh dapatkan orang
tak nak aku I'm not I'm not in school to do that
aku pun aku zoom sekali jer
sekali jer
kau insurance apa ah
ada rider
no ride rider means it's an extra premium jadi kau boleh dapat macam
um that is a um macam
macam mana eh nak cakap kau boleh
kira kan
private hospital macam hospital aku
ya but it's still macam subject to approval ah
but insurance kau kau dapat bila
so shouldn't be a but it's not a pre existing condition apa
two thousand fourteen kira lepas kau kahwin baru ada insurance
oh before asal kau tak ambil rider sekali
recently aku check untuk siapa si
ah dia ada rider anak dia ada rider just anak bongsu dia takde
but maybe it might be some aku can check lah what is your
ya I know it's shield something aku tak ingat ah nama dia
the words juga
kan macam ah is healthshield gold max A then there is also gold max B
ah A paling tinggi B macam down ah
kalau kau boleh check
I mean you can always ask lah bcause sometimes a lot of banyak orang kan kat kerja aku bila aku buat dia orang punya how to say ah
banyak anak seh tak tahu mak bapa dia orang punya insurance apa
macam ah I'll ask your parents got insurance
oh I don't know I don't know semua kau tak tahu apa yang kau tahu
macam these kind of things especially mak bapa kau dah tua
then aku macam
apa yang kau bayar untuk insurance macam kalau let's say ah the basic ah is medishield then kalau kau upgrade and then it will be depend on which company you take ah your prushield
then kalau tak upgrade baru kau tahu but then bila kau upgrade poly kau nak kena tahu whether kau punya is
atas atau somewhere in between macam parents aku punya is just one step below which is B plus is the
rider plan A plus is like not basic ah but it's there so macam
like dia orang kalau pergi private eh so kira macam emergency dia orang kena pergi private they have to pay upfront first
then reimbursement ah so that's why aku selalu cakap dengan members members eh
kau orang muda kau orang boleh afford it why not
memang betul lah kau macam kau tengok macam payah kau nak bayar
yearly kau bayar berapa when you count
macam kau even it out for twelve months
it's sikit seh it's like forty dollars fifty dollars unless you pay like over thousand over dollars ah then
TAQWA apa seh
itu apa islamic punya apa
tapi kan
asal hospital aku takde
pasal I mean
prudential aviva so ni empat jer tau most probably kalau ah qing were to come right she will have to pay first then reimburse
ya so that's how it is lah macam dia dapat refund balik ah kalau
kita boleh try to get electronic letter of guarantee which mean that without deposit so means kau tak payah bayar upfront
ah ah because that's why unless you don't I mean that's why I asked you whether kau private ke
private atau government for your future baby
oh okay lah government you don't have to worry macam kawan aku zahirah
three K dia keluar cash money
aku rasa they have a very big subsidiary for future mums
ah because they menggalakkan untuk kau mengadakan baby dan breastfeed
ya they they are really big on that seh they will get dia sampai dapat apa tu nursing
like if the baby doesn't latch on then dia cakap okay you try this you try that
but tapi bayar lah
oh that time kakak ipar aku punya tak seh
eva tak seh
tak tau pasal dia nak compete dengan private banyak orang pergi private because of that but at the same time people go to private because it's much more efficient much more faster
because of lesser clientele macam zahirah punya kakak ipar
she was like oh aku tak datang period
that time dia pergi hospital dia macam okay this is my err
macam oh I already have two kids I should be okay pergi then dia cakap oh you have a mass
macam a cyst a cyst a tumour or whatever need to remove so dia macam hati tak sedap dia pergi doctor aziz
dia orang ultrasound ah that's why tu pasal dia macam okay whatever I just spend a bit more money just for private
and anak dia semua doctor aziz
this doctor aziz apparently ada berapa sebelas anak
that's what I heard dari makcik aku pasal makcik aku ni ah pun doctor aziz juga

tu pasal but dia orang cakap anak dia paling kecil is quite young
I don't know maybe dia masih nak kena tanggung for sekolah
oh pasal oh pasal kau

but aku macam aku pun nak tengok gynae actually aku I I only have one month left sia for me to check for pap smear under my
uh kerjanya insurance
but aku nak kena pergi A&E nak kena dia orang check then after that you need to give some
bedek bedek then in order for you to see a gynae then after that tell them to give me pap smear
ah terus aku macam huh because if kalau aku pergi straight aku kena bayar out of pocket aku tak boleh pakai kerja punya insurance so aku macam mm

ah aku tak faham asal orang macam gini like there's some people who really like macam so obsessed over
anak dia to a point that dia sanggup buat macam gini kau faham tak budak tu pun kena culik
aku tak pernah tengok sia tu
and it's lepas tu second rider pergi kat sana balik dah orang lain kan
tapi kan bila dia cakap macam gitu ada darah semua teringat aku pasal steven lim
ah adrian lim kesian seh
tak ah
tapi bila aku baca aku macam confused
pasal dia ambil budak tu dari clementi seh
aku tak tahu budak tu tinggal mana tapi dia pergi clementi untuk dengan makcik dia macam main-main kat bawah block
then entah entah dia kena bunuh kat toa payoh jauh tu
tapi yang ada lagi satu victim tu yang dia dapat lari eh oh tak it's a budak melayu tu kan yang dapat lari eh
ni aku sikit hari apa ah few years back ah abang aku tanya aku
ah googlekan adrian lim terus macam
kau ada smartphone apa
tapi internet dulu kan berapa ah
so aku macam oh okay I google for you abeh dia cakap block apa ah block ni ni ni aku tak ingat aku tak ingat block apa ah terus aku macam
why you want to know no why you find hantu ah
then macam tak ah okay lor okay lor
but nowadays macam banyak cerita hantu hantu
but tu dia sacrifice ah
tapi kau tengok ah muka dia macam babi sia
tapi kau dah tengok kau dah baca a son of peach punya yang
aku that time aku baca then tak tahu macam mana mona fandey boleh masuk
mona fandey punya stories pun boleh masuk juga terus aku macam
dia orang cakap mona fandey ni apa uh
err oh lately dia punya kawan perempuan err did something for drugs ah dekat malaysia abeh dia kena gantung tapi sebelum dia kena gantung dia duduk dekat mona fandey punya cell lama
every night dia kena kacau
abeh ada orang macam come to defense ah cakap oh dia macam dia kena fitnah seh
dia kena fitnah pasal dia sembahyang lima waktu then son of peach cakap kau fikir kau jaga barang ni semua tak senang ke of course kau nak kena sembahyang lima waktu seh kalau tak benda ni makan kau
ah so that's why you want like keep your iman
strong at the same time you want to practise all these terus aku macam
ah jadi dia
tak macam selama ni dia tahu macam black magic ni kau pun nak kena sembahyang lima waktu jadi benda-benda ni semua tak kacau kau
tapi at the same time kan aku tak rasa dia ada black magic
that ilmu kebal
aku tak tahu lah macam dia punya intention to just pakai duit sidek ni
pakai duit yang siapa ni yang mati ni then bila dia bunuh then dia just pakai jer pasal she had no intention of covering it up apa
so aku rasa macam maybe the intention is just to buat pakai duit ni bunuh
then on the disguise of ada ilmu kebal
mm but at the same time dia ada practice dia macam small time small time jer lah tapi
macam orang yang kat quaters dekat
malaysia punya
aku macam oh my god oh my god
abeh bila aku kerja kat kan aku punya colleague cakap apa tau eh kau tahu mona fandey oh tahu tahu asal asal kau nampak dia aku nampak satu makcik ni macam dia pakai kebaya semua
ah kau tahu bila dia pergi court kan dia pakai kebaya dia cakap ah makcik ni macam dia dekat harbourfront terus aku cakap mona fandey dah sampai singapore
apa ni mona fandey sampai singapore
imagine sekali satu hari kau pass by kau nampak mona fandey
oh atau orang macam mona fandey aku pekik lah sial
tu lah tapi
kan ah dia orang cakap yang kat quarters ni dia orang cakap ah dia macam selalu asal cepat sangat asal cepat sangat macam from three to six dia orang akan nampak
pasal dia nak kena gantung lepas subuh apa so dia macam alamak asal cepat sangat ni dia cakap jangan cepat sangat lah tu macam ee seramnya aku
tapi siapa yang duduk cell dia akan kena gantung
ah pasal aku rasa cell dia it's just for those yang akan kena gantung nanti aku macam mm and recently kakak ipar aku pun macam dia kakak ipar aku sekolah kan
so dia tanya
sometimes people who banyak orang kena gantung
macam pasal singapore punya amount for hanging is quite high
eh it's quite low kalau macam kau five gram jer kau dah boleh kena gantung padahal tu five gram is cukup untuk kau pakai sendiri then aku macam
banyak melayu kena gantung seh yang kena gantung melayu
mostly malays yang si cina ni semua dapat
so aku macam it's it's already like lah where
apa heavy
tapi kakak kakak ipar aku pun berbual pasal dia kerja kat dalam kan dia pun ada cakap kau tengok ah yang si cina-cina ni semua blue collar sia eh cina-cina semua white collar crime crimes sia and duit dia orang banyak-banyak kau orang punya duit sikit-sikit duduk berapa lama
kakak ipar aku cakap think of it ah look at it
and also dia pun tak tahu ah macam how she feels about the death penalty I mean kalau betul-betul pada aku macam orang yang patut kena bunuh is rapist kena hang ni yang rapists child molesters they should be hanged but apparently dia orang kena serve time then after that they come out mana boleh
pada aku rotan tak cukup sia bro
ah rotan dua empat kali pun tak cukup
atau jadikan subject of experiments
but there's human rights lah so aku macam whatever lah this people are not humans
entah because I think dulu kan dia orang fikir macam the drugs can ruin our children our future
that was their thinking lah so aku macam
ni semua sia dia orang patut they should actually look into it seh
drugs but I'm like pada aku macam
kau sedar macam it's like
a human life memang betul lah both of them play with human lives but then
kau kentut eh
these rape victims may not be macam
they are alive ah but dia traumatised for life
and badan dia orang rabak seh
and badan dia orang may change macam rabak like what if they get pregnant from the rapists like eh jangan bodoh ah
ah boleh makan dalam ah mm
but aku tak tahu dia orang ni semua macam mana
then aku macam
about the human life who have ruined another human like a lot of these drug not drug traffickers I'm not saying about drug traffickers lah banyak dia orang makan sendiri like they use it for their own consumption they are not selling
but kalau kau tengok dia punya amount is not macam lima
aku ada ah ni satu case kat yishun yang pakcik ya uncle lah
ya takde pun hanging
ah tak
entah lah dok
ni semua politic politic ni politic
and also they live up to the stereotype juga lah
macam kat geylang that time aku yana aku tengok asal dia ni macam weird aku dah mata dah tak nampak sangat tangan ada gam
tangan ada gam meleleh-leleh bodoh betul
semua orang sia aku tak tahu bila abang aku masuk pun kita semua macam kita adik-beradik macam tahu lah
but that one point of time bila dia gaduh dengan fizah tu part yang dia kena angkat terus
whatever tu pasal aku cakap maybe right maybe he's a drug user that's why you cannot
aku tak tahu seh pasal
aku cakap dengan dia takpe takpe it's okay
kau tengok eh semua macam couple couple abang aku ada dua anak tiri abang second aku ada dua anak sendiri aku ada dua anak kucing
I aku single parent
eh mak macam mak bila nak clear ni orang nak berak ni
my uncle selalu cakap dia orang macam kalau full kan nanti dia orang tak tahu mana nak
then that time kau tahu dia orang kan dah boleh sauk benda tu sampai tahi pun terkeluar
eh musibut
tu aku cakap okay lah sayang sorry sekarang aku dah tukar dia orang punya litter
pasir it's pee
it's made from snow pea dia ringan
kecil aku tak tahu ah macam mana it's like very ringan ah
and dia punya pea patch dia tak besar macam
ah pasal bila kencing dia kan dia spread jadi dia besar
ah macam kat situ cakap oh pee dia kecil
sebab aku tak tahu lah pasal pasir rabak ah aku nak kena bersihkan
then at the same time dia macam bersepah sangat
because it's very light macam kau orang tendang satu kali tendang banyak
so that time nasib aku punya ah apa vacuum bagus so aku just
aku vacuum terus aku macam
then kadang-kadang dia orang jangan nak anuh lebih-lebih eh
oh dia orang dia orang dapat snack every other day dia orang dah kurang
kadang aku ella aku masuk dapur dia masuk dapur

entah dia macam tengok aku aku just buat bodoh
terus dia macam dia macam tengok-tengok aku terus aku macam abeh kawan dia cakap ah asal asal abeh aku pergi hisap rokok then member

tapi a'ah seh aku jumpa dia macam aww dia still putih tinggi the same shit he looks better now
he's six years older than me terus aku dia macam oh you want to exchange no
aku tak nak contact dengan dia
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
like that thing anak luar nikah jer
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen pasal ada anak
wow there's a lot of way way sia macam
okay dalam segi agama I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing lah like just to settle down like err apa to prevent like any sins or any like um what does it call
no no mm haram and thing and like macam um uh what is it macam the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
so macam apa ya
honestly no ah because like nanti macam ingat kau macam main main
like you think what this one main main is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back merepek what
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like ah I've heard lah stories macam aku nampak yang they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya islam
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia ah malaysia ku entah leh maybe it's normal maybe is not lah but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like err what is restu
ah ah they give restu ah they give I the blessing ah dorang kasih blessing dorang
then it's like wow like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage ah for parents nak kasih restu like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind lah kan
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like tak sabar
they just want to like so macam like oh
if I get married oh you know everything will be like halal you know macam ni ni ni ni like actually ah he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like macam
so if later macam if it's just reflects to the people and there's like oh kau tengah stereotype just because I'm young
for me ah okay ah kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu ah because like I think I I really believe yang macam apa ya love does not apa ya time does not define love ke love does not define time ada kat that thing ah
like kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one ah because like I heard stories like my apa apanya cikgu
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school sampai ke tua like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around
like macam he he wasn't serious he still don't want to get married
no no not not the other chicks lah like macam he's just not ready for marriage dia tak dia tak belum fikir kan lah okay for my cikgu kan she's like okay let's say lepak ah ya
okay the guy likes to lepak jam beberapa jam ke dua tiga pagi tau just lepak bawa blok berbual-bual rokok tu semua right my teacher is like by eleven is like eh aku tak penat jah like I want to go home I want to sleep like so like that ya so macam they they I think it's like eight years' relationship
ya ya they call it off they dia orang tak tunang pun ya they broke up she broke up with him and then after that err kak got to know
find new people think she dated one I think like less than a year and I saw she tunang and then after that a year after that she got married ya ya
ya that's the thing like actually I was shocked that she she like she was okay lah maybe dia ada rasa sedih lah I mean siapa tak rasa sedih kan kalau break up
but she's like you know what this is not what I want like like she knows what she wants tu aku yang jawab aku respect kau ah
you really follow me ah eh kalau ikutkan hati aku
I mean like I've been single for the longest time for so macam like
you know you just gonna get any guy then kalau like kau okay aku okay kita go ah sia
but then it's like okay let's say kau
kau dengan my dear kau berapa lama
boleh but then you think your parents will agree
oh tak boleh sambung uh huh
ya I think I've heard stories like they they they just like marry by paper but they still macam go on lah macam I think they are like schooling or something macam let's say kes kalau ni ah
from there ah then masuk like okay lah slowly perlahan perlahan kayuh ah
society nya sekarang now is like I think apa ever since okay let's say our generation ah eh like okay let's say my after our parents' generation like maybe the like early nineties or like the late eighties all of them run dusted the career minded path semua yang tak nak kahwin pun
mm like angkat kaki hurry I already late for work
and then lepas tu macam like complain bila jam
eh amboi
oh I thought like actually yang aku akan like will go itu I thought like people would really go to because like we like

but normal girls because she he kidnapped three girls K one of it pure than the other two mereka macam popular kind then is like oh kau tak pure
kau macam tak kisah gitu pasal orang something like that ah
but when they showed the scars of the girl who's like oh you're pure because in a way is like dia tahu rasa sakit kau tak tahu rasa sakit that's why aku rasa dia pure daripada kau
and then she jeling at me

me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no what

I nak
cause a snowball effect to tau tu pasal I
dapat degree
pasal I see all my friends
kawan-kawan kan
semua dah habis degree tau
you nak tahu tahu you tahu tak
I malam-malam kan
kadang-kadang I fikir tau

kalau I
didn't do anything I tunggukan boyfriend jer
I betul-betul harap
dorang accept I
pasal kan
I know it's gonna be tough tapi
I kena cuba
like if not now bila
I perlukan pertolongan lah in that area
marketing is on demand tu pasal lah susah nak cari kerja
tu lah kerja I dulu
betul you know like
pasal kita nak experiences kan they think they don't really take us
tapi actually I think yang if it is a very good
pasal if
tapi did you know that I mention
like I kata tadi like
even intern job dorang minta experiences
that is the funny part to me lah pasal dorang nak experiences tapi
they ask so you boleh imagine tak like
tapi you gotta
you gotta work hard for it lah macam
that's a very good question actually tapi kan talking about movies
you want a genre yang you suka tak
I suka
perlukan itu lah bantal
untuk cover muka
tak lah actually
I tengok
horror like not really horror it's like thriller tapi
you akan jumpa jodoh you juga trust me
so tak payah tak payah nak sedih-sedih semua
you ada Netflix tak

mine I would say ah alhamdulillah I'm I'm very grateful for the results cause I expected worse but I guess my lecturers were just being lenient ah
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we uh our exam punya duration would be like three hours right
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual ah question answer kind of thing ah cause ya ya cause it's like um I'm taking it uh for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's err what's the subject oh education secondary uh educational psychology nya subject so it's like
tu lah like err initially I was like
sorry sorry banyak kan aiya but
lima soalan jer lepastu saya harus jawab kan dalam masa empat puluh lapan jam ye puan-puan

bahasa melayu nusantara ya so ya I mean ya but you are taking level two right ya so ya so like she I mean it's good lah cause it's like monday until thursday

uh cerita dia like it's about um cerita dia it's about like um this person
eh aku selama ni err dekat dunia aku aku
buat jahat jer tapi kenapa like ya tapi kenapa like she's quite dia macam like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like um tapi kenapa aku dekat the good place like shouldn't be ya macam like tak ke patut ya lah tak ke patut aku dekat the bad place ya but then turns out that
it's a funny show ya it's comedy it's like eh dia nya genre is like comedy
cannot ah eh ya I mean at times it's very macam cringey uh and very like cliche the storyline
ya ya ya ya it's it's done that time dorang baru habis like I think it's around

um faham faham I can see I can see ah ya ya ya ya
and they don't mind tau like they just put their macam opinion on the twitter out there and macam
to me it's so brave and it takes a lot of courage to do that I just cannot macam like imagine the the what the critics ah I mean I think the critics are like macam I think I I I'm usually macam scared about like
the critics or like how people will judge me after that ah basically like oh you have this kind of thought macam you know kind of thing but then ya I mean it has uh huh
can can macam there's something that stopping you kan macam err okay to me usually I would say
to me I will usually say um ya sorry to me I usually macam what's stopping me at the same time is like my baseless assumptions ah atau macam baseless thought faham ke macam I didn't do a lot of reading but this is what I thought so I'm not sure like if I should like express it you get what I mean
ya ya ya ya oh my god oh my god faham faham faham faham macam like oh you you have this kind of like ya ya ya
ya but ya I also like respect them ah like um I mean like ah as to what you said just now about like I mean let's say if macam somebody or someone doesn't really agree with that that that opinion of theirs
like they are able to actually discuss about it faham ke
like to me I think if I were to put something kan then if another person would reply then I would be so cuak already like macam okay so what should I answer now macam wonder like
kan kan kan like I wouldn't deactivate cause of that ah basically macam like I wouldn't deactivate twitter just cause I I know that like through twitter you can get uh like updates ah like and they talk about like this sensitive I mean like especially I mean the millennials right you know right

tapi alhamdulillah

sini sini takda apa-apa eh
tapi susah lah I don't have that ah woman attraction ah aku susah nak dapat attention daripada perempuan I don't know why but
tapi kita punya uh syarikat ni kan ada satu yang ada satu macam punya perangai ah
macam mana eh
tapi macam mana kau bilang aku eh kita kat sini berapa orang jer manpower habis tu
sampai sekarang takde takde ah lagi satu placement untuk orang
abeh macam mana sia kerja
ah the apa tu works that they have done for the ah and then ah ya correct correct
boleh ah I think I think can get ah
korean ada eh
jepun punya orang ah
you can try ah tapi kalau
yang cement part where they want to pour
yang belakang tu belakang glass
the the the one ah beside the toilet kan ada glass panel kan
tapi it won't affect our glass ah katakan dia dia

banyak leceh ah I don't know ah how you want to handle her but
email pun takde ah
email pun takde ah
abeh main cakap jer nanti kita prepare lepas tu
panel kecoh
talking about this jimat apa cerita jimat bila nak
tubuh ada dengan siapa ah tu
aku baru lima puluh enam minit sia
macam mana tu kau handle aku pun sorry for you ah but
nanti appraisal dia kasih pun it's up to
bagus eh
ini tak boleh lah
down here ah the way they do appraisal macam mana tau okay appraisal time I give you the appraisal form you you go and grade yourself
actually I was kind of thinking of doing something macam similar
because I kind of miss macam
buat benda like I miss being like creative I guess
so like aku rasa like um
I follow a lot of macam Instagram shops actually and like
because like aku sekarang kirakan aku I don't have eh no no no sorry I have free time now
I mean I'm a bit I I was kind of used to dapat kerja but
yes dah so um I think
I think maybe I want to macam
I mean I I always see I selalu cakap nak
baju you know what I mean but then I I don't know ah I don't know where to start where do you start
I know that a lot of people have like macam
aku aku maybe rasa macam low-key aku boleh I can tell that some people
pandemic punya tu then like
and I mean I understand also lah cause aku pun sama juga
like at first aku pun sama juga but then like
aku macam low-key macam not not jealous but macam
I don't know how to explain the feeling ah I think I think aku macam
it makes me want to start my own not not that I want to start my own or what it's just macam
semua dia punya kedai semua macam sama-sama you know then like
obviously kita orang like feel like we can do better so
the thing is right yang yang kau cakap pasal the embroidery punya tote bag tu it's
honestly kan I nampak pernah nampak dekat TikTok
so like I I tend to scroll through and kadang-kadang I come across eh bukan apa uh the TikTok is like
macam shop punya lah then I saw this one I'm pretty sure it's a or or whatever it's a foreign punya
country punya shop then this girl basically
she does the same thing dia buat tote bag then she pakai sewing machine then the way that she realise
she can do the embroidery too it's because dia punya machine ada dia punya function abeh aku macam dalam kepala otak aku aku macam
isn't that like macam no offence
I understand it probably takes a time to macam like sit there and actually like betulkan settings and all it tapi macam
kalau it's like simple to and it's not her herself tengah embroidered right is the machine doing it
that orang singapore buat so macam kalau is macam simple gitu then like
one particular this uh apa ni account like jual
apa tu spectacle chain or whatever
maybe have baju custom fit for their own
kadang-kadang boleh pakai S kadang-kadang boleh pakai M depends lah uh most of the time S M gitu
then like you know how they have those uh sizes macam
kalau Cotton On they have um S M or like
how is it that this uh yang I tengah pakai ni like it's considered S M then I'm like does it fit every
you M but you on the verge of L like kau boleh sumbat ke ni
apa tu nama dia not really don't really have a lot of free ya loose so ya
to me and you I guess cause kita orang dua selalu baca kan so kita tahu like what's the difference
ada a few kedai kedai macam
online macam Loop Garms
there's also another one dekat jalan pisang yang Flame V that's that's one I always go to actually
because it's not that high sangat dia punya prices but ya like apa
and is actually this ah you tahu uh jericho
like he was really a fan of the nineties punya semua so
pernah pergi area itu then like macam a few times drop by already together
then I think dia selalu berbual dengan one of the owner I think isaac or whatever then um
I was like kenapa kau tak nak tanya jer jer lah but then he macam malu so I decided to do it
then apparently that shirt is a hundred dollars then aku macam
macam mana boleh hundred dollars ni macam expensive gila
maybe it's cause macam maybe it's imported from somewhere macam
then like they take into account like shipping fee and stuff like that tapi macam I don't know it's like
cause honestly it's not cause thrifting is macam
I mean the the concept is the same it's just that vintage kau betul-betul pay the price for the vintage ah thrifting
I mean in I think actually it is vintage if it's like lama gila and like
you can see that is macam been used before and stuff like that it is vintage in a sense but then vintage in my opinion is more like
because it can also be an investment what kalau
that shirt yang chris jericho punya shirt tu technically it can be an investment cause like
they maybe not don't really know of chris jericho ah cause dia kan lama-lama sikit kan
ah ya dia macam punya tu but like
ten twenty years down the road maybe even fifty years down the road maybe there will still be people who's still willing to macam
old like old outfits old trends and then they want to make it macam baru balik it's either they follow
is either they follow the old trends or they take the old trends and make it baru
kita orang just I don't know like how to I don't know how to explain pe seh but I guess like it's been berapa the fashion industry dah lama
ah dibina so like
like people dulu macam tak kesah but like at least now kita orang macam
lelaki tu meant well but then
kind of um macam mana nak cakap eh
macam misused it
right misuse and also macam ya lah just salah guna
I honestly I honestly think it's cause kita orang macam
just kita orang no longer live in that
so like once we use something we just nak buang
we we are actually talking about apa tu uh kedai right
you just cuba lah jual to to your like whoever who's ordered you ada berapa banyak order sekarang
oh tapi belum
orh yang uh yang backpack tu eh orh K
I think maybe you just try to sell to to the current orders sekarang ni yang you ada kan
you once you dah dibayar um
honestly kalau you nak kan promote is actually not that
you can actually macam
apa eh
but then if you buat macam specific ads or whatever right
it will normally show up macam kau bila kau tengok story orang kan it will pop up between stories gitu
it's not really macam
I think you got I think you pernah tag me under
like cause it's very macam it's not only unique but then like it's very macam ikut
demand gitu it's kind of cool
I would I would probably suggest uh macam
kau start with a few design abeh kau
macam kau post dulu then whichever is popular
like kau just keep note like take note in your head which one's popular then um kalau
kalau ada um
orang macam minta or whatever
like I guess you can just macam buat macam poll lah on your story whatever then you just ask like
uh kalau kau tak kau tak macam tanya customer kau like apa dorang nak and stuff like that it's hard to gauge and like what if
kau tak ada inspiration you know what I mean like what if tiba-tiba you
then obviously it will be susah what so I think it's important to have like
dia ada following so senang in my opinion no offence lah kalau kau ada the following kan
it's just easier for you to macam jual benda cause kau dah ada following banyak orang dia ada dua puluh K tau
dua puluh ribu sorry dua puluh K on her main account ya so like
I'm sure okay maybe not all of them will watch but maybe like ten K gitu akan tengok apa
ya maybe like half gitu at most I mean at least maybe ten K
dia tak ada lining eh kat dalam
ya some shops do that kat singapore pun ada cause actually I think I got follow
one I don't remember what's her name but dorang
pernah macam promote a few smaller businesses
then macam that's so cute cause like macam you know like support local ya exactly support local gitu
I kind of macam considered cause you know how I like I love to wear macam outerwear again
actually I considering macam belajar macam mana nak buat cause I love
I love outerwear macam gini I I don't know cause like I don't want to make it like so thick
but I love outerwear gini like I love I don't know why but I think I love the baggy look a lot
I stress out about the fact that I have free time abeh
bila aku dah stress out pasal free time until nanti aku cari kerja pula abeh abeh like I never use that free time wisely
actually um kau tahu kan uh I was considering uh apa tu
uh sambung belajar ya
because my parents are quite okay lah I'm very blessed because they quite supportive lah dorang macam
dorang okay kalau aku nak kerja ke nak belajar ke
dorang macam aku punya pasal nak buat apa but
still thinking about it and then one of the things aku realise
because uh aku dah I know aku baru kerja dua jobs but I I guess my parents pun realise macam
aku macam adaptable cause like
whenever aku kerja senang jer adapt to the situation cause it's just kerja what you know what I mean like it's not really
but ya so uh apa aku macam realise
a part of me macam
I realised that kalau kau tahu accounting
course kau tak pernah tu eh
is I don't know why I didn't do well but honestly is quite simple it's just macam
I don't know how to explain kau tahu macam
tak it's not that um
kau pernah dengar the term macam assets liability
all that right ya is basically is basically macam
how do I put this normally businesses ada accounting accountant
so basically uh accountant ni macam keep track of their balances
macam accounts lah apa-apa account bank account ke apa ke like
there will always be balance right then you can see like kau spend on what and stuff like that basically it's meant to
the job is meant to tengok and make sure that the accounts balance cause if there's
something macam off sikit dorang kena track kenapa off and like
why is it off like maybe dia macam
it's either terlebih or terlalu sikit then they must check where it is lah
aku pernah belajar kan I told you right I I think I took it for O level but I never
um bila aku fikir balik
it's not difficult lah it's just that at that time aku tak interested nak belajar tu benda cause like it's
aku aku rasa cikgu aku just dreadful agaknya ah
but ya then like kalau accounting kan actually ada banyak
ada banyak sector cause you can do auditing you can do ah bookkeeping
if you are an accountant kan kau macam
in a way kau boleh jadi your own boss I guess
I don't know I'm that's the way my parents put it lah but kalau kau
ada macam some form of background in accounting senang sikit kau nak
dapat kerja in a way
because I think the the main thing is cause you know how sekarang kan pandemic kan
so like ah kalau kau fikir balik the main
mana-mana pun food ada kan and um
these things are the macam industries that won't be so affected for some reason I don't know why
and what ah but like you know ah apa tu
tak interested untuk tengok> but I always see that one scene pop up the one where she makes that comment lah about that guy
oh aku tak suka ah plot macam gitu
you know like what we said about sustainable fashion kita orang no longer ignorant
so because kita orang no longer ignorant I guess um
dorang just trying to fit into
betul like a proper cause that they doing like
like black character to be extremely loud or whatever just ikut just ikut stereotype you know what I mean
nama dia jason like in the show jason dengan
honestly aku rasa aku rasa macam mana I I know I had a point but then like
pasal kita dah berbual aku macam lost my point ah mm
sekejap eh
aku rasa okay pasal tadi kau berbual pasal yang hijab tu kan
yang firefighter and then the grey's anatomy bodoh lah it's so it's ah it's just
low-key aku rasa is because dorang ada
fascination dengan budak
aku rasa dorang ada I think right it it low-key has something to do with also
I don't want to say it ah but I think aku low-key rasa porn has something to do with it because
it's not a uncommon thing aku rasa lah K is not that I know
I mean honestly aku uh bila aku I honestly feel bad for her cause like
she unintentionally might have contributed to that but also bila kau tengok balik
it's not not budak-budak melayu I think
I think in general lelaki melayu I don't know why not all
guys tend to macam wonder what a woman okay the woman can be completely covered tapi dorang will wonder for some reason I don't know how
will wonder what the woman is wearing underneath then aku macam
like aku tak akan pernah fikir pasal dorang punya
tu tau
kadang-kadang dorang ada dorang punya argument kadang-kadang is
but lelaki pun kena kena rogol pe something like that lelaki pun ya they sometimes bring that up as a point tapi aku macam
but why would you like it's not like okay dorang selalu macam
fikir kita orang tak faham or like
we always fight for just kita orang but like we actually fighting for other people also what
it's not just kita orang fikirkan pasal perempuan jer it's that just so happens
perempuan suffer more
pasal kita perempuan like
ikut biology or whatever but then
some of us aren't exactly build to macam
kecil I um kecil
okay ah aku faham
dorang masih buat cerita macam tu macam uh it's either kahwin kaya ke
kahwin uh apa tu bukan kahwin kaya not only that uh
ah kahwin contract
aku tak tahu aku tahu kenapa dorang tak boleh single
like okay aku low-key rasa kan
kita orang uh sebagai melayu kita orang actually maybe we don't really
actually had okay lah kita ada nafsu tapi macam aku rasa the only reason kita motivated by kita punya nafsu
it's also by cerita-cerita macam gini that like promote kita untuk
macam encourage kita untuk macam apa macam
oh kahwin kahwin sikit-sikit kahwin kahwin kahwin muda
kahwin tua pun ada kadang-kadang cerita merepek sia
uh uh kadang-kadang kadang-kadang problem dia dalam perkahwinan boleh kahwin lagi aku macam
like like the common plots is always macam apa kau tak boleh produce baby ke
pastu kahwin kahwin kenapa kau tak boleh adopt ke apa ke like why
I I aku rasa tak akan achieve
kereta I will ask for a car and I also ask for money
and I will also ask for an unlimited supply of kasut
so like so pape kalau aku nak main bola ke main
pakai apa apa-apa kasut lah
actually pandai ah
but I think also genie sesuai kalau genie is the one granting your wishes ah
tahu I know I know but then for for shoe right
cam ah makin turun turun turun banyak duit so like
and you know kereta untuk you know gi sini gi sana semua
so kalau kalau aku dah ada duit ada kereta
kasut is for my own needs ah but
apa yang like
tak worth it lah of course it's not gonna be worth it what because like
your life would be macam
life tak bagus ah
dapat semua benda pe
like dorang nak apa like
sorang ada sorang nya opinion pe so like kalau
kalau you know if our opinions are different right then it is what it is ah like ya
so first first first kan aku nak perempuan lawa punya
ah kalau kalau tak lawa aku tak nak
hati kena bagus ah macam hati dia kena bagus kena macam aku nak dia caring loving
okay we talking about this minor details in women that I look for of course there is lah there are a few ah so I'll tell you about my life ah like I can be honest ah dalam hidup aku kan
aku keluar dengan tiga perempuan jer tau
tiga perempuan the first one she can make me laugh she uh boleh buat aku ketawa semua ah
tapi kan dia take it one step too far she make me laugh too much
like macam dia suka main-main aku text tak nak reply semua then abeh berbual serious
serious punya benda dia
dia macam buat macam kelakar semua then you know
she ah dia tak boleh
handle jokes semua then kena aku selalu kena care for her ah like
takleh kena takleh kena sikit ke apa ah
then bila berbual dengan dia kan
nak buat macam joke kelakar semua kan dia dia nak sepak aku sepak muka aku ke apa ah nak cari gaduh so the third one right
to be needy you know like I don't want her to be too needy like selalu
like dia selalu macam
so like semua benda semua benda dia
like cari aku
then aku kena pergi sana jumpa dia berbual dengan dia dia nak nangis aku kena gi sana semua
cam dia tengah contact dengan uh satu orang satu laki ke kau takut ah tu
feeling feeling kau macam mana feeling
happy gila ke apa
you're like in a fifty fifty state of mind lah kalau dia reply then
kau berbual kalau dia tak reply then
buat bodoh jer ah
ah aku kerja ah aku kerja kat ni
kat kau tahu SingPost
ah aku kerja kat SingPost ah cam
aku tengah kerja morning shift eh tak silap morning shift

so like macam start conversation dengan dia ah cam
did she seem like interested in you dia macam
um ada tunjuk kau dia ada suka kau ke ada
I couldn't take it lah aku nangis cam day and night aku nangis nangis aku pun tak tahu asal aku nangis
kalau aku fikir balik ah aku tak tahu pun aku asal aku nangis
minta dia nak minta break
dia nak minta breakup then aku dah macam
bukan lah like we never say anything but we there was no like
like kita kita tak label
kita macam boyfriend girlfriend mata air tak
kita tak macam kita macam just go with the flow ah
boleh cakap gitu ah go with the flow jer
cam jadi emotional ah
like kau tak nak let go dia cam gitu jer kau nak macam rebuilt semua you know
sial lah aku pun nak sia kalau first try dapat macam boleh cam like the perfect girlfriend
like the perfect wife ah boleh cakap
this one aku tanya kau ah kalau kan
tak this is different because right anything you want for free
satu benda jer benda free
tak tak muak ke hari-hari makan Pizza Hut
so like you pretty much just stalk her first ah cam tengok orang ni macam mana
so macam gitu ah
ni perempuan macam not bad ah
cam this is the one ah
kira kan macam fade ah
macam kalau kita punya break up macam
kau punya macam senang macam just ended smoothly like no hiccups or anything then okay lah boleh jadi kawan tapi macam
kawan pun bukan macam best friend ke apa ah macam
kawan macam low-key macam boleh cakap ah hi bye friends ah
tu technically kawan tak ah you know what I mean
but then kalau break up macam rabak kita macam gaduh semua kan tu like
try jadi kawan balik macam susah kan macam
untuk aku kan like ah kalau aku just break up then aku nak move on it takes me like at least at least ah four months I would say
it really depends on the person ah like kalau aku cam
kalau aku handsome gila ke apa ke then uh
senang-senang dapat perempuan semua aku tak kan move on
berapa berapa lama kan
it's not wrong ah it's not completely wrong tak salah pe kalau cam care pasal ex kau ke apa it's not wrong it's like
how you say ah like you like imagine if you lost your phone right and kau hilang then
tu benda tu phone kau takleh cari mana-mana dah hilang dah hilang ah
ni mesti macam two years down the road two years the road kau mesti fikir balik eh
phone aku dah aku rasa kat kat sini ke
dorang cakap ah
so like macam
example eh example macam one of the times err
ni perempuan dia nak berbual dengan aku dia sedih dia nak she needs someone to talk to ah pretty much so I just decided like macam tapi aku aku tengah main game
kau tahu game kan macam phone nya game then aku macam
eh sial lah aku nak main game tapi ni perempuan tengah nangis ni aku nak buat apa sia
I I just give another macam aku kasi
alasan ah macam you know macam oh aku busy ah berbual nanti boleh tak see like
I macam tak uh buat banyak
macam you know I do a lot of wrong ah in relationships ah but
it is what it is ah like kalau benda tak
tapi tadi kau cakap macam live in the moment kan that's a very
good thing ah macam live in the moment like it's a very good thing ah
jangan kasi kau sendiri stress sangat
cam fikir pasal duit fikir pasal perempuan for the future macam
tak yah fikir jauh you know
fikir what you have right in front of you like
it's like you don't really think about future I mean you should think about your future when you're getting older but right now cam sekarang kan
kita jangan fikir just live in the moment ah it's like
aku tengok drama jer the world of married
it's about this girl she's very successful macam dia jadi the associate director
in the first place dia macam
tak tahu whether she
he really cheat dekat dia ke tak eventually ah she found out ah and about the girl and everything
then there's a lot of drama with the girl cause the girl macam
although dia tahu that he is a married man dia tetap nak dengan
because the guy has always been macam
so dia the wife
then but then in the end dorang
uh cerai lah
then cerai the the wife manage to take all her wealth back
ah loving loving some falling in love is not a crime then I'm just like apa seh
now like the story I masih kat episode nine so like
the uh kay the son right is so irritating seh dia dah besar pun dia macam
cause dia tak nak
anak dia ataupun dia tak nak macam involve
ah banyak how to say eh banyak rumours pasal dia like you know remember about Diana Danielle also
I mean he really got really really macam soul soulless again

I don't mind as long duit halal and it doesn't involve cooking or maths because I'm not good at maths I mean like if simple calculation saya boleh tapi you nak I buat algebra tu semua mampus
okay oh my god thank you so much you know I've gone for so many interviews kan but then semua orang tak nak orang pakai hijab hijab atau melayu like there was this one tuition centre that I applied for they were like happy with my grades tu semua and then dorang dah dorang accept tau and then lepas tu dorang tanya like for my race lah and then like what language I speak tu semua then I was like oh
I malay and then I give him my full name then he was like oh I'm sorry but um the position has been filled so we cannot hire you then I was like bro you just mentioned not too long ago that you wanted to hire me then sekarang mentang-mentang I kata that
I melayu you don't wanna hire me anymore
entah lah and then like there was another company ah err it was an accounting company so I'm from uh I was from a media course then I have a media diploma then I went for this um digital marketing job and the person told me during the interview that I don't have the qualifications but in order to get a job at their company I need to be willing to buka my hijab
kan so I ask lah kenapa nak kena buka hijab and then they were like oh cause they deal with a lot of um western people western clients european people and these people they don't really like working with orang islam
pada diorang kan pemikiran dorang ialah
kita orang jahat so kalau dorang nampak yang company ni ada pekerja islam pakai hijab tu semua kan dorang tak nak work with this company
and then the thing is the thing that upsets me the most is that they paksa the pekerja kat situ untuk buka hijab there's like dua ke tiga pekerja kat situ at first dorang kerja boleh pakai hijab tau then all of a sudden I think new management ke pe ah dorang kena terpaksa buka hijab cause kalau tak dorang kena buang kerja
and then you know ah sekarang tengah COVID nineteen nak cari kerja bukan main susah kan so those few workers had no choice but to buka hijab dorang kesian seh wah aku macam nak sepak jer muka dorang like eh bro what does us wearing a hijab have anything to do with our capabilities or anything my mak kerja dekat company besar okay it's a it's an american company that was bought over by a japanese company
and in this company my mak pakai hijab pun boleh naik pangkat tinggi tau you know and there's ramai orang islam kat situ in fact one of her receptionist just converted to islam
and they are okay with them wearing hijab so what is this small local accounting company so against orang pakai hijab you know I think that's just them being racist
menyampah seh
and it's not just in malaysia that orang islam boleh pakai hijab like there's a lot of countries out there that allows their muslim workers to wear hijab even though I have to admit lah singapore lagi bagus sebab the racism isn't really that obvious here but still though you know my I my uh obek kan she actually works at I don't remember which hospital but then she has to remove her hijab
and she's not even a nurse she's just what is she doing ah uh I think she was doing laundry ya so dude you are doing laundry you don't even have to face the people like the um orang-orang semua pesakit-pesakit so like why do you have to remove the hijab that's so stupid what does have wearing a hijab have anything to do with doing laundry I can wear a hijab and do laundry also
his group was in a different court sedih seh I susah-susah penat-penat belajar squash join squash but then tak sama-sama pun
diana wants to set me up with her boyfriend's friend and her boyfriend I'm sorry to say this okay if you ever meet her don't tell her that I told you this tapi kan boyfriend dia kan tak handsome langsung
ya so her boyfriend is a muka muka bukan perangai perangai dia okay lah like he's okay except for the fact that he procrastinates a lot
like okay I I admit that I'm no saint myself but and I procrastinate a lot a lot tapi kan dia kan okay like there was this one time where his boss gave him this job two weeks ago and then he promised her on like okay first week second week the friday kan on the day that he was supposed to submit to um his work to his boss he promised diana that he was going to go on a date with her
tapi kan you fikir bila dia start dia punya kerja nope the day itself like the day of submission itself
kan and then on that day I I was out lah so I didn't notice diana texting me and then lepas tu bila I check my phone kan diana was like eh babe you free tak nak keluar I tengah bosan ni tengah tunggu my guy and then lepas tu I I cuma layan dia via text sebab cause I tak boleh jumpa dia I tengah kat luar pe and then lepas tu dia pukul dua baru dia datang then the whole time she was calling him and texting him dia tak jawab dia mengamuk dengan diana
kan and then lepas tu dia tak minta maaf tak apa
ya and then lepas tu dia bilang<malay diana kan err eh I tak suka tau you asyik call I tanya I kat mana huh text I spam I nanti I dah habis kerja I bilang you lah you jangan nak spam boleh I tak suka
kan oh my god I was so mengamuk and the fact that he didn't apologise to her like bruh who the hell do you think you are you are not even handsome okay and that's not the worst part okay so he has done that quite a lot of time lah that's not the worst part the worst is that dia tak percaya dengan tuhan
he said that tuhan tak wujud there's no such thing as god
but but the fact that you call yourself a muslim tapi you tak percaya dalam tuhan like why do you even bother calling yourself a muslim
ya like like I respect everyone's belief lah tapi kalau you tak percaya you you tak percaya lah you jangan nak bilang orang lain you don't try to force your belief onto other people
diana dia bukannya halal sangat
tapi pun dia tetap percaya dalam tuhan you jangan nak shake her beliefs tau huh you jangan nak bilang dia tuhan tak wujud tu semua it's up to her what she want to believe in
siapa dia nak sembah kalau dia nak sembah tuhan syukur alhamdulillah bagus lah untuk dia you jangan nak marah-marah dia jangan nak tengking dia kena percaya dalam tuhan boleh tak you tak suka you cari perempuan lain ah
the lelaki is he's a medic so I don't mind medics lah
makes me sound like some narcissistic but anyway I bilang dia ah I bilang dorang yang oh err maaf ah tapi I'm sure your friend is a great guy tapi I don't think kita jodoh and then lepas tu I kata but then if you nak kita jadi kawan I tak kisah
so you you nak I cakap dengan dia okay but you need to make sure that he understands that it's only as kawan nothing more nothing less kawan saja okay then dia okay okay then lepas tu I kata okay I don't him to have my number I don't want him to have my social media account I don't want him to know anything about me unless I believe that you know we can be friends tu semua lah we can click as friends
right I don't even wah he called me golden child I was like so lost like is that is that supposed to be a reference to anything like I'm sorry I watch anime but I don't really watch other shows like what what is golden child even and then lepas tu dia kata uh he he started going on about how so um our friends decided to matchmake us cause they believe we're perfect for each other then I'm like bruh
I told them that it is never going to work out between us as anything more than as friends so you jangan nak fikir-fikir jauh-jauh boleh tak he really believe that kita perfect for each other tau
this isn't really a matchmaking event or anything so like you tak suka you tak suka lah boleh belah like in a more polite way okay then he just screenshot my reply he sent it to my friend and her boyfriend then they they were like scolding me like eh why are you sending him such a formal reply you know you sepatutnya cakap gini-gini you jangan nak cakap gitu boleh tak huh
kesian tau dia then I was like kesian dia I your kawan untuk lebih dari tujuh tahun okay you tak kesiankan I
kan and then she was trying to sell him to me like oh he has a ducati he has a lot of motor he's a medic he earns a lot like five figure or something then I was like bruh I know lah I I mata duitan juga tapi I tak lah gitu teruk mentang-mentang dia kaya you fikir I akan apa stead dengan dia
I ada standard
kalau dia apa kacak sikit eh I don't mind lah and then lepas tu kalau personality dia okay I don't mind but the thing is he just broke up with his chinese girlfriend of like I don't know how many years they were like going they were like super steady for so long they were going to get married tu semua but then um the girl's parents tak tak suka cause um dia islam perempuan tu christian ke pe
ya so they just broke up then then it's like what am I a rebound you are not even that good looking bro just find someone else I'm sorry man ya and then lepas tu sampai sekarang diana keeps on saying that oh she wants to set us up then next time kita hang out together kan dia nak bawa lelaki tu nama dia rudy
nama pun old-fashioned
eww mad ah bro I don't even like the name sorry wah fuck I found I sound so kurang ajar seh no but serious that's I don't know like I just feel like he's not my type like we can never click there's no chemistry between us like seriously who starts up a convo by calling the girl golden child
dia fikir kan we were being match made tau so he's really into the idea like he told um diana's boyfriend and diana told me that he's really up for being match made with me kan that's that's how I reacted like like what with first of all I've never even met diana's boyfriend okay second of all we've never met each other I I deleted telegram
after he sent me that message and then I replied to him I deleted telegram so um I don't know if he sent me any messages lah I haven't re-downloaded it and I don't think I will anytime soon and then lepas tu kan um so diana kata err oh I have like my standard tinggi sangat lah I tak boleh pilih-pilih sangat tu semua so she's giving by the end of the month she knows where I live by the way
I'm segan too but I would rather be match made with a guy who is at least like who have something in common with me than with this guy you understand why when I send you his picture
tak boleh seh seriously do you know any guy like it doesn't have to be we don't have to be anything more than friends but I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend all my friends all my guy friends are in and they are either taken or seriously weird
I know lah but I betul-betul tak nak seh dengan lelaki ni and I I don't know who else I can go to to ask for like eh you know any guy friends who can like help me out pretend to be my boyfriend for a while cause oh my god everytime I meet her every dude
um apparently um she's meeting up with her boyfriend tomorrow and she said that her boyfriend is going to bring his friend so she felt segan to go along with him because she doesn't know any of his friends but I know for sure that that is code for she's bringing that rudy guy along
cause she'll know that eh tak kan hari-hari ada family matter seh
you know sekarang kan nak masuk masjid you kena macam register dulu tu semua and then satu kali nak masuk cuma berapa sepuluh orang
ya so nope I think I'm just going to stay home but I do need to find a guy ASAP do you think your kakak knows anyone
so ya and then um we there was this one group project where the teachers group us up and then she was in my group so I was sleeping over in school and then after that she kept on touching me and hugging me and wah and then we had a sleepover in school cause to finish our project kan then lepas tu dia asyik macam pegang-pegang dengan I
then like then then like geli seh
she just pindah to like a few blocks away from me in year two and that was when she started um suka I
kan and setiap pagi kan err cause setiap kali I nak gi sekolah I selalu pergi dengan my mak my mak turun kat jurong then I tukar kat jurong pe and then lepas tu kan nanti dalam tau-tau jer selalu I naik I selalu naik kat belakang sekali
like the last door kan second cabin last door then lepas tu I tengok tau
I selalu tak nampak dia tau-tau je pintu dah tutup pusing-pusing tak ada orang dia dekat belakang I
I usually berdiri dekat pintu yang you know pintu yang selalu tak buka
ya I I duduk kat I selalu berdiri kat situ tau I tak nampak dia<malay tau tau-tau dia akan appear dia akan kata
so so I told her that err indirectly like oh um you know um I have a crush cause at that time I was I had a crush on this guy we called him camera guy but I think I can tell you his name ah cause different school pe nama dia
ya but he was err he was in my academic school we were from together and then lepas tu kan um dia selalu macam everytime there's an event he's like the photographer ah so my friends and I will call him camera guy so that people won't know that we're talking about him
ya and then lepas tu that err I keep on telling the girl who like me like oh you know I saw camera guy again today and then he's so hot tu semua then like I would always purposely mention him whenever she tries to like make a move on me
so at the end of it kita semua marah dia ah
then lepas tu dia tak suka I lagi
ya and then there was another girl who like me also and then um that girl was a bit weird lah because she was telling me about how she was asexual and all that then all of a sudden dia kata oh but you know I wouldn't mind dating you
basically it's like I don't really know how to explain it but it's like social innovation tu semua
ya so um we doing gen ed we would combine classes with other courses tu semua so there was this one girl she was from design and ya she was from design school I forgot which design school she was from um she we we went camping together like it was a school camp lah school trip then she was in my group and she was my roommate for the entire trip it was a week long
ya I I I just I just smile and say oh okay sure err I'm just going to do my work over there but you can go on and shower and then and then lepas tu kan so um she's usually not in the room lah like um she she met this she met this uh guy from we were sleeping in a dorm it was a collaboration with a an indonesian uni
my friends and I we will like sometimes we would just sit on her bed cause it was the closest to the door so we will just sit on her bed like all of our beds lah and then some people would just sit on her bed and then usually like we will like macam basah gitu tau dia nya tilam dia you know what she was doing right
at first we didn't know either because we thought okay maybe like dia habis mandi dia tak lap badan dia betul-betul so dia duduk abeh basah and then lepas tu<malay last day kan bila kita dah nak balik then she just told us oh you know the reason why it's always wet then we're like why kenapa you kena bilang kita like at least okay you bilang kita at the end of the trip but but why kenapa tak bilang kita at start atau you tak bilang kita langsung
I did not need to know what I touched I oh my god and then kan the whole trip she would comment on my badan tu semua tau like oh um
apa cause um she's very open her boyfriend is also super open
she said um if if she's ever like uh if she ever wants to do a threesome dia nak panggil I then I was like okay you ada nombor I and then lepas tu lepas tu I tak contact dia lagi
kan and you fikir it was a one week trip okay or was it two weeks it was almost two weeks actually mak mak I I I tak tahu nak nak happy sebab orang ingat I cantik atau geli sebab I terpegang benda tu atau oh my god I don't even know what to feel man
you ada you ada gambar dia
so err he confessed to me in it was in june holiday I don't remember which part of june holiday and then lepas tu kan uh he he suddenly texted me one four three then I was like one four three apa benda seh so I look it up online lah like I I didn't reply I was like looking up what is one four three then apparently it was like this um
so it means I love you and then I was like oh hell no bish like first of all I felt nothing for him second of all I I was in this um it wasn't really a relationship but our I had this thing going on with primary school friend lah nama dia irfan
so I just muted him lah like oh I'm really sorry bro but I tak suka you so maybe you should just you know move on lah but kita lagi boleh kawan and then he was like okay then he stopped texting me then you know what he did

so I kata okay lah I forgive you then kita jadi kawan but then we didn't really text a lot and then you know what happen

so um he I think he bought her a lot of stuff juga lah and then lepas tu uh the one that crystal like was I think it was justin
oh my god dude you know that was my favourite time you know why cause kan um everytime justin tertidur kan then uh he will like depend on me to like take down notes for him tu semua then I tolong dia dengan homework then I betul-betul jaga dia tau so everytime I selalu bawa bekal gi sekolah pe then he would makan my bekal like we would share share tu semua tau
abeh dalam kelas kita selalu main-main sama-sama like
we would play with our phones under the table tu semua tau and then like he he started like suruh I main-main dengan rambut dia
sedih<malay> seh we wah we could have something on damn it but ya I don't know man sedih
hais okay lah um it's been one hour lah so kita end sekarang
what are you doing bukan how are you doing
oh ya I forgot how is your haus kau batuk lagi ke
mm cause aku perasan juga like I notice your cough in your um videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and um and also like when you have kahak in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not um clearing her throat first before she talk
kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
susah tak nak pakai tu like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
oh I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like lambat
orh kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak inhale like deeply ah
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school pun I used to have bad coughs yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama
I have kahak so I have a lot of kahak that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so dia macam satu it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
ah so macam sekarang ni I can recognize it lah when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
macam at that time I think I didn't know cause ah before
actually err is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is um tempeh
err roti kicap
I know I know no but ya I think these three yang betul betul I've been avoiding because
err at first memang I avoided everything I avoided like vitagen yakult lah yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt ah apa tapi macam kalau yogurt is in mm is like a flavor aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak lah
dia is is in at yeast allergy it's like um err fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast kan is a product of fermentation ah so macam tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan because it's like soy bean fermented
ya macam tu sebab lah is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because macam tu lah because uh in some kadang-kadang aku makan
err apa gatal but actually you know uh when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new macam active err areas yang gatal and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad ah episode of sinus punya ni like selsema for like one month
so my dad told me to start err drinking yang effervescent tablets tu barakah
so I did and then he ask me I started err started drinking that and then he said that oh ya it's very bad padahal kan I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains um macam yeast ke apa but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
err so err tapi recently because I at first I memang betul betul jaga my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat kicap because kicap is such a common common thing kalau kau masak kan
so dia
ya ya no at that time she's making nasi goreng sambal sotong tau like leftover sambal sotong so dia letak lah kicap tu sikit just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like aina I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put kicap and I was like
tapi I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so malam tu aku macam aku dah ready lah untuk makan ubat
so at that bad macam is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the gatal pun dia kurang lah I can control it so when err after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
so macam I should start
trying out food yang I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay tapi aku kurang lah I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
ah cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti
err kicap tempeh yogurt jer lah
actually supposed to go and see the doctor bulan enam but at that time kan I was ah I couldn't go because clinic tu dekat tangkak
ya tangkak kat johor but it's far lah
you know why because is betul betul dekat hujung
betul betul dekat hujung dekat singapore like really is like there
so macam
because especially because my house is err dekat danga bay which is
and then my window is facing the um memorial the sungei that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats ada kelong and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya tapi I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger kan mm kalau kitaorang balik johor
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings kan dorang semua dah ready bawa passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari um like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
dorang some some ah dorang tak produce dorang tak hantar that brand dekat malaysia
so they will go there macam is a trip for them and then kitaorang budak-budak would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
we'll all be like so jealous wah tak dapat ikut pergi singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore dengan malaysia takde beza
sama jer kan sebenarnya
ya it's the same I think ya sama jer it's just that you know at that time I was like wow singapore
ah that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the memang my family memang suka makan roti kitaorang we can go through like one bantal yang besar tu like two days so now substitute is wraps lah
mm so macam always ada tu or you know like prata yang frozen
ah kalau if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
croissant croissant itu memang one of the benda yang paling kelakar
because kau dah terbiasa
ya apa
kan cousin aku kan belajar
tunggu jer lah lunch is almost lunch time
usually kau yang masak ke
um I think dia tak not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
err routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize kan it's not it's not just um sapu lotion on dry skin you have to be bilas with water first and then you have to pat dry and then baru you lotion because then baru dia ada moisture
ah ya ya tapi macam you know if I if I mandi awhile like
wear it bilas and then I put lotion and then is very effective kalau you moisturize it overnight
dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga that's why you know when I was
mm but when I was younger and it was bad memang my mom would paksa
err because sometimes it hurts tau untuk mandi cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
so macam masa tu kan I
ah tak tak
yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia powder tapi dia dalam capsule
ah and then eh that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills pasal kau tahu uh sampai menangis like I tried to eat it until I cried
I open the capsule onto a spoon lepastu aku makan
it's disgusting tapi
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know potong tiga ke to get used to it instead of makan powder jer
tapi dia macam faulty lah
can jap I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like uh after I register tak boleh nak log in pun
tak tahu lah dia punya website dia macam faulty tu yang si nai cakap semalam dengan doctor john
ah you when you register to use your apa punya account
try lah nanti apa I think they need to um solve on their site before they do before you can log in
I get it I get it lah but thing is kat you need like a car
ah tu jer lah I think that's that's really the only macam problem that I have
ah itu jer lah tak banyak pun tapi they haven't responded to my email
aku dia ada dia ada dia macam err inquiry box dekat website tu
ah so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive um interns undergraduate internship apa ya program
tapi dorang tak reply maybe I need to email them directly
ya actually I I agree dorang punya one of the malaysia punya government or any authorities when punya weak link weak point is that dorang punya website is very poorly handle
ah bukan tak pandai they don't see the need
ah macam kita kan apa-apa pun kita akan website dulu ah website website
so tapi aku cari lah kat johor kat johor pun banyak juga
more opportunity banyak tempat but it's definitely gonna be far from my house lah
tapi okay lah as long as you know
yes apa ni apa aku cakap oh when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria kan aku pergi dengan shikin
and I saw um some of the stuff dia tengah macam recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
macam like writing on the clipboard so aku tanya dia aku tanya dia uh kalau apa dorang ambil aquaria ni ambil intern ke lepastu dia kata dia pun intern
ya and then she said that uh apa I ask lah yang selalunya yang feeding kan yang diving and feeding tu dia kata anyone that has a diving license boleh I'm like ah
ah tu lah I wonder also
jauh lah tapi it's either you have a long commute atau you sewa rumah dekat situ lah sewa bilik
kau tahu tak fasha fasha nak buat intern kat johor
sebab uh ya lah but she wants to be close with shami dia nak jumpa lah
so this so kita orang macam dah pernah cakap sebelum ni that if she gets an internship in johor I would I mean if we get in the around same area
ha mari mari tapi johor ni kan besar so we don't know lah
mm mm tak tahu kat mana tu jer ah when I think that
macam is I'm so scared
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship pun susah gila nak cari no no company would want
mm tapi
tapi I did see some private companies yang bagi internship not bad lah
takde I'm trying to find material for my tapi
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor bagi like
dia dia kan my old title was combining water quality dengan uh macromentoes
so I did my field work tapi since we cannot go to the lab
dia dah published dah tapi dia co author jer dia bukan the main author doctor chan lepastu dia ada data dekat tempat yang sama of macromentoes so aku kena analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper punya data
dia punya paper as a reference for my water quality part
um I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it lah tapi you know ha I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
macam aku aku try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
pastu I go back to it and then aku akan copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
pastu I try to retype it
tapi sometimes it becomes macam disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad tapi tu lah gunanya supervisor
oh laju kali ni supervisor kau laju
last sem aku rasa macam supervisor aku jer yang asik minta ya your supervisor was so quiet
sebab haritu kan kitaorang ada meeting mentor mentee kan dengan doctor chan
uhh macam on the our presentation dia cakap
the examiners all are impressed dengan kita punya presentation
pasal our presentation wise we are all macam mantul tapi when it comes to the writing
ah writing kita ada macam slack
I think must me and my feelings pun macam gitu macam
mm sometimes aku rasa macam oh my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it tapi sebenarnya okay jer
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer yang uh
ah and tapi aku rasa macam my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions dorang akan jawab
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya lah sebab kita nak tahu kan we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
ah memalukan like you feel embarrassed
yang dekat terengganu eh
did you hear about the girl kat terengganu
ah yang kawan ah
wei tu gila dah
ye lepas lepastu dia boleh Whatsapp lagi macam acting as if like nothing
eh bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke
mm macam ramai kan orang punya story macam banyak version
kesian dah like
wife dah lah sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang first kan
but it's so sad lah tapi memang
ada video evidence kan that she entered the house
mm dengan apa I think like hair in her hand
tak boleh log in kan
dah tu lah I think you just wait ah because think somewhat tak boleh tak boleh
I think someone did text the yang apa doctor jaga situ puan puan lin eh
aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh jer
kan dia macam semak
orh dia panggil okay ah
my mum doesn't ask us to help kalau dia tengah masak
ah macam after tu I usually just go and see lah tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta lah minta tolong
aku pun tapi aku kurang lah because aku kan tengok drama yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat netflix
so macam is a lot of more steps to
to watch it tapi sebab you know K drama they are so long
macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ for an hour to watch it
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people punya comments
but I think the K drama yang I watched that had a lot of err long episodes was prison playbook
itu kan I don't usually watch uh slice of life punya drama
I usually watch macam investigative atau medical tapi somehow prison playbook ni
it's interesting and dia kelakar
dia cam just a nice balance of kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar more kelakar than sedih
best tapi tu lah ada episode dia yang one one and a half hours
ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa dah lama dah
sebab you know I'm used to watching um english
english punya series english punya series paling lama pun like forty minutes jer
and then kalau comedy kalau comedy tu
lagi lah twenty minutes twenty minutes jer
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot tapi macam tak bercakap lah kan
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references macam inside jokes
ya dah you know masa tu kan dia kat dalam dia kat channel hallmark
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode baru
so macam my mum was um was very strict with this about bed times ah usually macam ten tu we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister lah my oldest sister kitaorang akan sneak out untuk tengok
I don't know ah sometimes dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar jer
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know biar jer lah macam
let us get away because sometimes kita kena belajar lah to be
especially because kitaorang kan ramai there's like six of us
ah benda macam ni is like a small thing let it go lah
I used to macam tu lah my sister and I would break um bed time
a lot sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok
baca buku yang I don't know time at first it was bagus you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot kalau kitaorang pergi big bad wolf or sale yang like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to simpan and then the worst part is that we have books yang we haven't read but we want to buy new
ah banyak jer sampai sekarang tak baca
tapi my mom dah simpan semua buku dekat my grandma's house punya store so kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam store tu but I read books on my phone now
wei kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek
anak dia pun ramai tau anak dia like wait eh one five or six tapi semua boys
uh the oldest one it's like us around the same age lah cuma the last one the last one beza dengan the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
uh the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age I think so dorang handsome tau
pernah aku pernah mimpi I was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
ya this is this is is my dream but I often memang get err
often memang get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
aku jarang tak mimpi then
yang macam banyak kali one of it I can remember is that daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil tau masa aku dah pandai drive lagi I always dream
that's like daripada dulu lagi I've been having that that one specific dream
sampai I can imagine it now
tapi actually I
I think it's interesting tapi most of the time
I don't really remember unless I betul betul put in effort untuk remember I won't remember
ah I will that's why sometimes I wake up and I'm in a bad mood is because I had a dream yang
made me ah macam you know it's a bad feeling
apa yang what was
I don't know I don't know why we are in our last semester tapi our lecturer wants to
mm mm tu lah
sabar jer lah
bedah pun did you see her tweet
no did she replied me she said there is someone who replies the list responds to the list in a group pastu aku macam oh okay aku dah tahu dah siapa
tapi dia dapat lagi sorang siapa ah
cuma dua orang tu jer
not sure I remember dua orang tu jer lagi sorang tu I tak ingat pula wait ah I see I got I send you the picture right
cause kesian
mana eh nama dia oh ni oh dia dengan okay lah
sorang tu jer lah that's like really bad
tapi tira punya group macam best cause she got
ah cas dengan tarvin
cuma cuma sorang tu jer yang macam eh sikit
alah dia start march kan
march kita start tak tak kita start intern in march
ya march sampai july
adoi so kau kena your intern has to be there lah
orh boleh kerja ke tak
ah err january tapi
dah prepare I mean they are preparing but I don't know how much they can prepare now that cannot ah selangor tengah kan
dia macam I I asked my mum because even dorang punya engagement pun they postpone
so I asked my mom if it's still uh is still like enforce at that time and tak boleh nak buat tak boleh nak buat kenduri
my mum said nikah jer lah dulu and then kenduri we can think about it later
ya tapi dorang dah ada lah dewan apa semua they have already corresponded dengan that person for now they are planning as if there's gonna be an actual wedding
aku rasa but but because
err we know the guy we are friendly with him ya I used to do it with him so aku rasa macam I don't feel like
ah apa I don't feel like I'm losing her lah sangat
ah and then he's nice I mean we argue a lot tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja jer because I think we have the same like almost similar personality
ah it's like we are both the opinionated and then kitaorang memang minat benda yang sama like we
apa semua so I can talk to him lah about and he's very friendly even to my family
mm casually talk to him so it's nice tapi macam you know my sister getting married
the last one tu supposed to be lelaki but
keluar perempuan so dia tak balance
but I'm grateful because I am right now macam paling rapat with my younger sister
because you know being the youngest she matures a lot more than kitaorang
form four lepastu tak tak matrix
dia adik aku yang last tu dia sorang jer dalam sekolah
kita orang semua dah ni dah
yang aisyah tu
pasal yang atas dia laki eh
tapi kalau kau tengok the difference between my sibilings I always post their pictures

oh tapi rambut dia sekarang dah tak tegak dah rambut dia dah leper a'ah comel gila
I don't know I miss them cause dah lama tak jumpa
best dia makan semua benda especially fruits
dia basically kau suap apa pun dia buka mulut
and then kalau macam my sister duduk atas kerusi kan pastu dia kat bawah and she's like she's standing then my sister holding a fruit and then dia akan tries so hard untuk panjat my sister's legs
adoi tapi dia dah pandai lah main and then she doesn't like cats like you
she's scared of cats kalau kitaorang video call kan and then I'll be like meow meow then dia macam huh where's that coming from where's that coming from dia takut then sekali kitaorang nak kasi dia pegang kucing dia pegang dia peluk aku kuat kuat gila she's so scared

oh ah ah aku nak pergi tampines ah
kan aku kena pergi Daiso
entah maybe aku lepaskan zohor kat sini sekejap
baru aku pergi ah
I mean kalau pergi mana-mana
I tak cerita sebanyak kalau nak pergi mana tapi yang penting err
if I were to go travel I I got a plan like I mean not so plan but if like if anybody got any suggestion eh why not we go to this place pergi tempat ni lah macam best jer ah I just ikut jer ah you punya orang kita lah how about you
and winter will be interesting because tak pernah experience salji macam salji mesti lah sejuk kan tapi from what I know ah
tengok pokok-pokok ah pokok lupa nama dia tapi it's pink in colour merah jambu pokok tu tengok macam dekat bila kita jalan ambil gambar pun cantik apa kan so cantik jer pokok tu I think I like pretty stuff lah I mean who doesn't like pretty stuff like when you take photo it will look good on you so ya
what's the name for the ya so I'll bring them to kampung glam because of I remember masa time dulu ah sekolah rendah sekolah menengah kan mesti ada field trip like they will bring us to a few places in singapore then we can just enjoy right so I remember going to kampung glam
and masa tu time tu sekolah rendah lah dia orang bawa kita pergi ah
it was very interesting at first sight because ah I mean kita kalau macam mana nak cakap ah kita orang melayu pun kadang-kadang pun tak pergi tempat yang kita punya culture where where it is what so it's like when I go there
it's interesting because I found interesting games macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main ah macam gasing or chapteh lagi ada five stones there are five stones
so ya I think I am more attracted dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu lah oh ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam lah macam-macam permainan lah macam permainan dulu-dulu I think I'm
I would not say I grew up watching it lah how how would I explain it dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok drama korea macam cuma drama melayu macam dekat channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so I I bet everybody knows this so masa tu macam ah eh tengok ah boys over
flowers best tau cerita dia ah cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya then nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni then I was like
oh okay mula dengar macam oh okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
like people using fake profiles macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu then orang mesti macam eh I want tinggi wah cik lawa ah buat kawan ah kan
aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau I'm here for you like you know
macam dalam dunia ni itu kan macam movie ah tu kan based on
non-fiction what so it's like bila ada movie macam gini macam wah macam dia orang pakai macam magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
three hours is because uh they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture what ya when making movies lah but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it ah it dia ada macam crime crime scene kat dalam tu
so macam never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
teletubbies punya patung I mean I tak collect banyak lah I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is ah
own macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya character dia orang ada macam barang macam tinky-winky ada handbag kalau dipsy dia ada topi dia kan then ah laa-laa dia ada dia punya orange orange bounce ball
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so macam macam spongebob pun unik juga pasal spongebob berkawan dengan uh dengan apa dengan starfish they call it right ya dia berkawan dengan starfish kawan dengan uh sotong
mesti sudah tentu titanic siapa
siapa yang dengar nama titanic tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal kan cerita pasal kapal
cinta wah that was the first movie also right yang very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting eh yang ini oh I got I got a question for you um if you have three wishes what would you wish for
err terutama saya suka I suka makan I suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan kan I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
food also is something like kita boleh
kita boleh macam explore you can go like
macam try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
uh it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind pasal yang
kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir kan dia macam dia diam jer jadi if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking apa dalam minda dia macam wah
I can maybe like let's say nak buat kawan kita because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people lah if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like oh okay dia ni rasa macam gini-gini maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind what so
I think I mean like that's part of uh your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam
yang kecil-kecil lah you know tapi mana ada yang macam
and like tapi apa-apa pun in the end it's all you know it's all up to you lah actually
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like masuk kedai jer ah nak beli baju ni lah ah kena bayar tak payah bayar okay
I mean just bawa balik I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean biasa lah sometimes kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli eh nanti guna ke tak tak guna eh tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna so
be a healing process because like you plant berkebun I mean lepas tu you tanam any pokok ah any bunga atau pokok yang yang favourite lah kan tanam then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
tanam maybe like you can tanam fruits buah-buahan sayur-sayuran I got a neighbour ah ah my neighbour likes to plant ah
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also macam
ada macam tanam cili padi habis you nak cili padi daun kari daun kari for me it's very common daun kari then ada apa lagi eh macam bunga-bunga
bunga rose I don't know if it's common bunga rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of uh food what
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek kan macam
kena bahan ini lah bahan itu lah tapi nak dia punya process the process of making it is is very hard what so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
ah favourite lagu genre genre genre macam genre melayu ke genre ah sembarang-sembarang apa-apa genre kalau apa-apa genre
err if I were to say well we both like K pop but if genre lain would be macam
genre lagu-lagu pop lagu pop pop like lagu
oh cakap pasal lagu pop macam teringat kalau lagu ah you know pop yeh yeh it's the malays well it I always like to bring back to to the old times then like I say my friend see me as like ah throwback throwback kind of person ya lagu pop yeh yeh is
masa tu memang masa tu kita sekolah rendah eh sekolah rendah kita dah dengar lagu pop yeh yeh that was that was the band that I think that was the first I forgot what's the band's name I forgot what's the band's name but that was the first
ah malay band that I listen to at that point of time I think it's because of my sister like she also listens to this kind of like ya but ya pop yeh yeh ya it's like in dari korea tu biasa lah kan ya for me like lagu irama melayu would be the pop melayu lah they call it pop pop
live music pernah pergi dengan
band ah apa nama band tu westlife
alah boleh lupa pula ah band nama tu ah I pergi dengan my kakak kita pergi because my ni minat uh westlife sebenarnya so it was more meaningful and especially because it falls on her birthday this was back
uh it was last year ya it was last year ya basically it was last year we went for this concert ah this westlife concert it was a very that was the second time I went for concert yang live usually I tak pergi pasal I
ah satu duit kan very ah macam mahal kan tapi like this time round um my sister decided like me and the price is affordable so I was like eh you like this band why not we go also ya so was very
oh ugh my talking about shopping just now right uh fashion style I'm more to a casual side macam santai-santai tak ada anything very dramatic atau macam I suka pakai simple simple just a simple one like
pakai T-shirt seluar
err kasut tak kisah lah kasut ke sandal ah tu jer I'm I'm that type of I don't go for very like dramatic of like like ya I rarely wear accessories too but only recently
so you know me you know my collections I just decided to cause it was it was unique and cool because pasal it was handmade tak pernah nampak macam susah nak nampak ah kat luar tu orang jual macam handmade earring macam
I'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense macam colour
ya I I don't go for macam colour colour macam
macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang you know what I mean right macam you look at wow it's so it's so bright on you like I don't wear bright colours I'm not that that kind
and warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde kan dalam global mesti ada kan so hitam is I think
hitam like is the is the main ah but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about eh ya
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight macam macam mana nak cakap eh kita jumpa orang tu first time then kejar I'm not terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta I mean I
ah faham faham ya ya ada orang pun fikir
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people mesti tengok macam wah dia ni kacak ah dia ni macam handsome jer ah tapi tu ah fikir-fikir balik ah kita like would you really
alamak okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking teh O ais limau dengan syrup syrup limau ya alamak if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup limau dengan teh O ice I will pilih teh O ice
I mean syrup syrup manis I mean I teh pun manis lah kan tapi teh lagi macam lagi like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting wah
it's just mi apa noodle

uh uh memang very haprak I tell you
alamak you calling me sampah
what telah happen
okay boleh
apa makan salad salad
this one I feeling feeling macam your house
tak pergi feeling feeling condo
I think the macam you know
I think the macam I know I haven't go in my room yet
um I think I want to end the call already cause macam very haprak when I hear that
okay ah biasa jer how about you
oh banyaknya
so um we actually met at bugis so then we went to walk around at bugis junction first because we want cause uh we want cause we met late afternoon so we decided to not we decided he ajak me go solat at masjid sultan
so we went to walk around first then around me six fifty then we made our way to masjid sultan then you know now got the safe entry staff so we cannot really um masuk early kan so we had to waste our time first before we go to masjid then
then um like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend meninggal
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know orang tu baru meninggal kan
aku tak expect kau to be like
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him macam
like at that point in time aku tak cakap apa-apa cause
honestly that last conversation kan he dia minta maaf cause um dia tahu yang apa macam
he he knows he's in the wrong ah kirakan then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself pe so I included my own thoughts about that matter ah
over that maybe my words or something I don't know lah but it's just like macam I feel like he could have
if kalau dia datang balik kan
I don't know kalau jodoh jodoh
it's not fair or tak boleh ah macam what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so
yes ya and also macam
when I think bila fikir balik kan
um datang balik pun
if really then I'll give in ah but if not then malas ah
philosopher tak menjadi
yang online friend tu kan
wait wait wait where is he from dia dari mana
is neil the one that it's like the best friend of the one that you ask me tu
so jadi
sekarang kau tak berbual dengan dia ah
I kau ingat sampah
ya that's the first one which was like in april bila aku masih berbual dengan lelaki lagi satu tu
dia masih chat aku lagi
how dah tak boleh balik kan cause
dia masih sekolah kat china kan
any feelings for him again right it's just like macam why why do you want to talk to me like I thought you went back to your ex that she don't like
aku fikir dia fikir macam kita kawan jer kot
why is it taking way longer than when I date with sampah sampah was like
yang lelaki yang kau message kat imessage tu tak berbual lagi
kau babitkan aku though
I want to get back to the online punya
bro I just aku cuma nak kawan I don't want sex
got there was once I met a nice guy and he okay and he's muslim then abeh dia cakap why are you here then I was like why can't I be here like he was trying to be like you know macam mak bapak gitu like why are you here
administrator punya
then I had to angkat the boxes up to the sink
like macam aku fikir
in dalam kepala aku kan aku macam
aku tak akan baik cause
but eh sampai mak aku risau seh mak aku was like
jangan lah nangis
like I asked my mother urut also
tak hilang so I was just like
I don't know how to explain it it's just macam
aku dah cakap jangan pegang kau pergi pegang then I was like
the previous day punya bread

dia macam what
it was my birthday what it's not macam randomly
as of now I I wouldn't want to think macam okay you know wait wait I wouldn't want to think of you know
so at this point of time right macam I can enjoy doing my things without having the pressure to you know to talk to anyone but then
dah eh denial the end that's all folks thank you for
I don't I don't take it as macam you know I'm asking you out on a date
I'm just asking you as macam to hang out lah you know because
eh ada tau
amin yang selalu aku keluar dengan syafiq syafiq dengan amin syafiq dengan amin syafiq dengan amin so dengan dorang
ya ya I going out with syafiq and amin bukannya dua-dua orang macam kita dua jer pe it's not like that
this girl you know macam pergi date semua kan he she doesn't even want to be macam macam sekarang kita tengah lepak dekat macam playground gini kita dua jer kan let's say you are a guy
tengok wayang cinema macam dua orang even though there's there are other people but
is tetap macam korang dua orang jer kan in a dark place also she she's not comfortable with it so
ya so dengan dia kan
macam I think he is ready
tak she didn't
agak then shut the fuck up there and there's so many people adopted messages and I don't give
ya aku suka
cannot right if you rabun
ya I mean if I don't like you then I will just cut things orh macam yang that time the kan I told you yang ada satu lelaki ni
rashid nama bapa nama bapa-bapa sia ya ya but anyway he was
kau tau yang first date tu sial ah we went to picnic and he did all the work sia
no for picnic macam picnic you have to err by the mat and then the the the
when I told when I told people about this right when I told my friends about what he did ni semua kan
but it's just that I don't click with him and I just don't ya so that's why aku cakap dengan kau my tolerance is really
meaning macam if I want to cut you off I will cut you off because I don't like I don't give a shit about you that way
but the thing about him right even though macam gini kan I am fond of him
maybe on monday I will go back to the office saje jer eh I mean
tak lah saturday sunday I will be with my my fam family maybe I will go out with syafiq and amin
dia tak gila kan aku pe no I understand I understand what you mean so as of now

anyway uh laparnya lapar aku aku nak terkencing
no hint kau ah so I was thinking right I would want no I would want to get that for dinner later
the paramedic kat Netflix
kenapa you nak pergi sana
kenapa you think that it's a macam
macam fishy fishy stuff you know
it's cold and you uh tak tahan sejuk you know tak tahan sejuk
so you are you are telling me that kita kena shop before kita pergi korea
I the the thing is that I want to go there sebab I've been there
it's a place whereby I rasa macam
tempat ini bagus untuk bawa partner ah you know
I don't know kalau if there
they have mukshidonna there tapi
I'm not sure if you can apa
sebab kalau you nak shopping dekat sana
bawa benda bring light pack light lah you know
confirm berat
I wanna go there when it's winter tapi
I'm just afraid that kalau
you know lah kita tak tahan sejuk
I tak tahan but you know
I tak I I tak pernah experience snow you know so
mana balik singapore demam if kalau dekat sana dah sejuk obviously you
tak shiok
tak shiok lah siapa nak nak nak fall sick in on holiday seh
but I think you'll like it there lah sebab apa eh
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you pakai lah brand brand itu semua sebab
macam etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream dengan face masks very cheap there
but banyak banyak
dekat sana lebih murah lah compared to you sini ah
we concentrate on korea dulu ah apa cakap australia
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like macam
a road trip tau you know like macam you know melbourne eh like from sydney we drive down to other places
macam we get to see the apa itu
scenery twelve apostle's yang dia orang tengok itu semua
another five years I rasa sebab nak kira-kira plan dua tahun
I dengar husband dia tengah ambil
provided provided if dia masih single lah kalau dia nak kahwin might
by then dah ada anak [kan]
like for me korea I've been there so I bring you to the places that I've been there or maybe to new places that kita yang dapat tahu
I want to try actually but then I don't think it's right lah macam tak
tak boleh ah it's not halal what it's live you cannot eat that
is expensive tapi kalau if you are there you tak buat
kira macam wasted lah you dah dekat sana you dah dah all the way sampai korea abeh you tak
not just crab ah can buy lobster or ketam what
it's it's best to just splurge ah sebab dah dekat sana apa
how to play ini huh
but then I think korea tak ada korean theme park tak ada haunted house lah
I try to find macam
kalau saturday macam pergi sentosa
I will bring you somewhere ah dekat sentosa
no lah not beach lah pakai just wear casual pakai casual jer
resort world tutup kan
check apa ini
nak kena fikir plan B juga seh
last I pergi
two thousand fourteen seh yang
sakit lah
lepas pergi sea aquarium jalan dekat vivo
then beli-beli barang yang tak perlu
I don't realise ini melissa what
is it comfy tak
but I don't like the pattern dia macam pattern wak wak pergi masjid punya kind of slipper
I I saw some of my friends pakai gini ah tapi dia macam wak wak pakai so I don't like
I support no I support the idea of you nak jual
itu mask daripada you nak beli and shortlist semua benda
kalau you buy the mask I will pay for you
tak akan you
makan is because makanan dia they are selling at thirty dollars
no that's why I say you must group the order let's say macam three for eleven dollars
mahal tau you tahu kenapa tak
kalau you tengok
you tengok services of uh delivery services eh like
so berapa
but I think for the start you just buy fifty dulu ah
macam very
macam loud loud colours macam orang might think twice ah nak beli unless it's an occasion ah macam
I nikah pakai itu apa
table dah empat
your mum dah masak
okay jangan berbual dekat sini
but ya lah I have that urge to makan mamak but then again
but adam road mana got
adam road like macam boring ah
yes ada spring leaf
but depends what what time we are going there sebab
eh that time dekat rumah orang
landed property that time we go itu apa spring leaf is it
you bring me there malam-malam lah landed property
there's this kedai apa thohirah eh
you remember tak
yang macam kedai mamak atas ah
dey you lupa eh
dekat landed property
bukan beauty world eh not the beauty world one
tak tahu ah dekat around surrounding landed property ah
dia ada satu kedai mamak terselit but it's the macam spring leaf type ah I think it's spring leaf eh is it
I tak tahu you bawa kereta you bring me I tahu
but I I ingat mahal tempat dia tempat dia mahal

landed property I tak tahu dekat mana you bring me there

aside from jalan kayu yang ada kedai mamak

some amount for the vitamin ini semua ah
because I told him I told him that I kasih dia yang
yang treats itu jer dia cakap oh treats itu untuk
nak train dia orang bukan untuk
treats itu is like to make them obey you
ah macam kucing kan suka benda itu [kan] then they will like come to you
dia jangan forget about me sudah eh that's my worst fear seh
then gini dia tampar
of course ah dia rasa
there's one video that shows that uh satu okay there's two video ah after dengan before ah there's this two cat before video
ada dua kucing then
so yang cat itu the other cat is he keeps looking for dia punya partner
macam you can see that body language dia he's like macam he feels sad ah
dia macam roaming around the house looking for the person
sebab that rumah dah used to have people

lampu dia tak dapat retrieve surat
owner should have apa

malaysia baru letak
uh dua puluh lima ringgit paling murah

not treats ah it's more like macam food lah food based ah
I tak tahu how he feed him lah
dia memang dia tahu I suruh beri dia ayam
kan I tanya dia kau ada ayam sebab kucing aku tak makan ikan
oh sebab I think
my mum kasih dia ayam goreng

so now if they go up one and then the laptop goes up one and then it's like macam bodoh like that you know then now so now it's like macam
macam some of them is like really like very big but hopefully the guy gets a lot of money ah
because they wanted to make the U I like very good and shit one thing about Razer they all always don't optimise their software their software is always macam tahi sia
but I I signed up for Razer pay punya card because got inside

bodoh pe
same lah saman ah fine
ya I mean it's it's normal ah I mean at the end of the day as long as the the whole world is not clear of this thing confirm got one but if you stop them at the boarder then it's fine in the end macam singapore's punya ape itu their way is like rapid testing and shit what so like for them is okay lah
because it's expensive eh you know COVID treatment there is like thirty thousand sia not like us like you go to doctor with like respiratory punya illness or whatever cock and then like you go you ah apa you go there again you get we pay ten dollars they have to pay for a nonsense amount of money one doctor's visit is like hundred plus sia
quite quite a high amount ah like merepek kind of prices ah like here okay ah somebody sick just call ambulance ah next time can pay I mean at the end of the day it's government run so like
at the end of the day if they are able to like do so much for the COVID punya crisis they have a lot of bank lah so
apa lagi kau nak kan
oh they tutup
ya it's always always like that one it doesn't do anything is more of a macam threat kind of thing
no this is this is called no it's diplomacy it's called like macam firm diplomacy lah or some shit like that
because they keep saying that taiwan is part of china like jangan world lah bro
and then like they are not under the world health organisation punya data list because they are not listed as a country
that one that one that one really rabak sia
no now it's worse because of COVID now you know malaysia lockdown you know ah ape tu

they all busy fighting each other also so takpe ah
like the Shell there and that's it then like macam boring eh macam
ya but can is can ah but malas
like ni semua nak tak nak
tapi to me tak nak dia lebih ah so tak nak ah
sad sia all the green ah all the green punya policies that obama put in place all gone
he got a lot illegal shit that he has done he scared kena indicted
that's how he won the millennial punya vote ah eight years back he was one of the first few politicians who was actively like in
come on look look at michelle obama all very ya quite influential in terms of macam presidents
because she's one thing because she's a woman lah and women of colour is another thing and then she is like not not not like black like she's like latino ah and then another thing macam she very fierce
for the benefit of the people you all don't want then you all macam
no the thing is dia world and then people still believe him I like sial ah and recently his rallies all the people wear mask wear at all but when did he ever come out with a negative test
like sometimes they ask celebrities like especially macam controversial issues lah
pissed right he got angry he tweet out and then he say because of the fake news media I will release the video first before the sixty minute come out then I like that's his hit back macam you gonna release it first because he wants to say that macam they gonna portray it like differently but then macam
tak kan they repeat the loop and you didn't realise in one hour right
ya I mean if you say you love the bible right it's like saying you love the quran oh which surah you like you know then you like oh I don't know man like it's private then I'm like
ya no the thing is like no I that people oh ya there was one one guy you know there's this guy that time macam oh who you voting for like that time what he does these interviews with trevor noah like he does these interview at trump rallies and ask all these questions about conspiracy theories and whatever shit lah
so that time he was asking like oh ah ape
ah who are you voting this guy ask lah like this random trump guy like so are you voting for trump this year he's like ya so how how's your uh what do you do for a job then it's like oh no he ask like macam how's your how do you think trump is affecting the economy oh is
or all these like or ape
ya lah so you just camp at the nurses punya houses then you wait
oh dia on dia tidur confirm dia on tidur punya
can cancel you you need to pay or not that time tak ah
dia punya waiting time dah justify the thing ah
ajak fight ah that one ajak fight
online ah then tidur ah then eh dah setengah jam
okay kita start hari ni pelan pelan
ah tak tak
dua jam memang ajak fight
it's like it's like the you know there is the apa tu the video the guy Deliveroo at he didn't want to go up the stairs because this apartment had no stairs
ah that's why aku macam bodoh sia jangan sia like oh my god that's why
I'm going to complain complain man mm you ain't coming down macam sial
perangai asshole sia
but but Deliveroo is like that ah memang the
but macam if there's a lift and then you got an excuse lah
tak pe ah become the cashier ah buka sendiri you know take out the cash
I would mengamok sia like fuck you man
jangan bodoh bro
semalam aku try main twenty then uh it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be sia
starting then you straightaway cam dia kasi kau options nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni so everything was macam flow after flow after flow after flow okay
semalam aku try main it's not like that sia
so ah apa tu kau dah create everything semua once kau dah start the game yet and everything and whatnot kan
apa tu positional positional training tactics kan they give you multiples multiple apa tu
tactic kau pilih sendiri
so formation apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri
no that that is still lah macam they give you pre-default uh
apa style kau nak main in that game for your players to play kan
can depend lah so let's say this game kau main tiki-taka four three one
then the next game kau nak main gegenpress four two three one pun boleh
yang gegenpress tiki-taka is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink kalau these two tak interlink
kau nya formation tak leh work
tak boleh ah tapi kalau kau buat gitu
it also depends on kau punya team punya apa tu familiarity of the tactics ah
ada ada ah
wah itu aku belum check sia actually
but yang what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense ah so macam ah there's this one player dia punya role is a central midfielder
macam their own behaviour in the games lah how they will react in the game ah
but then most of the minor minor leagues ah macam I see I go to the austrian league ke I go to the
aku balik jer dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus
in the span of apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam sia dorang improve
dah empat tahun sia
kalau tak salah dah lima tahun siol
tu kau masih poly so bila kau masih poly kan uh
tu kau year three aku year one so that means ya it's been five years ah
it will be quite late lah I mean for now kalau kau pergi download epic games it should be free pe
aku dah cakap dengan kau dia free
aku tak check
cause aku tahu
aku nya laptop yang I buy is meant for gaming
NVIDIA ada ada
semua ada ah all settle already
but should be boleh ah cause on my old laptop yang aku nya graphic card is based on intel's graphic card tau
cannot do anything punya
highly on graphic I mean you know nya graphic macam mana kan
kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya avatar nya muka dah macam
ah then after that your players pun lari dia pun macam you you know lah the graphic is
macam mana kan so
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is uh kau nak kena ada banyak data untuk kau nya computer ah kalau computer kau tak ada data then
macam tak ada space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then tu yang problem ah but
if kalau computer kau aku rasa ada memory then
macam slack sana sini in bola aku tahu but I
itu aku tak tahu ah how it will turn out lah but then
you can try at least ah maybe when you play the game then cara player dia jalan semua will be a bit
lag sana sini but on top of that
tu touch
not here not there punya type of products kan then I would see why phone will not be able to tahan by itself lah cause uh it's
it's there is too much detail in one team abeh kau tahu dulu kan kau main kan is just
okay player kau gini backroom kau happy dah sudah
settle sekarang dah tak siol
sekarang kan that player ada ada core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
macam this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so you have to push him into the social league ah into social group kalau tak you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
habis ah backroom kau terus habis ah
they influence influence influence influence terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang
so that means dia dia kirakan macam the senior of the group tau
okay so then kalau kau bring in a fresh new guy let's say uh you bring another senior player from this team masuk your team eh
takde gunanya cause
kau senior kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau junior juga apa
then but before that he was from dortmund so bila dia balik dortmund straightaway dia masuk balik as a influential player
a senior in the sense tapi kalau let's say kau bawa uh young players like mbappe over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there pe
ah so no matter how good he is he still get outlier macam aku punya dortmund sekarang sancho is an outlier
so macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam
it's like me when I was in the navy apa
cause kau tahu players kan dorang ada dia punya own friends ke apa benda ke so then they have their own players that they are closed with macam kawan gitu kan so then kalau maybe
you bring him to a new club yang uh
but then kalau kau ada player macam dia suka let's say he favours uh I will give you buckley lah
okay kau bring him to the club buckley ada then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group yang penting is they join the social group
in a sense lah cause it will affect your dressing room nya happiness ah
so kalau dressing room kau tak happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
so your dressing room nya happiness actually
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september tak salah aku
once kau free install it's free forever it's like uh playstation Xbox membership
kau download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library kau uninstall kau install balik pun the game is still be free
it's not your laptop nya LAN cable pe it's kau punya router nya cable pe
merepek pe
computer kau berapa lama sia ni
no Zoom lag it's not cause of kau punya itu Zoom will lag only cause of kau punya connection
laptop kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak
cause kadang-kadang kalau laptop kau is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I tak I mean
susah lah sia kau nak tu it'll be damn slow ah
that game is very intensive sia data dia
aku on tiga league eh aku port aku buka empat league four players per league eh aku nya computer speed jer dia punya processor speed kan for the whole for the whole game tu kan dah four star

there is that thing lah I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab kan yang came out
no kau maybe let's say uh okay cause kau tahu you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad pe so kau boleh remove filter ah hide injured players
merepek sia kau
technically you are apa kan bodoh

eh kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat singapore pe
dulu kau boleh ah tak ada coronavirus you can just go around and ah beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik
kau stuck lah unless they didn't go home they stay in your country ah
ah then gitu maybe uh
kau ada chance ah to play and whatnot lah but if
eh apa tu
maybe if satu hari you go lower than that baru you come out with a semi-pro club
so even if you win games your point kena deducted
until someone else macam you know what
atau they pump atau your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time tu championship which needs five K
but whether your club kat dalam ah the club kau ada loss ke ada profit ke ah there it
tak kira dah cause at the end of day
kalau player kau
ada there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent one was this italian club I forgot what club it was
okay so dah tinggi pe kirakan serie A pe dia up there tau and then
itu lain lah itu tak kira lah bodoh
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist ah terus hilang
nari ada club esok takde club ah gitu ah
so terus takde ah then club dia hilang that's one thing so uh what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan kasi berapa ke
that you know lah some of the fans in this club kan quite rich pe so dorang kata okay you know what aku suka club ni but then sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit okay ah aku pump duit
but ada ada yang lain ah tu really aku tak tahu ah sia kau kena kau kena
cari sendiri ah tu aku
kita ada sia actually
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself apa so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
kita mimpi jer lah tu eh
at the end of day kita semua semi-pro sia
if you're passionate about it then okay pe macam
dah gemuk cakap jer lah dah gemuk tak yah lah
so then macam
tu lah kau baru nak cakap
tak ah
dalam empat tahun jer lah
aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main ah I mean
sekarang dengan situation gini camne aku nak main bola sia
so what this guy did was dia tak slide ah
I'm in front of you I cannot slide aku tak boleh slide tackle kau kan so aku baring on the floor ah
aku baring jer
terus bola will hit badan aku kau will jump over me apa
aku bangun I take the ball run away ah
aku tak pernah dengar sia orang buat gini kau first time siol abeh macam
boleh boleh cause
takde time kan
ah ya lah betul lah I mean
memang gitu lah I mean apa kau nak buat kan
kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit I mean tengok kita sekarang
no lah yang the apa tu
one thing yang we need to go and find kan is that cup lee hsien loong used
eh tu cawan bagus siol kau minum jer kau tukar kau boleh berbual ah bahasa lain sia
aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum ah kau
dia boleh pe
kau tak I mean the the election before the previous election kan
I would listen to melayu if I somewhat understood chim malay lah I mean kau tengok when I had to go for the interview in malay eh nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye
aku gabra siol
aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing ah so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then oh okay sorry nak kena berbual melayu so nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa word ni eh
takpe aku keluarkan english word ah then I speak english again so it's very
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids macam hari tu aku pergi ah aku gi pancing pe kat changi kan
aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan each other kan they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu cause dia berbual english kan dia nya english was
better than our parents lah in a in a sense lah cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so aku macam
okay ni budak melayu and then budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu
melayu is a first language english is their second language
so there's a chance bila kita dah tua
kita tak akan ingat any other language except for
but then you weren't in malaysia apa you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
for example lah kita tak tahu berbual melayu at all dia langsung tak ada melayu okay kita cuma boleh berbual english
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay pe maybe that makcik was sebab apa tu ah dia belajar
english dengan dari tempat lain then dia forever concentrate dengan english
ah abeh kita tak tahu pe anything can happen kan
ah ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak kan apa gunanya aku berbual kan betul tak
all these old people kalau you actually listen to them talk kan some of them do make sense lah I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time merepek sia dengar
ya sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik
oh dia jiran kau okay lah tu kau boleh buat member
aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini so aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana okay lah aku dah tahu ah
mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal ah hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia ah it can be like that pe
all I see tadi err bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni kan aku sesat uh
aku dah masuk lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there aku stuck dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok
tingkat mana sia dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas then in my mind
correct house eh kalau tak malu sia aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan
kau tahu last aku datang rumah kau bila ah
time kau tau
time kau
time kau CISCO aku tak datang rumah kau tau
ada sekali kau datang eh no there was one before after kau CISCO juga aku baru masuk so time kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak
balik rumah kau nak change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so aku teman kau aku datang rumah
then aku lepak-lepak kat living room kau
second time was cause kita nak keluar makan dengan parents aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa that was the only two times ah
to sit down and properly lepak dalam rumah kau ni the last time I did that kita masih secondary school
most of time aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah pe
masih ah kau
tak tahu lah
kau tahu kan the situation sekarang kan you've been unemployed longer than I have
teruk siol
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere kau tahu kan
so kapal terbang dia keluar
pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik ah tak gi mana-mana
no just to maintain airtime and to apa tu free up ah parking space
cause kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang for very long
it can run down macam let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes ah
which is why most of their ah apa tu employees all retrenched
kau masuk if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
kau tak leh compare
mahal that's why they
so the apa tu the postal macam okay ah aku nak buat deed good deed so ah aku nak send out
free masks to every household just for free ah aku send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no aku tak approve ni tak boleh masks tak work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside macam fish nets
kau tahu fishing net kan ada lubang lubang tu kan so mask dia berlubang
and then kau pakai so case kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung ah tapi kau masih pakai mask
ah ye mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work ah kirakan
so dia orang like um
dia orang want to dia orang exit already tapi dia orang nak masuk balik so when they want to masuk balik and then like the security guard stop them lah
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but dia orang like um
they insisted coming in lah and then lepas tu they block the way and then this security guard was like um he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched lah lepas tu dia
lepas tu dia punya couple tak happy lah habis tu dia orang um so like the security guard
lepas tu dia cakap oh like I nak pergi beli uh I nak pergi ambil allen key
ah dia nak pergi ambil allen key lah daripada dia punya service counter lepas tu um
after they take the like they want to take the allen key lepas tu dia cakap eh err please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's dia orang punya pasal lah
err when when they left I ask this security guard lah like you know um like tak kisah pasal dia orang lah sebab dia orang um they they were trying to be difficult lah because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so lepas tu another security guard datang lepas tu dia cakap oh err this couple lah they have a problem lah they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark lah why why
why um why do you err err how did he touch in the first place lepas tu
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
lepas tu there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
eh tak boleh cakap nama dia
tak boleh cakap nama store
tapi like you are not supposed to eat there lah because
takut you expose yourself to
ya lah lepas tu dia argued dia cakap oh my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
lepas tu we're like no
jadi dia cakap lor you know like um
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down kat rumah and then like melepak tengok tengok youtube macam my bapa so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
oh like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like pahala I'm like sometimes kan you buat kerja bukan pasal pahala you nak buat kerja pasal you nak care for the person you know
lepas tu you tengah cleaning buntut lagi
you nangis
ya lah tapi you nangis ke tak
macam you kasih birth to anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu kind of thing
wow nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa tau
you tahu kenapa tak pasal I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so kalau you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
tapi like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things macam even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like oh I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop lah or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like memang like I think it's just human nature lah like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
tu memang dah macam amanah lah pasal dia sedekah gaji itu kan
mm alhamdulillah banyak rezeki
you macam apa tu um in debts lah
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like kalau is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like um
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
tapi at the same time meh pasal dia punya selfish thoughts macam begitu he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like bila dia dah meninggal like you have to live your life and his ah if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to jaga dia bila masa you nak you nak belajar
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
correct because I mean I understand lah kalau you ada family kan tapi tak close dengan family tu macam like saudara saudara tak tak rapat kan
tapi like um in terms of helping right ya lah like that lah but like like you just have to help your family lah you know
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
lepas tu like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point kan they will like going to get married soon they'll like eh nanti bila kita kahwin uh
kau orang suka tolong-tolong kan nanti kita err kita kahwin kau orang tolong ah this kind of things it's like
I don't think that's how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
ah even when there is a wedding they tak datang on time dia orang datang lambat even the people that they're supposedly close to ah like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin pun datang lambat so I feel like ni apa punya attitude ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin and they're going to breed this kind of
job but err my step mum ada lah tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak then I'm like ya cukup cukup cukup
tapi like I told you before right like my father memang apa macam babi like you know like he fucking like um tengok
tengok youtube every single day pukul
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to mengaji then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that ustazah he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I ustazah say lah like like you know like
err perlahan-perlahan lah baca lah kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau err perlu err ulang lah lagi tapi I cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main video saya tak boleh concentrate lepas tu ustazah macam awkward lah macam oh okay
for me right my my bapa is
macam pemalas jer gila babi tau
like satu dia like dah lama tak kerja and he's just err waiting for government to give him money
and then like um err what do you call that like dia tengok youtube videos every single day pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh on kuat-kuat until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
um electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar
dia tak nak kerja then um ya then I just keep quiet lah like it's your problem what I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever lah you know
err he got his heartbroken and dia dia nak console lah kawan dia lah
lepas tu kawan dia punya crush
err slept with eh will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me lah I like dia tu bukan you punya girlfriend couple dia punya crush sahaja you you nak sad sad lepas tu you nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam
you nak um act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
do you know what my father say he say um oh jadi kalau kalau adik kalau um pergi keluar dengan dia eh nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja coke ke apa ke
lepas tu macam mana you tak darah up kan so I darah up I cakap
kalau nak kalau nak ah jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap
err dia cakap dia macam nak weekend excuse lah macam dia joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
lepas tu what the
ya I mean like fuck man like dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak my father lah dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia lah pemalas
put clothes in the the washing machine and then err gantung which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like kerja um kemas rumah masak lipat baju makingkan dia kopi
I mean mm tapi kalau you old school kan you kerja apa
jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi tau and then I even have like I'm working with a guy um this pakcik he's about seventy plus seventy two
dia masih kerja I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty lah this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to macam kasih dia duit you know what you mean lepas tu I tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab I tengok dia unproductive I rasa macam beban tau like
oh kakak you know err we were talking about how when you die right and then um um
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the bumi right
my step mum cakap dia tak nak jumpa my bapa
ya lah so in bumi you ada mark like husband and wife right tapi in syurga you nak you you still want to be together or not
ah my mum say tak nak myself say
I can see sometimes he's caring but ah as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that macam became geram became macam kau dah lah pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau also nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa
lagipun right half of our lives he never raise us and huh correct dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak expect kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke correct
I mean we don't think like that lah tapi my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya so for me right usually kalau I nak kasih I kasih my step mum lebih macam say
he also likes to count people's money mm macam dia cakap oh like your sister mm dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua like berapa ribu lah
lepas tu he like to compare oh kalau your sister kerja dekat singapore the versus your err brother-in-law who's who kerja dekat malaysia dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih I duit macam gitu
like itu yang kasih you marah because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident lah but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right jadi um my step mum yang yang he was refusing to give
because he like calculative say oh you from the kampung you indonesian lah blah blah blah balik kau punya kampung blah blah blah blah blah blah kalau aku tak kahwin kau
like you punya life tak better lah blah blah blah blah
macam gitu sampai sekarang tau dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran kan I tak suka
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you tak nak you nak duit delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother pun macam I rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam my bapa tau like dia selalu dia cakap mm
lepas tu me and my eldest sister we're like kau boleh born dalam poor family tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya problem
allah dah kasih kau banyak avenue untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak blame orang lain
and like err play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged eh and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that jadi I feel like wah kenapa eh like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
tak tak tak I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
so macam I don't know man it's like
tapi sector macam mana
I tak boleh I teach drama and english before
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like oh I'm just contend with sederhana which I cannot relate to
poyo siol
yang you yang you yang you what um apa tu err this this answer thing is it like um it's like a notes for the exam lah
but I would say it's because of err bumiputera but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay mm there's a difference
it's cheap what you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people lah like I tell you before right macam kalau you nak beli benda sana kalau you tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana
I keluarkan lima puluh ringgit I bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk shampoo is tak memadai it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
dia tu yang yang itu lah yang err text you yang tanya is you
ah kau memang dasar orang melayu
kau yang babi eh nak orang putih padahal kau hitam babi
sawo matang oh okay
mm kan you punya suara kan macam abang-abang pun
macam apa number one candidate untuk orang kahwin lah
ah you tak bilang
eh tu tak fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people
ah nanti you you tunjuk I ada gambar
tapi you tapi you
pergi keluar dengan kawan right like another guy right
kita jadi in ah kita jadi in pasal kita use triggered jadi budak kecil
ah tiga minute lah
tapi um I feel that kalau you excel very real like you will be like top top one top five percent maybe they can offer you like uh there are some companies would like sought you out you know then like um give you accommodation and all that and then get you to stay there to work for them
tapi um
okay today good day for you semua okay
location penting but
provided let's say there's no more COVID there's no kan macam we can still go down and like there's a lot of eateries museum
hey okay firstly it is not a sports mall a sports mall is actually dekat novena which is to velocity
right secondly it is a mall for all ages and all people from all walks of life so kalau let's say you're a foodie there's lot of places
to go to let's say you are very hip and you like there's a place for you too and let's say you are you are someone yang macam suka
macam gini ah
I am stating the facts of the funan mall and I am I like that mall I mean you dah pernah pergi dia punya rooftop right and the views from there thanks to me who brought you what do you say about that
aiya ya my one of my friend pun tried to go up there dengan kawan dia juga then macam eh okay
but actually kalau view from the top of parliament is actually lawa juga cuma I think only special people or special circumstances allows you to use the drone macam gitu ke
but wah kalau
your drone kena shoot down seh kalau you fly
mm betul juga
I just read this article um one of the big hotel chains also tak ingat apa nama hotel itu ah so they are offering
ya tak ingat
do you think mothership articles are like legit and kita boleh percaya
hmm macam
what I feel is that the mothership feels like SGAG kind tapi they are more seniors I tak pasti
is this going to be a funny answer ataupun serious answer
okay I'll make a guess mungkin SGAG
well as compared to my point of view macam I follow both SGAG and mothership on their social media so
wow so old fashion macam zaman-zaman dulu bapa bapa
tapi checkers macam
wait dam
oh dam lah okay okay
cause sampai sekarang kan I don't know the difference between dam dengan chess wait chess is the one dengan the horses things right
oh okay dam yang bulat itu yes okay my grandfather pun main dam
ya sometimes I katak bawah tempurung
so uh your grandfather your ada ada the dam
checker board yang dam itu
your family ada
a bit yes macam dulu-dulu pernah lah like you know someone taught me I think my grandparents or
come on this time of night you want to play this kind of games diam please
where were we oh tadi cakap pasal dam
dam is the one yang macam
um there's waves actually alhamdulillah
I tanya pasal apa I tanya pasal dam okay okay
oh jadi yang kotak putih itu is like supposed to be like non-existent
so let's say ada dua player right so I'm player one you're player two so I
put my pieces on the black boxes tapi you put the pieces on the white
okay faham faham
you cannot move back tapi boleh move forward
ya betul itu
nanti you shiok sendiri
come on lah maybe I just I perempuan seh
do you know last I think I dengar pasal mister softee is like
sekarang slurpee jer lah masih ada
or certain um outlets sahaja
eh jangan gitu lah
kita boleh cakap english dengan melayu jer tau okay
oh my god talking about mister softee now I feel like eating ice cream macam mana ini walao

dia dah um refurbish and upgrade is it
um when I was in school macam doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening macam at that point of time we don't feel it lah obviously cause we too young
to experience it tapi
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so macam more comfortable
ya do they still find it macam alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore macam cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me kan kalau
I drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself pula on my own
with my parents et cetera macam it feels very alien
I pergi tempat lain gitu it's not somewhere that I'm comfortable with actually unless macam
no other places in singapore make you feel janggal like out of place except sembawang
macam you make your own decisions and stuffs
levels like what period in time of your life macam you
five years five right lima
no dark past I'm digging out from you you're safe okay tak zilch
also I think ya I think pun like for me I was in poly what so macam we were like what eighteen nineteen right

perk up the spirits perk up the spirits tau jangan macam gini lah

acquaintance too young to learn the word acquaintance back then tapi that's the fact
actually I didn't have a lot of good memories dekat

you literally just nak leave singapore just for the sake of it after all this
rehat and relax at the R&R

legit macam snow and driving is no easy business of the sleepy roads and everything wow
abeh it was
snowing very hard sampai kalau you stop at the traffic light kan there's no one go on um to the front mirror
and then you need to macam every rental car they provide you with a shovelish kind of thing
I hope one day I mean all these will go away lah inshallah you know just dua for the best
that much anymore macam I get so annoyed cause of him
I mean macam part of me like ya lah you have it I try to be considerate cause it's um human rights issues and racial issues tapi

because of this COVID tak ada banyak wayang movies yang keluar right so macam there's no point interviewing having a panel also
and another one is uh one the first harry potter book then like the actors of the movie or like random actors they dia orang baca buku itu
you so funny ya allah macam ugh eh dia dia dari new zealand kan
tapi macam it's like thank god
abeh dia boleh buat suara dia macam mmhmm mandolin orange oh ya that one mandolin orange was the last
talking about funny guys just now dalam kereta I heard the national day songs ini on warna
on warna of all channels
tapi honestly after listening to the game kan macam okay
pasal we grow up in the era where all the songs macam
so tak dapat
uh aku rasa wishes ni mesti lebih realistik lah tak boleh yang merepek-merepek lah okay kalau realistik wishes aku rasa aku nak get rich lah one of it lah one of it maybe untuk get rich
the reason aku nak kaya pasal actually err aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan
then kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi fit ah aku nak jadi fit aku fit aku rasa macam aku pergi lari ah err dekat bedok reservoir ke macritchie ke I feel that uh my body feels good lah so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
superpower okay so err we are moving from realistic to not so realistic ah okay so superpower kalau boleh aku nak teleportation teleportation kalau tengok cerita X men eh dia sikit-sikit macam night crawler
err so kalau teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
um to a certain extent pasal lah tu err bila teleportation okay kononnya tak ada teleportation eh macam sekarang ni
kita dah kena expose more err how should I say it uh more unknowingly for example kita naik kita squeeze squeeze dekat
kalau kita squeeze squeeze naik atau naik taxi grab driver ke taxi driver ke ah kita expose in that uh area kita duduk kat dalam ke kat dalam kereta ke
untuk beberapa minit ini ah ada yang research cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang
jadi kalau ada measure measure contohnya macam uh sanitisation
let's say nak pergi giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
and I rest at work and exposed again ini tak boleh kalau kita dah teleportation teleportation kita skip all the buses ni semua ah all the transportation ini exposure
ah tak kan begitu
but then when this err banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan mm apa ni orang kata
kena pergi kursus ah kursus-kursus um macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer
menggunakan aplikasi word excel kenapa teknologi telah berubah
jadi mereka dah behind time so ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin okay kut
okay lah eh jap err kita err
saya teringat something ah yang pasal teleportation ah kita uh ni eh reverse sikit ah eh teleportation eh kononnya teleportation ni kan boleh kita boleh teleport
um bila kita umur sepuluh tahun
uh kira-kira ni macam so called macam time machine begitu ah uh macam advance yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya invention tapi tak tahu lah dah ada ke tidak ni
uh jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh teleport reverse time eh maybe kita teleport ten years old
nak cakap apa dengan awak punya uh diri tu okay kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia
err salah satu err experience yang aku pernah mengalami ah adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit lah ah tapi dia real ah
dia err it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving uh at tioman
bulu roma ternaik ah bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku
jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga so err saya tengah bawa macam biasa
tiba-tiba err saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan err di road tersebut lah di jalan raya tersebut
jadi err bila saya bawa
the person a a driver the driver that uh was err almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily err nothing happen tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja
tapi itu pun okay itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa
ah itu adalah uh experience saya lah yang near death experience or rather I would say a near miss ah how about you furqan
oho dah macam pantun berkerat
yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen uh yang tu semua lah uh dia orang kerja trip
lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut number of trip kalau dia orang

younger person also they would be more like oh a younger person maybe I can hentam ah ketuk this ketuk this
beratur like satu jam dua jam ah but this one
for their own ubat ah they cannot what cannot wait you know you see that's the difference ah
you know now COVID nineteen right so macam banyak
ya I don't want to find like some kerja itu semua
can freelance but I also can like you know I can kerja like under a creative studio or
what should I do because when it's COVID nineteen semua benda macam
semakin menurun so I've been thinking about internship
because I'm I do macam you know the video ambil ambil video kat kat video ah I do like
poster poster buat buat poster but for their events
but it's just that my designs macam I my direction
not how to say ah macam
tak ya bagus bagus design sangat it's just
lesser design elements so macam tak berapa
I were to be versatile or what I think I need to like macam gain experience
closer closer to what I'm what I want to do lah you know what I mean like magazine editorial ke apa ke you know
ya ya but like mm it's a bit hard especially COVID nineteen lah like what I'm saying macam dah dah ada ni penyakit semua it's like it's hard to even go out it's hard to
that are related to my career it's more to like macam survive ah like tak ada duit you know like you know like now like
err I feel quite sad lah like sekarang zaman sekarang our our like generation like
survival ya so you just take whatever lah ambil jer like what else
masak masak kan ah ah masak masak so like even now your I feel like your industry also kena affected mah
what what we the future future contain cause like I feel like COVID nineteen kan kan dia teach you how to humble down and like
around you at the moment so like live the moment you know ya macam kalau you plan your jauh pun then your plan not
go to plan then like you will feel upset something then macam nak give up gitu kan so
I just hope for the best but not too much don't expect too much that kind of thing but like I feel like if we do out best in in anything I think boleh lah boleh lah we can make it lah
ya budak budak sekarang like okay I would say like now there's a lot of like
there's a lot of new things maybe like new food or what that kind of thing like for example bazaar you know this ramadhan can't go like mosque or what
yes it's also affected kan so macam a lot of
and like how to say I feel so macam deprived gitu macam tak ada orang nak cakap it's not that I
aku selalu actually middle actually aku ambivert ah
aku actually ambivert but basically I choose if I want to
like but now I prefer to be alone ah but it's just the people that I macam nak
siapa siapa yang I'm close to I want to just just meet them like okay I have a few other friends with it I think like I'm sure you
ya so macam ya now I'm introverted and I'm not mad about it but it's just that
since we're in our house macam kita kat duduk kat rumah kan it's more like oh sometimes we are so blinded macam
more changes to more ya progress to like macam make singapore more
like the quality semua ke apa kan like more err out there
macam kau yes correct correct
macam tak like tak ramai sangat yang
setuju um I don't know what I'm talking ah but like they don't agree
ingrained already it's like oh eh um aku dah apa I'm already like brought up this way from my
parents I need to be this way that kind of thing so they're a bit stubborn macam
degil sangat lah you know what again but I really hope that
they start to macam open up sikit and then more or less
what rakyat you know caring you know like I hope singapura macam
I don't know economic macam image you know like how macam singapore nak
that like banyak banyak gaps a lot of gaps
so aku lapar sial aku lapar sial like
you know I'm lapar I don't know what to eat also
but it was not bad and I found out that it's actually halal because the the is new
there's no halal sign so I asked actually halal it's just that it's processing the
now you just kau dah apa kau dah shift aku punya ah mindset sekarang to pasta
ya I don't know uh macam dah lama sangat
that one is like kita punya own timing punya break
I'm not a person who'd bangun pagi oh my god
I want to because is it yang mcgriddles tu dah dah
sedap seh I feel it's very nice eh but I'm like
sorry McDonald's kenapa kau selalu bagi mcgriddles macam sikit sikit jer
ya macam betul seriously sia
but uh everytime after makan breakfast I will tend to have diarrhoea sakit perut
the mcgriddles punya I think the heavy one is the egg one
ya ada
boleh boleh ah boleh ah boleh ah tak lah kat secondary secondary
actually I can recall almost banyak ah
I don't know ah chill eh kejap let me think let me think
okay lepas tu
my I join err apa ni floorball
ya macam C division itu semua B division
other orang yang macam dah tahu main floorball
to macam beli stick itu semua ah so I made my own stick
ya I did ah I used macam sapu kau tahu penyapu dia punya yang wood tu ya
but I use a normal you know kiddy ball macam eh kiddy ball
macam budak budak yang kids suka main tu yang bouncy ball
ah I use that as a floorball ball lah then the thing I use use use I play aku practise lah
aku practise practise practise and you know the grip is not nice
floorball stick is softer the grip so ya my hand bengkak
ah I swear aku tak boleh shoot sial aku tak boleh shoot
it will never be a high shot macam shot or low shot gitu so I was so frustrated because the rest could do it
because okay basically kan floorball is macam yang banyak perempuan lawa lawa semua
because they never ajak us ke apa they just let us one side
okay okay tu bagus ah actually
floorball macam collective it's a collective you're in the floorball then you means you're floorball members ah so
then macam okay ah apa set ah then I then I go interview then I like
confirm malam I stay at bedok like jauh kan I was like
that's how I that ah then lah itu lah that's how I ended up in
tapi tak ya I think it's becoming popular because I think we're good at floorball
because I go to I go watch macam tengok tournament itu semua kan some of my friends are in the national team
I don't know like you minah like that eh I don't know why ah I damn scared of you sia
I know okay one thing for sure kau punya idea bagus gila like no joke and some
but that ni but I feel like cause kita tak banyak orang ah tak ah dah tak tak banyak manpower pun ni
points that kind of thing right cause got the apa apa
oh ya okay I feel like itu macam saja macam myth saja it's just to like oh just make you exercise
got music one ah ada music
kau kau join chinese dance is specifically chinese dance saja
bukan ada mix tak
vibing habis sekarang kau tak menari kau tak nak menari kau tak
so sekarang kau macam dance yang K-pop ke apa with your friend ah
eh we should kita mesti dance seh next time
ya but then because I don't know I I'm not good at following macam movement tahu
but kalau free style it's it's no boundaries up to me
but if you had a chance to like like you know like now people do the urban dance get kind of thing maybe like that kind macam gempak pun apa
oh the slow kind ah yang ni macam yang macam you know the ones that the choreography is like
ah kalau hip hop ke gitu okay ah you like you like you
it's that one takes time to appreciate it tak apa tak apa
rugged ah type macam rugged ah
oh tak kisah sangat ah
a bit err just macam sikit ah
then sekarang kau kau nak plan plan pergi university tak
macam mana nak cakap gigs gitu
I need to macam start from the bottom media and not
ya ya ya that's true that's true kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus macam
kau boleh buat banyak benda kau boleh adapt adapt adapt adapt adapt
then kau belajar belajar sekali
but like but that's the thing though I think macam singapore kan dia orang they have like this emphasis on macam
kau mesti bagus at everything but like let's say
architecture okay then you major but nanti they say oh no you have to have good record
now that I think of it last time kan we always macam
oh aku nak jadi orang kaya then when you rethink about it now macam maybe I don't want to be a rich person
under under under under under us lagi you know like this so it's like
ah mata merah
apa bersefahaman eh why is does that sound like a paper kind of
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
oh cannot lah that one is too gila okay maybe I start first
if I got three hajat the first one would be I want to talk to my kucing
cause because I just like like every time I always like talk to my kucing and then I I become like a gila person and I like berbual merepek I legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if I if I can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
but macam fun lah
alamak if macam tu then
but I want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
like kalau I'm given a chance to travel back right I want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya I tak nak apa tu I don't want to travel to the future
cause I takut that if I see macam what my future is
macam I risau lah that my what my actions will
oh ya that's true but okay example lah if if in the future I see that I become doctor and then abeh I I don't know I
okay no no no change change change okay in the future I see that I'm something that I don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then I'll be like oh okay okay ah try to like then I'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like I don't know then it will affect my like what I'm doing right now lah and then macam tak ada thrill if I know that in the end I'll become doctor then
then I'll be demotivated to study cause I know my future like okay lah later I become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
tapi fun lah
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that oh kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup lah tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then I fikir also like betul lah
but if I tidur
sikit sangat also I also ngantuk
ya ya I understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
oh I faham
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh I think I think
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes lah okay not my ayah my ibu
ya I a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah lah
and cut down on the gula-gula
oh wait no maggi goreng
no ada indomie and maggi eh mi sedaap
actually I last time legit suka eh ibumie
ya sedap but then
I don't know why everyone say indomie so I like oh oh okay okay sama sama lah indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
it's like lain sikit
mi sedaap they legit like tak lokek their bawang
but their bawang a bit macam
weird lah cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's I don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
kan maybe it's like bawang but
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
oh I tadi I eat uh briyani
okay lah tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
daging I don't like
what the wait they jual where
I I want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
I feel like pelan-pelan I will I will adapt to it
and like what you know during the time I go up to to to aqil to ask for the gambar
and then imagine I I tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me I'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
actually takde power yang
yang I don't know
is ada hikmahnya that
um ada udang sebalik ini semua
tak pernah eh
I legit tak pernah dengar
apa eh let me think
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik lah if you don't already have it
what is the one okay wait I read in malay also okay sabar sabar eh
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
alasan that is paling like is okay
I can think of one alasan that is very remeh
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah eh tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham kan ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek lah
kan kan macam nak sepak jer kan
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
wah that one I tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
apakah genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent um drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
I think I faham a bit
is it macam
okay it's not really genre lah but okay as you know lah I suka like anime like recently like I watch a lot of anime
like why I like anime is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! I don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu lah but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya lah like anime
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham lah it's like
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the anime their their plot macam very exciting and very fun lah cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
kan macam
eh just ask me I can tolong ask rina also
I added I follow your adik and she legit so funny
oh my god my adik also you know my adik is like like very young
and he type macam legit like budak zaman sekarang like you know you know how you type macam oo whoa whoa
and the thing is he's a lelaki you know so when like sometimes I I tengok they way he type or he hantar me message and I legit sometimes macam a bit disgusted
ya and and his macam ejaan is lain you know like you know when you um eja like no is N O he eja like N U U U U U so it's nuuuuu
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat lah kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
if duit is percuma then
I want mm I want bubble tea to be percuma
then I can rasa I can rasa all the different flavours
because sekarang I just keep buying the brown sugar fresh milk
you know I baru beli the sandals right
and then tadi I keluar lah I went ikea and apa tu it was like a bit scary cause I don't know I don't know why like when I pakai the sandals it feels like like high heels or something
ya ya and I takut it will cabut so I was like I was like trying to macam walk slowly and it looks a bit weird my mother was like eh jalan betul-betul lah
don't know cause apa tu sebelum tu I had uh one pair of rubi shoes and it actually like lasted quite lama lah
ya cause kadang-kadang it's only until forty
that's a bit kesian
oh oh my god I benci when when like they always look at me like I want to curi something
if it's just what like how I'm acting I think I was acting macam biasa jer
tapi legit menyampah
maybe they kena force to do it
actually kan if they if they tak cakap welcome then that means they just diri kat situ and stare at you so maybe that's why they welcome welcome
oh I did I did okay apa ah I actually just bought like baju
and seluar and kasut ah cause like tak ada banyak benda that I need and I
I'm actually cause I look at my wardrobe and like I got so many baju that I don't really pakai all the time
and it's like I simpan it's just cause I simpan cause I sayang you know I don't want to I don't want to buang
then I keep macam telling myself dah tak apa lah next time can use but
I don't actually pakai it lah so so I like
chose some baju that I want to give away and I'm giving away to rina cause she
she tanya lah ya and then but from eleven eleven ah what
I bought two jeans one white one black then I also beli ah two blouse ya one white and then is another blouse and then I also bought skincare which is apa tu ya
ya ya correct and the kasut lah
the hitam one the kasut is actually very nice
I actually nak pergi typo cause I want to buy some stuff from typo

wait you bangun pukul berapa
so actually I bangun pukul I bangun pukul lapan and then I
uh I tried to do stuff until pukul dua belas then pukul dua belas I went out mm I went out to ikea

ya and then I jatuh you know and then I didn't skate anymore
no no no it's the roller blade the apa tu the roda is tajam right but then the skate the skating the indoor skating that we're going is the roda is like roundish and fat
so I a bit takut to go skating
I just tarik all of you down
I I think the the apa tu yang the round wheels right is harder to balance
ya cause like example ah you diri and then if you diri too straight then you can jatuh eh
ya you can jatuh backwards or if you sandar right you can jatuh also that's how I jatuh last time
oh my god I don't even kemas my bilik
I want to beli you know the like the mirror that is like panjang
but I also want to install you know kipas on the wall cause my kipas now is kat lantai
like cause I need to tarik my kipas everywhere cause
I'm panas then sometimes tertrip on the wire over the wire ya and my kipas also tak kuat sangat
cause now our window grille kan like we need to pasang the the mesh if not like our kucing can escape
ya so we want buy the grille that is like tak besar sangat so the kucing can like no need cannot escape lah
and we no need to pasang the mesh cause now like we all the windows got the mesh
ya no no no it's only the top and then the mesh like tangkap all the bulu
ya so we malas to bersihkan so we just change the window
eh when we keluar on the nineteen we should go to fatburgers
fatburgers ya is a apa tu sign
I think huda want to makan fatburger
no but apparently it's sedap
kat ang mo kio ada I think
oh ya kan kan tapi COVID so tak banyak ah
ya ya that time also I go then like a bit kosong and it was ya I think it was a weekend also cause usually banyak orang sampai tak boleh jalan or something ya but it was kosong ah
apa eh jap
you have one child but you have another one percuma oh
huh that's that's a bit gila
actually twins twins a bit fun when you grow up how many anak you want to have
your apa tu parents very cute
I mean they still muda
my my ibu and ayah they kahwin when they were twenty eight
ya and it's actually my my ibu still schooling cause she
she join like madrasah lambat lah and then she want to like continue islamic studies
so like like she like she never even kerja after she kahwin eh after she kahwin pula she never kerja after she like belajar
so after she belajar which is like she finish twenty eight then my ayah already macam apa simpan duit for how many years already so he sponsor everything
he sponsor the majlis the honeymoon all and then they kahwin at twenty eight but then they ambil like four years to get like my abang
so like they got my abang at thirty two
and you know they tunang for how long
they tunang for six years
dekat huh ya usually orang tunang apa dua tahun
eh I want to kahwin someone baik someone baik someone kacak someone
kalau boleh lah tapi tak boleh kan takpe
can ask nabilah nabilah got buat tu before
you want to berhenti here
how cause I very like macam my friends also like I buka ah
continue ah your story curi how how did he get away with that
the audacity adik curi daripada bapa
macam mana you dapat though
I think some kedai like some shop they will ask some shops tak kesah that one best kalau like if your muka then they like ya ambil lah wah
how I cannot I don't know like I got like macam masih you know ya
like I go I my I sprained my ankle then got like headline fracture then I kind of cannot play sports now then like I feel very insecure like you know because the thing is right macam pasal body like when you are like bigger in size but then you you play sports or what but then when you play sports what did I say oh ya then I stop ah cause I fracture then like the thing is like you know when you are bigger in size
and then but then like when you tak buat apa-apa then like they will just keep on attacking you the same you know like just now we talked about all the aunties seventy year old is like what the hell dude but then you like when you have something macam like if you dance dance is also a sport right or play other sports they will like not say or like you can will just skip one or thirty you wanted to say you know like just now we talk about
say something back but then ya makcik makcik sekarang tak tahu like ya they not it's like bukan tegur it's like menyindir then I'm like wow oh really ah your parents like that
especially in front of other relatives tu aku sakit hati betul oh my god correct not even secretly that is oh my god ya
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them nak kereta I mean like ya oh sorry I don't know what I mean I don't understand like
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry ah I quite shocked ah but alhamdulillah at least he got there I mean macam token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just risau then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior macam tukar macam sergeant kau then kalau nak buat benda like he can macam threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can macam move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you nampak the news baru keluar like ah this chinese man
dia freaking like molest budak kecil perempuan and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is macam kalau nak cakap pasal sexual cases like harassment kat singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of para muslim say that like alah but then like maki alah also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism macam dia tak nak apa-apa religion at all kat dalam dia orang country or tak nak individualism kat dalam country dia orang also dia orang tak nak ah tudung semua tak nak which I don't understand because other people from other religion macam nuns tu semua
because they tutup also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya dia kata dia tak suka hijab cause we look scary
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot lah macam aku boleh err macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant dia orang tak kesah but the thing is even if you tak kesah or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need oh really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
ya I think cause of our agama also cause you know nabi muhammad he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot agama and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world kita dalam bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so selesa and comfortable dalam singapore then when you like tak kesah
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and apa lagi like just perangai dia orang ah I'm wanna believe is adolescence but macam bodoh apa like kalau kau tengok balik they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of mak minah scares me ya scare me like dulu dulu is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion ah tapi sekarang macam I see them like throwing maki ah mak kau
mak kau ya is just uncomfortable lah to tengok like the younger generation
is very sedih ya macam kalau cause the thing is um like the older generation tak nak pergi I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we kalau kau tengok the younger generation aku macam err like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
apa dia buat ni ah
honestly I don't even think you are a minah you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they fikir just because then they feel macam
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something ah is not even tegur is like sindir like asal kau I'm like um sorry sally like like you know like asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau I'm like um I'm trying my best you know like the way they tegur is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to jaga hati or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you ungkitkan balik I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context macam apa ni bodoh like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit ah a bit sometimes they a bit too proud ah of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up macam dulu aku kecil-kecil how ah I don't know lah
wow congratulations wow masuk jannah esok but I've met some people that dia orang err like hafal al quran all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I tersinggung sikit sebab I tak boleh hafal but like you know there's no need to
I come after you eh aku baru habis khatam tau kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam like wow and usually is like not saying what ah but is the madrasah kids pun macam gitu ya and then they
eh I don't know cakap bahasa arab aku macam okay thanks oh my god ya oh my god ya is it like sometimes aku like just fikir and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by cemburu or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like macam it just like sakit hati the way they talk to us is like that
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you khatam like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang not even about quran or what like just in life general macam
dia lari empat round you you baru lari dua round then you just say oh I finished eight rounds macam gitu you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang vlogging vlogging tu kan okay
I only have one girl friend that ada lesen motor and she bawa scooter ya comel bodoh and is very is the lah like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that ah
okay sorry I didn't know it's comel at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like hujan a bit difficult though ya mm ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the besar one just like five K starting price
wow dah fikir jauh sister
mm ah inshallah actually study like last month you know COVID COVID the thirty five guest should have went for it lagi murah really I have like some friends and cousins actually only a friend and two cousins
kahwin during so they only invite dua puluh lima orang then the others like online it was like cheap not cheap ah but like compared to what the malays you know malay weddings are so expensive sis you dah save you wanted to get married twenty two
kalau ada jodoh then it will happen
but wow I'm betul-betul cannot believe that you like dah plan I'm like wow cause like bila cakap online like you're eighteen I'm like cool she's still a student too I'm like she's still around that eighteen age wow
wait you ambil berapa course kat mana how much is it ah I heard private course like expensive what did you sit for like apa you belajar
same same industry also um how you cari course like this oh
but I think like your course and dia punya timing betul-betul chun like cause of the pandemic betul-betul cari like orang apa ni like healthcare people ya they cari ya ya so that was the timing was nice but the pandemic no lah
tak nak try hospital like oh okay okay
oh that's a bit leceh
untuk kahwin okay okay sorry sorry
is he oh no not reservist right oh okay okay sorry sorry I mean how old is your that one oh okay okay kat tekong
yeah oh okay is that a lot I have friends that habis satu kotak like one kotak per day like how what the fuck oh wow isn't it like mahal because I have friends also they pokgai pun masih nak beli rokok
ya then kalau tak pinjam I don't understand the
pinjaming the satu batang satu batang thing it's so funny like halfway through class satu batang K minggu depan okay
cause like my family is don't smoke like my parents tak smoke langsung then when I masuk poly then I'm like to me culture shock cause um none of my friends like close friends smoke but poly oh my god everybody whenever you turn somebody is smoking and like
wow aku macam quite shock nampak dia orang as kelakar to me but like to them is a norm but dah biasa is so cute like minggu depan aku bagi kau balik like wow
comel that's legit selling seh I never see the photo legit wow smart smart no ah no lah
oh my god then they tell the anak-anak look down look down lower your gaze tutup mata scary seh oh man ya
I know some girl friends will be like chill sister I do not want your mat tahir
anak siapa tu astaga
same like like rilek-rilek ya ya macam sendu ours apa sia minah-minah ni
then like they refunded to me aku malas nak register balik and then now online registration got registration fee like online fee I think it's like three dollars or four dollars aku macam I don't want lah I gemar cara
but private mahal ya motorbike but actually I learn how to I don't think is illegal cause my family has like houses like in indonesia then we also have family there then sometimes we just ride the motor there like they teach us lah so technically
I can bawa already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who takde lesen then they just bawa motor they just bawa as long as you tak kena tangkap
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends lah like you know they just bawa takde lesen as long as you tak tangkap is okay takut risky
no but you can beli motor tak lesen
can like my friend no err family member that can pay you see my friend um jual his motor to this kid he haven't even get his license
then he dah dah letak nama dia bayar dah dah ambil dah budak tu I don't know if he has his license already lah but at first when he beli takde I don't know how he gonna learn also cause of like circuit breaker last time but at least he is learning now
but ya but don't lah don't it's illegal illegal don't do illegal things you smoke like cold or hot ya I can smell it why honestly bila my friends cakap pasal ni aku tak but they said got the feeling the feeling
they said hot sakit berat berat is it what you say heavier ah
but you know one brand like gudang garam that one like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like bawa ke sekolah and then they spread ah ya like I don't know how they supply dapat like that day budak ni bawa tu macam
you know when they jual it then that thing you know then dia kasi kasi orang I don't know if they beli or what ah but I'm just like very curious macam mana korang dapat ni semua especially when they are underage and then beli
I mean eh that's a huge flex eh you want to like minum bandung I want to drink bandung in bandung like wow I mean if
you had the money like takde feeling there ah makan french fries kat singapore
you want like just keep quiet right and then tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang why is it quiet ah
kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba like ah budak ni tak nak kasi duit mm mm inshallah
kasi surprised kasi us another surprise
tapi feel like banyak though on the other side apa sia budak-budak ni
I mean who doesn't duit tu siapa tak nak though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche semua nak buat like orang cina-cina you know like the youtubers siapa ni I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel lah in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast melayu like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start ah then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know err malay podcast usually talk about agama like a lot of it
I pusing so no lah eh I only ever seen like those ya but that one is like tiga puluh sen like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that one you pass around your friends
lighter kau ada lighter tak lighter aku dah habis ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but aku tak dengar banyak macam success story for melayu that's like wow you know
mm I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya untuk anjing ah I mean that's for them ah that's a niche for them but like aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya community diam jer
kan kan aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan though
no I think like when we send it to them then dia orang akan dengar and I think cause cause the video they show dalam form like changing changing the code switching that one I think they akan belajar to like analyse the way we cakap
interesting ah macam I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit lah how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like campur is usually one one like ya around me lah is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the bahasa ibunda I'm like bro
ya betul betul
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore hijab
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered bak kwa before I'm like 我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren no bak kwa for me no oink oink for me sweetie
but like the err chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if kalau tu bukan apa ni reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
boleh eh

like your whole kampung can stay there
like you can just say hi mak
dekat sebelah like your mother house like literally dekat sebelah but you get your own house
nak ada apa durian rambutan
it's like so besar aiyoyo boleh jadi gila besar dia
is like must be besar lah kalau if it's like macam
kecil I mean like all singapore houses is like so small so kecil
a rumah sebesar
ah betul juga eh ya how come I never thought of that no but then like susah seh kalau macam
staycation tapi staycation masih like around singapore pe
besar ah rumah dia
so it's not made up of kayu you know like last time like they always made up of kayu
you like kayu or you like concrete
you got stay in kayu house before
never ee kentalnya
you know what they call that rumah panggung
that's why like malaysia I don't know eh malaysia like jarang seh
splinter nanti ada splinter then like mak tolong mak ada splinter
mak kau marah sia
north is like uh tempat macam sembawang ah yishun all the atas atas
what is happening there tak ada benda actually okay if you put right uh
okay you think about dia punya benda-benda yang ada dekat sana
nak migrate pergi mana
or to danga bay ya they've got pool you can just go out of the fray a bit I thought they are both right ni
jauh for what
north pun jauh seh
I think the red line super panjang seh dia punya dia punya line macam never ending
you daripada marsiling pergi
after the next stop after marsiling dia macam rasa macam forever dia just tak sampai-sampai macam
nama dia dekat like if you see the listing kan nama dia
tak tahu ha I don't know I don't what is it
oh ya balestier untuk orang kaya tau
untung lah ya man
landed mahal seh landed
wah so expensive seh I really tak sanggup like
kalau nak beli like the four room lah
ya like I would macam spend the
tak tak muai seh
wah like inflation ini semua inflation
empat ratus something empat ratus million juta no I don't think it's billion billion
banyak kan
boleh rent out
I think can make my own kilang
kecoh sia ya
macam oh aku ada kawan kat sana tak ya
tak ya book apa airbnb ke
and then some more you stay at the like two three storey house seram seh
because the currency also lain jadi macam
cost of living kalau if we kalau kita kerja kat sana
err you can also cause kita like we planning to get at woodlands so it's like woodlands area is just so near to then she say so aku kata like you beli rumah dekat woodlands
err you all err rasa macam you all save enough money to beli rumah dekat err
then you all just beli rumah dekat abeh rent out the rumah dekat err singapore ah dekat woodlands
abeh nanti orang cakap like imagine satu rumah like seven hundred dollars
satu rumah eh seven hundred dollars
satu bilik seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
sebab tempat dia kat woodlands
and then after that then you times like let's say the rumah that I want to go for is empat bilik
no dekat singapore ah so seven hundred uh times four
so one month you earn two thousand eight you never even kerja
so like two thousand eight abeh dah tu you convert the money to malaysia
ah tak payah kerja seh
okay so like rumah kan dia ada ninety nine years lease
so kalau freehold that means like you can stay there forever and ever you can go generation
jadi dia macam forever and ever jadi
let's say ada anak cucu cicit
then dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada the rumah
then they can just like rent the rumah then they can just buy another house because it's like
like they have like macam a certain like oh you can only okay if let's say you are a diploma then you can only earn like two five
two five abeh you need to expect to buy a house with the two five
so ya like macam susah seh and you like
apa namanya apa after diploma ah degree
ya after degree abeh setakat macam dapat like a three hundred dollar raise like a starting pay of two eight
why I mean like sedih you know like cause some people like they don't have the money to even pay for a degree
abeh dah tu like you expect like
kita to hustle sama
untuk macam dapat the same
everybody standard like that is the price of the house to the house tapi ni macam
sebab kita punya level is lain
so macam
buat cantik ah resume tu buat cantik cantik swee swee ke
degree is like macam dia punya baru punya in thing tau
ah sabar two five
wow banyak pe
dia boleh pergi mana overseas dia pergi mana
sabar labrador park

dah kata degree
oh shit mahal seh
tunda lah beli rumah tak akan beli
aduh peningnya kepala
tiga puluh ah tiga puluh
tapi tiga puluh lelaki tak ada masalah seh
oh ya ya ya betul betul betul betul
eh but I think like the trend kan sekarang is like
semua orang boleh jadi independent like girl dengan girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it ah and then after that then err kalau macam
nak slack off
so I think the zaman dah berubah change already
now zaman sekarang orang
like perempuan like like girls
the guy's pride the maruah of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's tak boleh avoid
for satu for one person to kerja
macam mana nak cakap macam sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
tapi commission pun tak stable seh
satu hari like you can like satu bulan you can only earn like macam tiga ribu abeh the next bulan you earn lima ribu
lagi like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
then macam wah so difficult that's why like I think susah kalau like you based on like
apa nama dia commission jer
tapi dia buat satu kerja jer pe
so so dia punya pay tetap dua ribu lima ratus atau the pay already
because sekarang dia ambil orang lain punya commission
abeh like
oh no okay so wait her pay dua ribu lima ratus
abeh dah tu kalau sebab sekarang dia ada commission kawan dia so how ever much the commission
of dia punya kawan let's say satu ribu then after that dengan dia punya satu ribu
oh okay okay faham faham
she untung ah
branches cawangan
okay faham faham faham faham
dia tu lah
tak ada hospitalisation leave eh
lagi banyak kerja lah
ah kalau let's say the future

um aku tak gurau ni
mana you need to pandai cari lah you cannot obviously find those yang
apa tu yang what do you call that
you cannot you cannot go to a like a shop itself kalau shop tu ada brand it's definitely going to be expensive you need to buy something yang tak ada brand sebab okay if I tell you um chanel
a bag from chanel or a baju from chanel and a baju from H&M but it's the same exact baju it's the same exact colour however will there be a difference in price
abeh tak nak layan sia aku
wei aku macam nak buatkan rumah untuk coki
and then he like the circle carpet outside if you have saw it and then he also suka bilik mak aku
tahu ah
bilik mak aku a'ah dia dah romantic mood
eh kau ni dah kenapa tengok banyak sangat siao
blackout lah like opaque like eh windows pula astaghfirullahhalazim
ah sebab kau kan vampire
so your house is like just dua tingkat you know you look at my cat
no but then if you open the tingkap near your bilik it wouldn't be a problem right near your room
tapi our air freshener that right there is like an ioniser
tu the white colour thing the ioniser it it basically right it helps you remove all the bad and harmful macam bacterias in the air and then keluarkan the cool air
I cannot understand punya fame you know I realise something weird about me I like like groups that are not famous
he has like wow I know him badan dia like okay it's just something I would like to have you know asal ada benda yang memekak luar kat situ
I'm not saying maisonette is like atas bawah tau rumah dia macam rumah shafiq tu
I mean if you want if you want to have your own house isn't it macam you want your own space
why oh because you just live in your room eh sekarang dah terbiasa gitu lah oh okay okay faham faham
so ah rumah aku ni sebenarnya banyak buku tapi buku-buku ni semua dia untuk perhiasan aku tak baca pun
uh huh atuk aku ada kasih aku buku bila aku P three
cerita dia pasal kampung girl a'ah dia sebenarnya nak kena kahwin dengan siapa lah aku tak tahu
and then it got really complicated aku tak pernah habis baca sebab I find the character so cringey
and it's like macam about love and I'm like awkward reading a love story
but aku rasa kalau aku kasih ulfa she would like it I guess
ah about apa don't get me you know I feel like she has very high standards
macam even the like okay so that day I ask her like
what ah to jaga her atuk and nenek and then she said that her mother is currently working for jems I don't know but I think got out something
like that time ada thing but then in the end she managed to go also pe
ya lah ngok
serious ah asal
ah selalu gitu oh my god girl you want me to get started on christina and ulfa eh no salah nama christina and insha
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them ada boyfriend kan however the thing with insha is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird sebab macam it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
and like macam okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like macam you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay insha did to christina so on like
she she said that macam kalau in terms of apa
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina tapi ya that's not how it is
dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar together they did a double date lepas tu azhari didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why azhari didn't pay for it but then akif paid for it like christina punya boyfriend he paid for insha punya cable car ride

ah aku belum synchronise
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
a maritime in logistics I think there they have actually two course so they have a maritime law and actually and maritime logistic so I'm think I'm having interest in the logistics so macam and I feel that lagi senang ah
ya but it's a more of a countryside punya tempat mm so okay lah there's no distractions I think
actually is a really a good job because like dekat that time intern tempat intern aku bourbon
kau tahu tak admin earn berapa
ya no because I think you see industry mana lah like I feel like kalau kau should search in
maritime punya admin cause they don't go they don't go on board
they just duduk office and just um
friend is admin dekat maritime that time dekat bourbon so she earn two point five but then after after the is ready is one point nine ya correct
under law punya admin
two points seven cause she got a lot of experience no no need you just admin macam registration orang nak masuk
those work that people don't want to do macam filing and stuff
pasal sia
I have still have time to march ah to think about it to I mean to go bank also to minta loan study loon and stuff
like a news so macam like my previous intern might cause I'm still keeping contact them one of the managers kena buang sia
retrenched macam because the economy was busted sia
but ya because aku like from a project I've been working with him so he's the one who actually ya guide me but now they retrench him macam wah
there's a will there's a way betul
also think if tak bising ah
sia satu bilik satu orang
gila kau ya exactly gila kau
cili kering cinnamon stick yang untuk masak serai I think it's hard to find
yes and hard to find lah macam
easy-peasy like cannot find like what blender is already all provided already semua provided yes correct satu kau belikan aku lah sabun lagi
but the cigarette there so expensive oh my goodness rokok sana like the same price as singapore ya
but then my sister macam K like she macam my first sister macam fifty fifty kasi rokok pergi pasal dia kata cause now is very bad like between the muslims and world the trump now sekarang is like the
president of the france kat paris itu like you know dia kata apa like recently dia kata like islam is the region is the problem
so now the key punya president is fighting back
said he will boycott that's why they like he will boycott so my sister say if you go what if you get killed because like my name you know like here I don't wear tudung but it's my name like what if like during the
macam like so like ya so I don't know lah because ya I think they are going to have hopefully not touch wood war soon or something that's why
get kill serious sia you know recent cases kau tak tahu kau tak baca news ya the recent case like I think last week

K the first movie that we watched was apa eh
err oh no yesterday yesterday night semalam yang kita tengok cerita um what was the title
dia macam the oriental express um
what was it eh situ apa ah sebelum the knives out okay jap before that I just wanted to say about the knives out lah okay
it's kinda okay even though err aku tidur lepas tu but I can somehow see that it's a good movie because it actually sedikit banyak macam the oriental express
it's about uh a person being murdered orang kena bunuh and then macam there's a lot but whereas in the oriental express there were twelve people were being suspect and twelve of them were all the murderers that's why the other that's why it was being stabbed twelve times lah kan
but then in this case dalam the oriental err apa the knives out err dia pasal about err dia punya apa this guy umur dia lapan puluh lima tahun eh dia baru sambut dia punya birthday yang lapan puluh lima tahun lepas tu lah dia kena um dia orang assume dia kena bunuh lah
so after that aku tak tahu apa jadi
but you told me that there was satu orang there's a one suspect right ada satu orang kena suspect so ya
this kind of err story apa err story that story line is is good lah I like ah kind of like ya I'm gonna watch it again later
semalam penat babe
um before that what did we watch eh sebelum tu apa kita tengok
you can't have more than one spell ya because aku rasa because one of them err jatuh hati dengan um dia punya apa classmate dia ya
kawan sekolah dia so dia actually dah buat because there's a bully eh actually this guy is a bully so
ya what they did was um dia orang semua spell a cast on him to turn him into good guy and eventually he did lah tapi sayang ya lepas tu yang the one that fall in love with him actually had another err spell cast on him so lepas tu tahu tahu besok dia dah mati
not so super natural sangat juga it still err ya it's true lah
mm tadi apa lagi kita tengok kita tengok oh the nun we watched the nun
aku rasa cerita conjuring is the best horror movie lah
it's it's kind of err thrilling for me memang ah aku pun penakut tapi
lagi pun tengah COVID kan so macam apa lagi cerita kau pergi tengok
for me aku rasa aku punya favourite movie one of it is err mamma mia
my my ah so it's it's a nice movie lah aku addicted to it lah it's very nice lah
annabelle ya dia kena menang ah
I like the one that you showed me yang cerita unhinged tu oh that one you guys have to watch man
banyak emosi you know emosi tertekan leh aduh that's like ya
betul mm
actually aku tak expect ah
and then when and then when it came to a part whereby she started to horn and then you said that okay this is where you will begin okay then I'm like okay I thought he's gonna be like macam stalk her all the way just focusing on her but no she he actually went way beyond and
apa err attacking the family members and all the stuff
wah that's tu seram eh tu kalau kat singapore aku rasa just err
orang tumbuk-menumbuk punya eh
daripada kena road rage
so lepas tu it falls on a saturday and then his wife was supposed to follow him but then the wife actually got invite invitation to err the wife actually is a bake caterer lah
um she was invited to do catering for her event and she's an artist photographer lah begitu so she owns that a big err art gallery eh so lepas tu
err bila dia kata I ah can't follow he she can't follow him to the reunion for this saturday
and then lepas tu uh the guy actually got um connected back with dia punya ex-girlfriend ex-girlfriend back in the college and then the ex-girlfriend also texted him saying that um my husband is not coming then
err I think this guy tak nak ada any connection ah so he just you know
okay I just say this guy A lah eh I forgot the name so this guy A dah pergi dekat reunion dia so he saw his ex-girlfriend
and then it came to a point where the girl the ex-girlfriend actually keep on macam harassing him in a way like kasi uh gambar yang dia tengah pakai sexy lah yang dia tengah apa err ah seducing in a way so two months later
err what what was there sekali dia nampak apa gambar-gambar dia macam nampak gambar familiar kat gallery dia gambar-gambar dia is
all the pictures of him having sex with the ex tapi gambar tak tunjuk
so the picture dia punya face wasn't shown lah so he suspects suspected dia like that maybe this his girlfriend of his is err you know revenging him back tapi tak tahu pasal apa
sampai masanya the woman at the err wife get to know that you know um
so lepas tu dah habis he err the wife somehow got kidnapped
he actually got a try to find for his wife and then he actually stream live dekat dia punya ah social media when he got caught up with dia punya friend bila dia dah kidnap dia punya wife
yang ah this this this district attorney person dia put
sudah dapat tahu and then um
so ya she was she was ni ah she was ah
because he was this close to finding out who actually was behind all this thing and she was pang she was dead
yes so kalau within five minutes dia tak tak bagus tak best
kau lupakan sahaja lah don't try to convince us in watching now
eh tapi ada tapi ada trailer pun doesn't really catch our attention it's like macam ah boring apa
ya ya nasi ambeng
actually it's sedap lah quite quite err nice lah
dia ada consists of uh ayam lemak apa ayam lemak cili padi begedil paru sayur tomato carrot sambal goreng ya it's quite nice lah
so we have been covering ourselves with blankets selimut selimut ya so
so pergi oh yesterday we went to um
where did we go botanical garden but we didn't get to hike banyak sangat pasal hujan hujan dia macam stop lepas tu hujan stop lepas tu adakalanya lepas tu hujan lebat so macam kita tak dapat nak err
habiskan kita punya hiking lah macam selama ni kita habiskan dalam kita will always habiskan dalam ten kilometre twelve kilometres tapi kita tak dapat buat semalam
aku pun macam ya what if lah macam kau tak fikir ke macam kalau komodo tu macam jump dekat kau tiba-tiba ke tahu macam crocodile
macam dia tengah senyap-senyap lepas tu bila lepas tu you know how tall crocodile are right so like macam when they were
it's like macam siala kalau manusia it's like apa
five people tall like that macam gitu ya
and then kita akan dapat news seorang kanak-kanak berumur
dimakan oleh sebuah eh seekor buaya
aku eh aku tak berapa takut sangat lah dengan crocodile semua ah
ah itu lah kalau dia jump kita elak kita elak kita ikut macam P ramlee boleh settle
ramai juga semalam eh yang berumur-berumur jalan-jalan semua
I think pulau ubin not so bad macritchie is like wah kaki aku sakit eh
dia punya jalan dia is so narrow that aku
ya when I went back island wow my leg kasi pain
it's like aku tengah jalan K depan and she was at the back and then there was this noise like you know if monkey were fighting K if you don't know how monkey fight or how it sounds like you go and YouTube it okay so it was a very loud noise and she actually just take her hand and just pull my neck like
a'ah seh it's like boleh gigit engkau sampai cedera parah oh kau tahu tak
monyet business
the older one is like macam
dia macam sign kau ah dia kata jangan bilang dia jangan bilang dia
ah pasal kau dah pekik nama aku
next kalau ada next word coming from your mouth he's going to come at you
takde air because okay that time eh bila aku pergi bali kan then lepas tu they have these tourist place whereby kau boleh beli kau boleh beli banana and it's like the kecil-kecil banana in a bunch
for like two dollars so lepas tu kau boleh feed the banana the banana pulak kau boleh feed
kau boleh feed the monkeys there lah and there were a lot of monkeys there where tapi kat situ ada rangers lah
there's this one monkey aku rasa maybe dia macam hmm primary school monkey
dia tak besar dia tak kecil ah he's not an adult he's not a child so probably maybe it's like err teenager so this monkey actually came to me and then he just snatch this banana from me so lepas tu I think the banana was rotten
so dia buka he peel peel peel peel
I was shocked I was like eh ini biadap eh like I paid because it was so I was so err interested I mean I was so having I was so much having fun
so I kept buying the bananas like up to ten dollars dah so kau imagine ya aku beli two dollar two dollar two dollar so I kept buying and then I buy lepas tu
aku dah kasi kat semua monyet and the monkeys will be like macam dia tak ada datang kat engkau macam simpati punya macam kucing takde eh dia tak nak engkau turun dia jump on you and jump on your head or your body there's like three monkeys four monkeys on me
wanted that banana so I gave it ya gave it gave it gave it then after that satu tonyoh kepala aku okay like after he ate the banana he actually just like
so err aku takut ah aku tak marah lah kalau aku marah dia sekali dia bawa the gang ah mana tahu dia faham bahasa aku so
so bila so that time bila aku tengah jalan-jalan then there's this one ang moh ada this orang putih mat salleh lah dia
I think she was trying to play with the monkey but the rangers suruh kita dah kita masuk kita semua orang masuk dia dah cakap don't try to be funny lah kalau ada
uh grab your banana grab banana lah kalau dia um you know you don't like macam main-main dengan dia lah so aku rasa this orang putih main-main dengan dia so he actually wanted to bite her ears
aku rasa dia angry ah or aggressive ah because dia main-main the rangers tu dah kata jangan main-main so so he actually wanted to bite the ears ah so dah macam just
not really that deep bite lah sort of one bite so the ah the caucasian girl was at shock ah dia pekik and in the ranger was like I think they had this macam
kayu ke apa aku tak tahu ah I don't know what's that lah so he just like macam whack it so that the monkey will go away
aku tak tahu ah that is that is because they are rangers they know their monkeys aiyo
ah tahu tak apa ah nanti dia panggil dia punya gang lagi ah tak payah lah terima kasih sudah
aku rather deal with one monkey than a lot of monkeys
okay maybe ostrich farm is one another one is yang dekat mana eh
I mean they they don't really macam
they don't really macam
um ya malaysia ostrich aku rasa I felt regretful that we didn't get to feed the kangaroo when we were in australia
I have holidays in november and december right so you know I always have this macam
so aku just want to ask like do you prefer to work at home or do you prefer to go to your physical workplace
so ya that's that's that's our life lah eh kita hopefully things get better hopefully things um
okay lah I don't like that you know we take things we take life for granted we thought that you know you could travel as much as we can we could go out as much as we can you know but when this kind of thing happen we will like macam
alamak tak boleh buat tu tak boleh buat ni
we can't get to travel as much we can't um and then when we now we used to have like gathering kita ada gathering we used to like just book chalet and invite you know like what twenty thirty forty people and then birthday celebration
we will invite people over but now is like macam
orang lagi banyak yang hush hush you know coming in to celebrate birthday and all those stuff
aku rasa vendor pun kesian juga lah it's like you know all these err thing macam numbers restricted numbers and all those stuff that is coming from the government right so when pengantin dah buat bayaran for certain for certain pax eh
and then the pengantin okay lah kalau aku pun aku pun rasa macam I just wasted my money you know like few thousand dollars and then now the numbers is like that so and then vendors pun
kesian juga lah like macam aku dia also want to earn a living you see so there was a point whereby there's err apa err miscommunication between the pengantin and vendor like asking for refund and all those stuff like even vendor also didn't know that this thing will happen
and it wasn't even in the contract so some of them that I heard is like blaming the vendor you know of not giving me back tak highlight dengan duit lah you know and those stuff but
aku rasa it's it has it has to be um
communicate both face sekali lah
like pengantin pun tak expect numbers will drop vendor pun tak expect numbers will drop so you know it's only fair that vendor err apa err maybe gantikan dengan something or the pengantin kurangkan something so that you know both will be happy about it lah
ya pasar basah ya
mengeteh lah kopi lah so
I think just old old songs or cerita-cerita lama ya atau pun err they will go to me watch and you know err um buka daripada handphone apps then buka YouTube ah apa
I also err apa tu download err yang apps untuk watch movie ya so wherever he can scroll he scroll ya
ya ya my mum actually downloaded like malaysia punya astro ria those stuff you know lepas tu dia orang tengok ya so
ho ho aku tak kenal

tak tak tahu tak tahu tak tahu siapa dia lah tak tahu dia siapa tapi ini macam kali kedua kita kena buat lagi kan pasal buat salah ah jadi
lepas tu dia tak ada clapping
dia macam err conjuring ah dia main clapping dekat dalam almari macam gitu ah jadi
so dia macam ya dia macam gitu ah sekejap dengar sekejap dia tak dengar so aku tak tahu apa masalahnya masalahnya ke dengan apps ke dengan err recording ke aku tak tahu apa masalah dia lah
dia suruh bual dia suruh bual like daily dia suruh berbual just macam daily macam kita berbual so sekarang ni kita bual macam daily ah macam berbual K jadi aku tak tahu kalau kita terlebih melayu atau pun kita terlebih orang putih aku tak tahu jadi
aku tak tahu aku dah tanya macam mana I justify tapi tak ada jawapan so dia kata bual macam biasa kau bual lah macam biasa sekarang

enam puluh dot dot kosong lima okay
mmhmm jadi okay apa kata-kata terakhir kau sebelum kau
bro you can't even masuk malaysia
buka the border
but when did it even tutup the borders is it recent no eh
but I also scared to masuk malaysia now though like now malaysia tiba-tiba banyak gila case
ya bro like in a day dorang ada macam three hundred cases tau
but it's like macam at area but still like like it's COVID man it's like the virus dia boleh spread cepat-cepat pe no matter where you are
I know like a a week ago or two weeks ago it was like oh uh one case dekat like uh what macam punya yang macam apa sunway lagoon I don't know then tiba-tiba two case seh tiba-tiba like twenty lah blah blah then tiba-tiba in a day like one hundred or two hundred I don't know something like that
basically like spike up like the cases spike up in a day banyak gila
for real so I'm kinda okay that kita tak boleh masuk but the thing is for the past few months it was close like macam asal kita tak boleh masuk tapi ni dia dah spike up balik so I don't know
dorang dah start balik apa dorang punya I don't know like dorang dah start they have to start like staying at home again
I mean I was I was stalking like malaysian punya celebrity then dorang macam yay lagi then I'm like oh really for real that was like four days ago two days ago ada orang post gambar I don't know
I know crazy right bro I literally just only thought like it was a getting better then like tiba-tiba spike up balik
first like okay like alhamdulilah ah like I finger crossed it won't happen to singapore like even though yang korea dapat apa the second wave tapi it's not as much as malaysia tau
ya but it like the cases are not like super macam uh as macam extra like macam banyak gila
ya mana ada time nak
nak stalk syafiq kyle
even though I tak suka pun I akan tengok seh super bored
no I just know that eh I only watch if I know the pelakon or if I like dia berlakon
did you even know there's like dramas like halted dia punya then I was ah before this I also like quarantine different time kat saudi kan so I was also keeping up to this malay drama dia I think episode thirteen pasal because of COVID dorang tak boleh film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
oh my god but aku pun before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama lah K drama malas gila so damn long
no but it's so annoying is like ah no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together macam
iya lah ya lah I know but like I just I cannot no but that one I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that one I like and then the other one uh was when this dude ada breast cancer or something uh ya breast cancer ah
ya cerita lama
um apa like what cerita
that's why I cakap I tak suka tengok K drama cause it's so draggy
six times I swear every time she macam ah I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because kita tak boleh keluar right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime ke or a cartoon macam disney you know those kind of thing oh my god like macam fictional punya movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like macam one hour so attached to freaking marvel punya ah like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever ah bila apa uh uh ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like dia punya macam fake anak macam you know work to spiderman lah other than that like than I was like wah
that makes me macam happy already
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like macam marvel like after ni before I masuk uh I watch end game aku tengok like the whole movie sequence before that
then aku baca just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like macam warmth and comfort knowing that macam whatever at least spiderman ada girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like macam they did like alternate these stories of like that story
I mean the purpose tak semestinya untuk for that but macam mostly people macam when you like something so much like you crave for more what macam if you kau pernah tengok spiderman kan
you know how spiderman uh uh spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right macam peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland sekarang ni is like peter parker and but tak banyak movie of peter parker and what so people make fan fiction of it then kita macam oh my god imagine ah so happy
ya it's okay tapi aku baca fan fiction just like just to make myself happy lah you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
like what korean dramas kau tengok
how about is it that intrigued macam like
tak pernah like tak classy
like everytime hor I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare what like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so macam
no but general in general like if you want to buat like if you want to macam buat the drama tau like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel kau pernah tengok hotel del luna right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot pasal religion that's why
ya cameo then he datang right
oh my god I remember aku tak think of that sia
at the end okay lah it's okay but kalau K dramas usually kalau cameo dia datang just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode jer
and also I've never heard of like macam korean drama buat second season
for real abeh maybe sebab dia macam hospital hospital
of course [lah]
now like it's way even at like this malay station ah some tiga atau sembilan they they showing hotel del luna now you know
oh my god oh my god park seo joon dekat suria
bukan eh I don't know
like dub macam orang lain cakap take over orang melayu is talking like they speaking in melayu
no but dulu-dulu when my nenek watch cerita like macam apa uh you know the channel one
so it's a korean singapore punya channel but dia cuma apa tunjuk like korean show like they dub you in malay so weird
tak suka seh it's so it's so
like so uncomfortable I don't know I don't like watching dub one even anime macam english hmm weird
but ya eww weird nya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any uh subtitle uh the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard macam buat jer lah like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person daripada this uh are actor ke apa entah dia macam oh ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like kau tahu parasite menang uh a few awards kan dekat america
so like uh I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people yang selalu macam dorang tak happy tau sebab a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people pun macam but why though pastu dorang macam cakap lah like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I tengok even I I tengok malay drama I pakai english subtitle tau
like even though I understand what droang cakap I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself
aku tak aku tak kan masuk tau aku kena dia aku kena tengok cakap apa
right I can I watched I I I scared I can see both you know I don't know how to explain is not I see both it's just like I can like if I hold my phone I just like tengok I can see both like I don't know how to explain but like I see both
tak ada ah sebab kadang-kadang okay because ada korean drama for me ah ada korean drama kan I don't know about you ah but from what I see right korean drama kan dorang ada banyak kalau you use the subtitle ah translation kan dorang banyak guna bombastic word tau
ya big word so I was like sometimes I take a few I take a few quite a long time to process tau apa yang dia tengah cakap ni tau
that's why I was like that's why that's why it took me quite awhile that's why I because that's because of that I have to like macam read it slowly ya so that's why macam kadang-kadang termiss apa dia cakap ya so I was like thinking are they actually memang
ya bombastic words atau dorang actually because of the translation then dorang guna big words
but I was like thinking macam if you watch malay drama english drama like I don't think they use very big big words
huh really macam apa seh
singapore punya oh my god malay drama tak boleh sia
paling tak aku tengok anak anak metropolitan that was long ago but I never even keep up I just
I didn't really understand the story I just know that they are like really like macam kids who like have problems that's all
anak metropolitan singapore
after that after that macam dia punya tu what
ya I don't understand seh how to use semua tak tahu
then tak boleh
huh you didn't even masuk like this year or like last year
ya I went like masuk oh my god last year I masuk banyak kali seh pakai pakai train
it was so fast no at first I was so sketchy tau aku macam oh my god mesti like lama mesti like boring and like tired tiring it wasn't even that long cepat gila five minutes jer
for real really the immigration was so fast but I don't know but I went during like macam the june holiday
five minutes I'm not kidding five minutes for my mum I I went many times right so the first time I macam I didn't count but apa but the orang cakap macam five minutes so the next time I came my aunt really taruk timer it was like four minutes and like uh fifty seconds four three ya she really put timer you know
tak tahu it was last year
but kalau woodlands shouldn't like it be like the water wasn't around the water area I don't know but I in the train but you know there's a train from singapore to right
ya it's so fast gila like that time aku pergi um dia ingat puasa lagi pergi situ pastu uh tidur kat sana tau okay pastu the next time I pergi I pergi pastu burger dekat uh pastu balik rumah balik like I didn't sleep at I only went back home because it was that fast
it doesn't even feel like five minutes it's like I was just sitting there nanti macam dah okay
cepat gila kan
even when I took the plane uh they say when I balik right from to singapore it wasn't even thirty minutes you know
but usually how long is it from from singapore to because aku tak pernah you I how many times have you been to I feel like I'm the only person yang tak pernah pergi

the driver okay will like damn I mean it's easy if you naik motor ah but then it's so cool to do that oh my god
I mean but but it doesn't I think people usually who go backpacking they they are going it for like the view mostly that's why they don't mind macam hotel like cheap ke apa ke at least as long as they get the view
pastu gi walk you walk from one country to another
I don't know some people do that you know okay some people do that but I swear people who do that gila I cannot seh
like that like that that uh I don't know for you know dekat malaysia this um this orang dia jalan daripada to like ipoh or something just to just so that they can see their punya anak cause of COVID
ya I heard something like that like the father literally walked from one state to another just to just so that they can see the anak
just the just the thought of it macam you think tak [leh]
okay lah I mean kau nak jalan buat apa ye you can take the bus you know you're not in the dire situation to walk
mak I
have you no but you know eh uh few recent juga I exercise my mum I go walk from here to jurong east is not as bad as me walking in the reservoir you know I swear walking in the reservoir is way worse I walk from here to jurong east to like JEM to go eat it's not even that bad
I'm not kidding it's really not that bad it's really not that bad bro I literally walk from here to jurong lake garden I really walked with my cousin I walked the whole time daripada this belakang ni I walk sampai jurong lake garden I swear I'm not kidding I that was really a few days after I balik you know
from the bus stop pastu pergi masuk situ eh
go jurong lake garden but then my cousin satu macam let's go then I'm like okay I guess
like aku aku ah aku ingat kita orang akan stop dekat you know the you know there's like a macam park or something behind science garden eh science garden pula science centre
no apparently where where was like aku jalan jauh-jauh that was only five kilometres
ya like half what almost to bila I nak masuk jurong lake garden that was only five kilometres
I was walking I was walking from behind here you know the old block yang dah tak ada
that that's how I follow the route follow the route uh with um ikut pergi science centre
sorry lah baru balik kan I don't know my directions yet pergi JEM pun susah
dude for real oh my god I felt so stupid my mak kan you know how you can tembus from JEM to no no from JEM you can tembus to west gate west gate can go to ng teng fong to
my dumb ass literally my mum suruh I pergi nak cari barang tau but then aku confident dah pergi kat JEM dah beli barang kan pastu you know how there is also another there's also another shortcut from JEM to be big box
I don't know why my stupid my stupid brain went to the shortcut tapi how you know it's close cause the big box also close so I went to I went I saw the sign and it was the the shortcut was closed tau and then I'm like
oh alamak tak boleh jalan shortcut ni then my stupid dumb self literally walk like I really keluar I had to like cross I keluar daripada JEM really cross the road go to
do you understand kau faham tak I was thinking of how that shortcut was going to lead me to even though it's actually big box
I know I I took ah you know actually they close the shortcut then my mum macam huh really dorang tak pernah close pun pastu I was like ya ya ya they close pastu then petang we went again and then we went to westgate then I'm like wait and then my mum is like eh buka apa then I'm like gosh I hate myself
I was so confident I pergi aku jalan and then dia cakap tutup then aku jalan lagi then I'm like okay so it's really close that means I have to like walk like so far away to like from JEM to
I never I never look up you know I just masuk and like
I just need to know my ways see I'm just like not used to going out and that's why actually alone pula tu I'm still getting used to the idea I have to go out alone you know
I've never in my entire life I mean ya I mean okay cause it was saudi so I've never because of saudi I tak boleh keluar like no matter how how old or how young you are like if you are a girl usually cannot leave the house alone
they will get asked by the dajjal
protected it's haram right haram
orang yang not that yang
oh so the the ones yang ada faith and yang ada iman yang kuat they will be they will get protected
oh the real like muslim like one yang betul betul like hold faith
you will be strong enough you akan react out which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
no matter how I I think no matter how macam you you even if you pernah experience pun I feel like if it's at that time truly you can never imagine like how you will react unless you for real for real like you can believe in yourself lah like your faith
ya so macam cool seh and australia kan
is it hiroshima yang ada nuclear
is it when you masuk that macam fake rumah then it
like macam what's like apa yang macam
no but I feel like I feel like if uh aku like hopefully not if aku like if ever if there was ever a time where there was an earthquake aku rasa aku akan panic to the point I will not hide under table I will just and then like suddenly everything fall on my head then like
I feel like no matter how much I prepare for something like maybe if it's not enough like I even if I prepare for it like aku aku tak akan when I panic aku tak kan think straight at all
as long as dia boleh protect your head should be fine lah
I mean dia if you you akan obviously kena squish kena squash by the building but as long as you tak kena uh ni apa fracture your head ke apa ke should be okay that's like the most important part what
ya I feel like macam when like when like uh whenever I see macam yang apa earthquake punya macam what's that word macam dia punya aftermath like you know how they find the people in the building semua
the ones alive their their their okay but maybe their kaki yang stuck kat dia punya macam I don't know like a hard apa benda entah
I mean obviously lah earthquake semua ni it's all in god's hand like it can happen anytime whenever it wants to
this COVID jer I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back pun ada the spanish flu which was also like
macam a few decades ago I guess
ya but still macam like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history macam memang tings like this happen like even if it's not common
but it was a big thing in saudi seh in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised aku tak tahu yang SARS is a big thing in middle east
and but I don't think when it happen kat singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
dorang ada vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a macam what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory punya virus
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just orang sakit tiba-tiba
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which aku still tak boleh brain
we have to do an assignment and it was like oh what what do you what what can you write a macam essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self macam like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so gila like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird tak boleh seh
no but then I'm so impressed with the I was I was so shock when I saw like the news I was so impressed that after three months this was like the twenty seventh obviously lah macam I mean it's death like it's not good no matter how much how much or how little like it's not great but compared to other places I'm so impressed that
it's like it's like serious that you have to go to hospital but not as serious you have to go to a like major hospital gitu
like the one day two day stay that dekat hospital that kind of thing
I tak dengar seh I didn't know that
chey I tak tahu seh I thought that was like a centre research centre or something I was like why this hospital is so damn big
so kau nampak yang hospital
how many rumah dorang nak seh there are so many rumah sekarang kat singapore tak apa pun
but then like they now this now slowly right where like for my situation right now like in saudi they do this like apa saudi I don't know lah basically dorang nak kick out semua foreigners and they want to make the their own people work
that's why my dad suruh I pindah balik kat singapore cause he takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang then like I'm in the middle of school then macam tak baik tak tak nice right for me to suddenly like ditch
but I mean alhamdulilah lah maybe rezeki it's better to also
actually dia kerja sana buat apa eh
no no there's this one type I mean I think it depends like sometimes he kerja in the office and then sometimes like there's this banyak kali aku bau dia punya freaking oil like I really hated the smell bro it like petroleum punya smell like it was so in the house and I thought was going to die you know
for real bau dia kuat gila
pakai oil semua kan
bila time kerja
it's not busuk but it's like you think you so chemically eh
like you you bila you smell you macam oh my god I'm gonna die
but that one is like macam refine oil macam dah
got difference it's like raw black oil so maybe pasal tu bau dia macam weird sikit
ya duh that's the thing no the thing is about oh bila bapa aku balik I I can't even see any stain on him you know
you mean so angry at the world or your attendance masalah
eh wait but the thing kan but the thing is kenapa dia nak tanya kita pasal intern bila kita dah habis intern and kita intern sama timing pe and now we schooling again
kenapa eh
is it is it supervisor dia orang lelaki or something like that
plymouth ah K that I heard jadi he can actually do it lah but the thing is the main topic sekarang is kenapa dia selalu awak ah
kenapa bukan saya saya yang single awak yang dah attached pe dia cuma message
tak tapi saya expect
okay saya tak expect apa-apa tapi kenapa dia message awak lebih daripada saya ah I think because awak lebih friendly ke awak lebih friendly looking saya garang sikit
awak kena faham eh badan awak petite biasanya siapa yang petite orang lain akan tengok as macam lebih sopan lebih lembut
percayalah saya saya tahu kita sama height tapi
saya lagi besar awak lagi sempurna okay K let's not talk about this okay tak proper kita boleh tukar topik dia K jadi nak saya bilang apa jadi pada saya dah
K kalau awak notice kan kehidupan saya tetap tenang sahaja
tak banyak complication kerana saya tak berbual sangat dengan orang lain jadi saya tidak ada banyak masalah lagi-lagi
okay ya lah tak kelakar okay jadi lepas tu I
nak message ah cakap thank you terima kasih like I usually do that for every outing like even if kita
I go out with you kan I always say macam thanks for today ke apa semua then
nak message dia nak message dia then suddenly dia nowhere to be seen tak boleh nampak profile picture dia cannot even see his contact profile or whatever
then I ingatkan oh maybe whatsapp glitch ah whatsapp glitch jadi
err tak ah kita dah nampak muka each other kita dah nampak then the thing is
my profile picture were tak catfish ah dia punya profile pic pun sama then the thing is he look so cute why why are the cute guys like this
oh dah okay ya basically every single social media platform and then tak nampak dia lagi and
that time lah eh saya just tahu dia tak suka saya tapi that's okay pasal
dah biasa kan online biasanya dia orang cakap apa ghosts ah ghosts I got ghost stick in my life
tapi tak apa lah ni kehidupan kan manusia what to do it is what it is jadi awak ada calon apa-apa lain tak untuk saya
calon apa ya
ah tapi dia bising lah
tapi tak semestinya dia lagi tua daripada saya dia apa secucuk how do how do you say that in english ah
jauhkan aku dari adik-adik ya that's true
ah okay wait how do you even know him same madrasah or school or
okay faham juga but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
bantah no no no no bantah is you shake right
kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain in a
in a macam manja-manja way of course lah mana boleh gitu kita dah ada boyfriend of course kita kena setia kan jadi macam I prefer kalau dia macam
berbual dengan saya eh you are my girlfriend seh eh janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita happy sama-sama
oh my god wait tak
ah apa ah are you serious
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story kan jadi I was also confused lah apa tengah jadi ni then err girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
and the thing is kan all this time dia baik dengan saya tau dia tak pernah tak senyum pada saya dia selalu macam senyum nanti dia hug kalau nampak saya
muka muka dua ular kepala dua err agaknya ah
dengan pelik seh story gitu yang oh lagi satu saya nak bilang ah
bukan bukan nama saya jer yang dalam story itu kawan-kawan lelaki kawan-kawan lelaki tu yang perempuan dia pun letak nama dia orang sana
lelaki itu bukan gay lelaki tu straight cuma lelaki tu
ada juga kawan perempuan takkan tak ada kawan perempuan kan ya jadi yang ex girlfriend ingatkan dia tipu perempuan tu dengan saya tapi
apa mm mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
saya tak tahu lah saya tak nak cakap apa-apa saya tak nak buka aib dia nanti saya yang kena eh kena jadi saya pun tak cakap apa-apa pasal tu ah saya just diamkan mm
err saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya eh bilang awak tak apa lah nama dia orang semua tapi ni jer lah yang saya boleh bilang awak
yang lelaki tu kawan saya saya saya dah memang tak suka lelaki tu ah
saya cuma ah nampak lelaki tu sebagai kawan baik saya macam abang-abang
tak tak tak dia hanya kawan sahaja dia nampak saya sebagai adik saya nampak dia sebagai abang itu lah kita
punya perhubungan ah kalau faham lah jadi ramai orang pun tahu kita tak suka
a'ah satu sama lain macam kita yes correct we are just platonic friends but a lot of people know that
jadi my supervisor ni melayu you my mentor pula cina lah then kan ni sebelum COVID jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama kan jadi saya yang kena pass
uh all these work to let's say kalau dia cakap kena pass err find me to another person kan err jadi I just do that lah tapi nanti
the person I pass it to semua they tell me that it's wrong I'm not supposed to do that then I have to go back you get that feeling
oh okay but the thing is yang the company itself should also update their tablets or their or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
naik turun bukit you know what let's let's grab this topic completely I want to forget about intern
but most of them still think that we are macam or they have a choice to not choose because I feel like
saya pun confused ah tengok bual-bual pasal apa ni okay tapi tapi saya faham lah saya faham awak kena ah
um okay K saya faham juga melayu kita memang hancur apa yang awak dapat grade untuk secondary ke primary school leh
saya saya dapat B three juga agaknya tapi ah
I do well bilang saya untuk retake kertas tu tapi saya tak bagi pasal uh saya memang tahu saya tak akan ada time untuk belajar untuk bahasa lain atau topic lain
tapi tapi akhirnya tetap fail
awak awak ingat tak yang that time kita tengah
nak cepat-cepat habiskan project sir farhan
then kita tak pergi class kita pergi library
then ah ya ya that one and then uh mister farhan ke miss judy yang pergi library caught all of us dekat sana
ya dia yang tangkap kita semua ah
ya I was there ah saya dekat sana then they nampak saya okay
the thing is kan yang that hari itu tangan sedang berdarah uh
tangan saya berdarah dengan saya tak nak um
lipat saya eh saya tak nak buka sleeves saya jadi ah ku tak nanti baju saya kotor kan kena darah semua
ya jadi saya lipat lah saya punya sleeves then ingat saya cuba potong tangan saya kerana saya sedih ya betul
dia dia ah lepas dia dah marah semua orang dalam library dia panggil saya untuk berbual dengan saya dia dia tanya saya saya okay ke tak lepas tu dengan saya tak tahu kenapa dia
dengan dia punya ketabahan tabah mean apa ya
oh eh okay saya tak tahu perkataan dalam melayu tetapi dia dengan confidencenya dia tanya saya awak sedih kerana awak punya agama tak kasih saya suka perempuan eh tak kasih awak suka perempuan eh
apa lah perempuan ni lepas tu saya cakap tak tak saya saya memang saya saya suka lelaki saya suka saya saya suka perempuan tapi ah ada ada limit dia lah yes

the last straw and then so aku cam
aku ambil jer ah aku just angkat jer ah apa yang telan jer ah aku just telan apa yang
dia dah tu kira
the last straw so aku tengok that was the
so I just thought like okay ah I guess aku kena I have to let go ah and
it's over the healing process lama sia
like gentle sia healing process lama sia tu first nya but
you know most of the time it's not going to be ah most of the time kau boleh cakap ah kebanyakkan tak ada orang akan last sampai
kahwin ke jannah from the first one tau
so itu apa aku cakap
siapa tak nak kan semua orang nak lah banyak benda sia semua orang nak like cuma
as I said ah macam tadi like
kalau benda semua semua benda kau dapat dalam dunia pun buat apa hidup pe
tak kan apa beza dia kalau kau tanya yang tiga wishes
cam satu benda jer
apa link sia
pape free uh makanan ah
tapi aku tak nak siapa tak nak free makan aku suka makan siapa pun suka makan
kalau boleh hari-hari Pizza Hut pun Pizza Hut sia hari-hari
muak ah tapi cam
okay but ya anyways walaupun kau berbual tak ada link
takpe aku continue story aku pasal aku nak berbual aku nya story
aku feel bad I feel bad for feeling this way
pasal aku dah dengan
aku feel bad a little bad
aku rasa cam it's a crime
pasal for feeling this because
I already have a girl right now okay kau faham kan
aku cam this girl was like
the ah let's say aku rasa cam second minggu of my school week
so basically this girl was the second my second date ah so cam I saw her
uh at this eating place kat sekolah
kat sekolah ah uh terus dah gitu uh
ini pun tapi ya aku dah nampak dia actually funny story is uh
apa yang kelakar is macam
actually aku
kawan aku lagi dua kau kenal juga ah ah actually tak penting ah cam siapa but like aku lagi dua kita dah macam
uh kita dah macam tiga-tiga dah nampak like ni perempuan
and then kita semua cam nak ah tiga-tiga nak cam don't mind try ah kita just main-main time tu time tu kita main-main tak kesah pasal pape ah
because ah aku pun macam rasa aku heartless afterwards
a bit lah maybe exaggeration but I don't think maybe a bit lah and then so aku cam main-main ah tak kesah siapa nak next siapa nak
try try jer ah main-main ah pape jadi jadi ah
and then so cam
kita tiga ah dah gitu kita tiga buat bet siapa kalah pergi minta Instagram
perempuan ni ah and then ah one of them lost ah so cam dia kena pergi minta
err dah gitu kita dah minta
tiga-tiga ah err in the end tiga-tiga dapat pe Instagram dah gitu err
dorang tak jadi ah dorang tak jadi try
ke apa dorang just
dorang pun ada sendiri sendiri nya somehow dorang pun
so aku cam ya I found this girl
to be oh first aku cam
for a few days aku tahan aku tengok story orang dia semua macam mana
aku tak plan pun actually nak
ah through dia nya social media jer ah as in aku tak tahu ah camne because aku belum berbual
so cam aku tengok jer ah dia nya social media dia macam mana
dia okay
so aku cam oh dia okay jer actually
because like aku found dia punya stories to be entertaining
kau tahu cam Instagram stories dia
uh cam entertaining
abeh cam kelakar kelakar it's really kelakar even for me you know
dah gitu uh
you know uh I was aku tried to aku go ahead ah and then uh aku tried to her ah and then
oh but I thought I was a little heartless maybe exaggerate ah cam
aku dia and then err
to to say ah love at first sight cam
pun exaggeration ah cam lebih ah tapi cam I like her a lot ah
at one point kan I could say bukan cakap not bad ah aku boleh cakap sempurna sia
dia cam dia cam uh ya ni ni ah ni ah this is the one ah this one I thought like oh
so kita continue so we talk we talk we talk berbual berbual berbual
sometimes we misunderstood each other it's okay because uh benda ni semua normal pe
ah so dah gitu takpe ah then
on that day tak salah aku sejuk
nak mampus ah aku cakap dengan kau sejuk nak mampus tak tahu asal it wasn't dia nak hujan dia sebelum hujan and then
aku pun demam so menambah ah sejuk
bertambah sejuk aku cam apa ni time tu tiba-tiba kita berbual ah on that day it was normal tau semua benda normal
kita berbual cam biasa uh
and then tiba-tiba dia cakap err dia ada benda nak bilang aku
then aku cam huh apa dia aku cam tak fikir buruk ah pasal apa yang nak jadi
so terus dia cakap
yang dia dah tak terus aku tanya ah

ah terus dia bilang ah ah she said that
sama ah sama macam yang first nya macam just tiba
abeh aku macam uh ah what do you mean ah
and then ah dia cakap ah macam
somehow dia nya feelings dah lost ah
abeh macam dia dah lose feelings ah terus
aku cam huh asal seh boleh tiba gitu I thought everything was going good
imperfect ways I saw perfectness ah to me lah I aku nak honest ah like ni I know it's like very
the last relationship I pestered her and then like maybe it's kind of like macam guilt trip sikit ah but
ini I just learnt like okay lah I cannot do anything about it what
itu apa yang penting ah untuk aku like ah apa ni kebahagiaan dia
so kalau dia bahagia aku okay ah
aku cam cakap dengan dia then aku just cakap dengan dia okay ah if that's what you want then I love you enough ah untuk aku I love you I love her enough to let her go ah untuk lepas kan dia
so then aku cam
okay ah apa ni
the day uh apa eh
so aku just cakap ah I just give her a long note I said err all the best in life ah kalau dia perlu kan pape I will still be here you know I'll still be a friend if you want to consider me that you know ah whatever it is know I've always care for you
aku just cam
so aku just accepted how it was and how it is
and aku just wanted her to be happy
talk time and time ah again we don't talk everyday so untuk kau okay tak to be aku tanya kau dulu untuk kau okay tak kalau
kau kawan dengan ex kau
untuk kau okay kalau kau kawan dengan ex kau
okay aku faham ah but
okay so kita jadi kawan ah
and then like time and time I ask about her because I still care about her you know I always care you know to me untuk aku in my own
yang ni apa aku nak cakap ah so like
aku cam okay ah takpe as in I I mean lah I was already accepting it ah as it is I just want her to be happy ah kan ada

in the end I I still keep gaining and gaining and gaining masih lah aku punya goals tak capai capai
ya but I want back that body right but okay it's okay reda jer kan apa nak buat
kau kau happy
aku pun happy macam gitu ah
aku aku pun dah malas ah nak jaga jaga sangat
kalau jaga jaga jaga tetap lapar juga so
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here jadi kalau you like told off what if sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup then like kita dah jauh perjalanan kan telah tutup so like
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I ada orang suka bunuh very curious about bunuh ah and then I also like to tengok pokok
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window eh hari ini ada pokok this colour eh hari ini ada salji eh hari ini ada and then like tapi kadang-kadang I fikir macam like
eh then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting ah like err summer panas so like the material lain and then winter sejuk and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about orh the money
and then also like the rumah like
um we have to have heated floors ke heated jamban atau katil ke
lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil kan bila kita tidur like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about oh so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
so untuk saya untuk saya ya untuk for me right I want to bring them to
flower species and then can can exist all in one place habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada four seasons every country not ah countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since kita takde four seasons kita boleh lah kita pergi gardens by the bay kan to look at the different flowers and also different uh month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
family is it poor family happy family ah sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like wow so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like err last time it was easy to get right tapi sekarang macam like
mana eh nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda modern so macam I pun fikir lah like wah how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also macam not so complicated and then also about games
um nanti kalau like if you bring tourists over to play games kalau kita tak berbual the same bahasa pun takpe because you know you just gitu gitu gini gini then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed lah I also like reality uh so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like wow so this can happen in real life ah then like because like macam I'm quite curious lah on like
people story tapi takkan macam I nak keluar habis tanya orang eh jadi macam mana you punya life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people punya
jalan hidup without being so kaypoh about it
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like tengok dia orang macam like kitchen nightmare dia punya
ah chef of the restaurant then dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak gordon ramsay pun bantu dia punya restaurant kasi betul this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so macam err
naive and like oh or tapi uh
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so macam senang nak percaya and then tapi like when I watch this also I can feel sad lah because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and macam they cannot dapat that connection dalam real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing macam have you experienced something like that or like
for me my favourite movie banyak juga lah tapi macam ada satu jadi ada satu movie ni yang I suka
macam my kat my handphone kat tepi jadi I tengah buka my computer jadi tangan tu I took out a keyboard my kepala facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
tengok I tu tengah macam ah bekerja ni eh tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata I tu tengah tengok bollywood kat tepi tu
and like cerita bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
I think uh also the thing about watching this uh a lot of times with different people right it makes me uh find out more about err the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan ah then dia orang akan pick up different things that you didn't see
picked up in this movie so I think macam gitu it's quite cool to like tengok err with lain orang ah to see macam dia orang punya perspective tu semua ya and then like um
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like uh this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like wah damn cool leh macam macam and then like
mm I pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini so it's actually dari sana lah tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive lah it's like
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also macam quite interesting
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually bila I dengar soundtrack
sometimes when I watch movies also lepas saya tengok movie tu I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know uh how the song sound like all that ya what what
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes kerana saya seorang yang tamak
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace jadi pasal err
lebih ramai lah jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati blah blah blah and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like masuk dalam and I pakai baju and I tengok cantik ke tak eh and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park wow I don't have to queue eh
do wanna be invisible because macam quite
uh apa ni freeing lah ya freeing then err nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so kan I can beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa I kan pasal tak nampak pun ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni mahal lah satu tahun lima puluh ribu so you imagine kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu uh
err ribu puluh ribu kali tiga it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
yang tu caranya a lot of money so then and then uh I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like uh I remember uh
saudara where they had to lay antara dapat duit bursary atau budak tu move on to a better education so kalau budak tu dapat duit bursary maknanya dia kena stay in
uh not so not the best education untuk dia and then if that that budak goes on to uh a better education he might not get
uh the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education macam it helps to break poverty cycles lah
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they ah have to choose between these two and both are important right ah yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran ya oh ya another thing actually very important uh
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay kita pergi dia punya uh apa ni petrol station nak pergi toilet nak pergi toilet tak kat ah
ah petrol station dia nampak tak dia punya jamban so many different
okay so my friends and I kita selalu berbual how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies tapi kita tetap couldn't kerja because kita perlukan duit right
oh ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right macam people ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening err she has made a lot of friends eh from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya
eh awak sini berkebun eh then they ask her eh can I join or not like
for me my hobbies has always been arts lah I really like arts whether it's like macam music atau
makeup eye makeup lukis ke apa kan it's very fun and like uh I think about hobbies
see like uh what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right jadi apa you punya favourite lagu eh
apa-apa genre lah
kalau lagu melayu kan lagu melayu I ingat macam more
to bahasa indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff lah I think my bahasa indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia kan macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam memory lah dia nak simpan memory tu dia tak nak lupakan uh actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs lah and it's also by an artist that I really like uh actually last year the dia ada datang singer last year maybe last year atau dua tahun lepas dia datang singapore tapi I tak tak pergi alamak
what about like live music err pernah ada pergi tak dengan experience ke tak live music
concert yang macam paling memorable tu dengan my sister juga ah ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok coldplay oh actually an interesting thing about this was uh
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right jadi dia orang nak jual at
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable lah tapi dia punya bila part beli tiket itu pun memorable but in a sedih punya memory ya
oh ya I mm what about macam mm ni punya fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then pasal
setiap orang kan ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you uh ya do you believe in love at first sight
apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik eh
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this ciri-ciri jadi I suka orang ni lah
pelik ya
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish mm how can I don't know about dish lah but I think right for I kan you know my mesti I pilih okay antara syrup limau atau teh O ais limau
ya I think uh like teh O ice also I mean you can minum panas it stays great and then you can minum sejuk it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu lah mungkin ada tapi I tak tahu ya and oh so um
err apa ni kat airport tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan my makan tengah hari pun
sikit jer I think maybe just err what do they eat japchae ah japchae I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate japchae japchae is noodle ya ya
very big ah so I if I were to reach there I calculate lah like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the kedai tutup then mesti lapar kan so I remember I I I only bought kacang
habis tu I only ate in taiwan
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax jadi bila I nampak pokok I nampak
uh air air tenteram I tak fikir banyak I boleh dengar
I boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau jer but like there's so many different colours of green
ya like macam bunga-bunga pun
cantik very delicate
and then everybody macam just bersenam dalam dia punya taman
no lah why dia tak marah lah tak tak lama pun kita tunggu like just maybe I think kita sampai about
I think two fifteen then we also understand that it was raining then I also tak kasi you the address right I forgot I didn't give you the address
no I'm sorry I tak kasi you the address
eh you ada assignment is it
then suruh jer lah dia teman you lunch ah
so now he's still marah
then jumpa lah dia accompany you belajar like go to err Starbucks or something
ya I like to go Starbucks dekat buona vista you know that Starbucks
cause tadi tadi we went to do the simulator
ah the simulator is very fast I think around macam twenty minutes gitu
ya it's it's damn stupid the simulator is damn bodoh like you ugh you should go for the simulator it's so it's such a waste of time they just wanna take your money that's all
ya but I think this sekarang two B nak kena ambil simulator kan
then oh then the apa</malay>[ah] time simulator tu they there was one part uh we were riding kononnya under the influence of alcohol
ah ya so stupid so dia nya screen dia macam
ya like fuzzy but still tiba-tiba the car on the right swerve into our lane then become our fault they say oh this is what happens when you driving under err influence of alcohol you cannot predict err accident
ya ya that's why suddenly you know the car swerve into our into our lane then I got I got a macam flashback of my accident that time yang time chinese new year
orh the parents asyik suruh kita balik like oh ah kita masakkan ni kita masakkan tu then kau balik lah makan kalau kau tak nak balik then kita tak buat kan you know that kind of thing
then you will rasa like feel bad what
I macam tak nak go home for dinner
oh my god hari-hari I makan benda sama babe kat rumah like it's always ah ada telur ada ikan ada prawn and it's like that every single
simon suka apa
my mum's today because every week week then we balik sana right so sometimes dia makan sana then I balik I tak makan
like balik bishan then I tak makan then macam I feel bad lah cause
ya then simon also kadang don't eat at my parent's but most of the time he will come home and eat at my place then he will balik and then he will eat again so that's why he become fat already
ada exam soon is it
four modules ya four modules is quite heavy though considering you ada full time job and
he he tak he's not studying right he's just working kan
oh so he expects macam the same the same thing lah
oh gitu but lain what
is baru tujuh minit seh
ya I think dalam tujuh tujuh minit gitu
mmhmm tapi kita hang out kita berbual pasal you know like tu
I mean I'll okay jer kalau nak berbual pasal you know
then sekolah is like um two point five years
anything happens and then I ada sekolah or then I also nak cari kerja what
ya I already like send out resumes and stuff tapi most tak get back
I apply for macam dental assistant like reception slash dental assistant and then there's also uh patient service associate
apa lagi I apply for reception uh
because I tak nak clashed dengan simon punya if I wanted like a shift job I dah police lah like what I wanted to do right
tapi ya like so far tak get back
ya no he's is err office hour paling lambat pun maybe around seven or kadang-kadang he on course night training then he will come home late lah but it's never
macam eat into the weekends unless uh on course or he ada duty ah then those are the times when it will eat into his weekends
ya and then plus apa
like shift job tak kesah apa like ke tak ke like you still need to go and work what
oh yes yes yes yes dia ada it's like morning but it's split into two right I remember you
I very macam um quite err
pressured lah cause like kadang-kadang the kakak will ask me
ah kau tak nak cari kerja ke as in not not directly macam kau tak nak cari kerja but more like um kau nak buat apa sekarang like oh uh kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah like you know this kind of thing then I I've I rasa macam a bit pressured lah it's not macam I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I kalau I pergi balik pun I tak nak jadi manager anymore lah it's very it was very shitty
and then sekarang pun they already increase um part-time punya pay to I think eight
ya I know right then dorang increase I lupa lah I punya pay berapa but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
sebab I can send simon to work
and then I boleh pergi kerja dari sana because he cannot ride to work mah
ya then only during this course yang they kasi him ride his bike tapi he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
err tak tahu eh he cakap nak naik bus tapi naik bus is very very far for him
ya is jauh gila
ya then cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah your
kita kat sana kita tinggal kat hall seh babe kat tilam and then for five days you wanna
like kita ada our own macam room at bishan and then macam I I don't feel comfortable lah kalau macam everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then macam no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want lah like I don't mind to macam pagi-pagi you ambil I punya bike you pergi sungei gedong then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay lah for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he punya reporting time is pukul like tujuh sometime enam setengah then pukul berapa nak keluar rumah you know
sungei gedong you tahu um kubur sana
like pusaraman
ya lim chu kang but lagi dalam
ah my house is very near to his workplace tapi takkan I nak duduk sana lima hari kan
oh my god no dia takkan kasi punya girl
she won't lah dia tak kasi punya lah dia tak kasi lah my sister is damn difficult to talk to she won't even have a conversation with me about her school
ya and then uh he cakap um nak kena tunggu dia habis tour dia baru
err he will maybe pergi nee soon camp then it will be closer to his workplace already eh I mean his house tapi
ya mandai but it's lagi lama lah lagi maybe around one year one point five years
cause dorang tak kasi ride bike right abeh macam orang regular seh ya exactly the dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi the naik motor like everyone in dia punya
uh what do they call name battalion I guess err tak boleh naik motor you can only naik public transport atau you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I belum kerja seh kita belum apply rumah belum kerja then you nak talk about having a car
a'ah I think you you you nak kena fikir about it's not just about petrol tau about like dia punya season parking berapa dia punya road tax berapa
ya that's why dia punya season parking dia punya ah apa what's that called ah road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like ah
I don't know I tak tahu apa is going on in his head that he thinks
ya macam I find tak
makes sense lah if you nak if you nak apa ni ah restrict from uh riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik bus
tak boleh because this thing is not um macam baru baru jer they say oh you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this macam they don't want to change it lah
ya it's damn kesian ah I see
then after that dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik bus jauh sia babe even I nak balik rumah I'd rather take my motorbike go home to choa chu kang apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja
dah lah satu bus jer pergi sana abeh it's also together with like the
ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
they dah lah tak cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
mm mm ya you're not really affected by macam
like the economy but I mean affected a bit lah it's not like you retrenched lah macam bonus dia tak dapat for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant kan tak dapat
err dia kena retrenched
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit macam
macam it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
tapi tak tak confirmed juga apa kalau we masih hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three
oh ya ya ya tapi
hais just I I I macam nak cancel the malay wedding honestly ah tak kesah also to like ah don't have the malay wedding
no I serious I tak kesah pun not to have the malay wedding sebab
leceh sia babe like already kahwin sia like it's no point I don't see a point in having a malay wedding anymore
but I already nikah macam tak tak perlu sia
just tak perlu lah babe serious I dah nikah abeh lepas tu um
ya I tahu I cakap that you know I have a baby next year but you know you never know when you have a baby and then kalau I let's say eh around maybe uh next month or what by december perut I dah besar babe like macam mana nak naik pelamin then kalau in that case I betul-betul pregnant by the time I nak ada a majlis
I punya perut dah besar then I nak kena tunggu I beranak dulu
I dah beranak I nak kena tunggu lagi I punya confinement nak kena settle down my my child and then bila nak ada the wedding tak perlu
I nak pergi nak suruh tolong
I pergi sengkang punya
I nak pergi lah nak appeal lah suruh dorang return I punya deposit lah sebab um dorang tak kasi I punya deposit balik
oh my god I punya I punya catering did I tell you about it
I punya catering oh my god was so freaking difficult they were so difficult with me
so at that point in time boleh ada uh majlis kan
so I punya invitation is two three hundred
so uh that time government kasi sampai two hundred and fifty so you can still have a wedding and everything
ah so I cakap dengan dorang lah ah err okay I still nak go on with the wedding ah tapi invitation two hundred fifty and I tak minta balik I punya duit cause I paid for three hundred pax right so I tak minta balik the fifty that um I paid for tapi I nak you
um macam
err so I I just say that lah then dorang cakap uh they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay boleh kita boleh err have the wedding tapi all the social distancing shit ah you settle
ya so ambil temperature semua you settle
mana boleh gitu sia babe
ya and then apa ni I paying you extra tau then after that dia cakap ah
ya dia punya contract basically saying kalau betul you punya wedding ada um COVID case ah you kena handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then dia cakap um
kita still akan cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to ah I'm still gonna give you what uh you paid for tapi everything else kau settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
tak lah I tak go on ah then after that uh they I think dorang tak rugi sebab that time kan tutup
then dorang tak boleh beli their barang from there what so they have to buy it from singapore what
and then after that I cakap dengan dorang lah I give like kata putus like that I say um
kalau sampai end of the year ah I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money sebab if you think about it eh duit yang I down dengan dorang belum pakai tau
like you all tak beli barang basah
like basically you all tak tak tak pakai ah duit tu
then the the basically you didn't spend ah my money I'm just paying for the instalment nasib baik I tak pay full ah dorang
so dorang punya dorang punya
I don't know sebab I dah bayar up until the last payment so that one is the after after wedding
because the payment pasal dah nak dah nak my wedding seh masa tu
ya I bayar I think err
cause three payments only I make three payments then the last payment is like after the majlis itself lah
ya so I dah bayar dorang
photographer yang dah bayar I still ada mak andam yang dah bayar
um for malay wedding ya that's all kompang I dah bayar as in like I already deposit lah
so I think maybe if if I tak pergi and tulis I punya deposit maybe almost eight K
ya ya exactly like no service is delivered how can you say macam they suffered losses like what losses there was nothing delivered
macam I tak touch anything I tak touch anything at all then how what what losses are you talking about when you didn't deliver anything there was no services delivered I didn't get any product

I mean if aqil is uh willing to work towards that I don't think it'll be much of an issue ah like he yang willingly nak try for try to do it you know instead of err dia buat macam gini sebab your parents macam suruh or dia buat macam gini just to impress your parents I think macam this kind of thing at the end of the day I guess it will affect you

boleh lah boleh lah takleh gi dah
buat crochet jer kan tapi aku macam nak try
benda other than just macam bag pasal aku nak jual a few bags
tapi macam I want to try cardigan lah skirt
tapi aku takut because I need like macam time to try it out
macam model it out you know takut dia macam for sizes and all so
to macam
advise me on the sizing and then macam so what kind of design people is interested in
cause I don't have like banyak content cuma aku aku post apa yang aku ada dulu
tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya self bukannya orang beli then macam
sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku jer I don't know how to macam reach out to
because you know Instagram ada yang promote punya function tapi kena bayar aku tak ada duit dah lah aku tak
uh hobby punya expenses kan so ya
but tak ada duit so what's the things yang kau nak try
aku start pasal aku ada duit kan so aku the first step I did was aku beli mesin
that step I felt very macam alamak abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli ruler
but I I still have not macam masuk class atau macam any course yang will teach me
professional way ya so I think itu pun aku nak kena belajar so kalau if you want to join me
I think we can always join yang macam you know the SkillsFuture kind of thing
yang I saw at Instagram the one that you I send you that time then you were like uh but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
aku nak join the highest level the terus buat baju kurung that one you know
yang that time I was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
I think that one also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like macam after school uh part time I think we can join that
I mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents punya
ya aku pun rasa sama I think that's why I started my shop because I've been following so many macam kedai dorang semua sama like I don't know what I think I there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon ah they hyping all these kedai too much no offence
I saw one kedai dorang jual tote bag like
like basic gila tote bag dia abeh ada macam embroidery macam
macam pathetic ah to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out I'm like oh my god like I can do so much better
and some more kita kan daripada artistic punya course
ya that's why that's why um apa ni
that's why because because dekat Instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always kita selalu macam bilang you are artist you you gonna charge
punya harga mahal it's a piece of art it's a service people not tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu pe
so just charge lebih jangan jangan cause some more kalau kau charge low nanti other artist kena macam compare macam then the customer macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila
ya that one satu lah itu betul
apa ni benda-benda simple gitu
okay lah like I I guess rezeki dorang lah you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine atau machine just help you stitch atau
is it tulis letter punya atau
mm mm pasal my brother dia selalu buat commission work
so orang yang order dia punya commission work is like kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia
tapi dia pergi charge murah seh like A four
oil paint eh not oil acrylic punya paint they charge twenty dua puluh dua puluh dolar jer hello I'm
untuk dia senang lah memang untuk dia senang dia dia draw satu kali satu malam pun dah habis
so dia cakap tak akan aku nak charge mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap
benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang there's people out there yang charge benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau just macam
aku agaknya tak confident lah eh macam insecure macam aku nak jual tote bag aku berapa
macam mahal sangat kawan that kind of thinking you know
but ya so I think kita people like us kalau nak
buat benda-benda gini we should just do because we I don't think we have like necessary knowledge in macam style no offence
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing macam no offence like
like Instagram shops now locals semua macam they all have the same style
scrunchie ada banyak kedai scrunchie
pasal scrunchie senang nak buat
just uh just kain straight abeh kau tahu getah abeh jadi scrunchie ya
boleh lah
tak professional
but I like how macam sekarang punya Instagram shop is like a baru punya like a new platform to jual and you don't have to take rent right itu satu
macam kedai physical kedai ah tapi dorang pun aku follow a few kedai yang buat baju
so kau kau beli dia jahit dia tak jahit dia tak stock up
so kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu you can
baju ya I think that's very important
satu kali ni aku nak tidur abeh aku teringat eh I can't believe people throw around that that that term free size
apa kejadah tu free size
how can anybody have the same baju badan like kalau macam aku dengan kau kita bukannya
size jauh sangat tapi kau kan tinggi sikit
M S S tu pun macam okay at least you got like a few even though is like usually just S M and L
ya what about all those people yang tu macam kecil sangat atau besar sangat dorang kena dorang kena macam
apa ni grief give up sacrifice their style just for their size like very sad
which is like lagi mahal lah
ah tu pasal
lagipun sekarang macam kita our world or our like I don't know maybe people around us or my generation kan
kita more to macam a sustainable lifestyle
so banyak orang choose to beli
local atau secondhand atau thrift tapi
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand atau hand me down dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju kan kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal
itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam smaller than people so kalau banyak orang yang macam
besar sikit then macam mana dorang nak like
sustainable dorang nak macam oh macam long don't buy from fast fashion tapi actually fast fashion pun baju semua kecil lah tapi
ya that's why aku suka sangat dengan this new macam trend of kedai Instagram yang buat
custom fit is I think is very important I think kalau aku boleh jahit I think that's one of my goal macam
I like it's always at the back of my head to buka kedai baju lah actually tapi just I don't have the necessary
skill tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak seh aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai like yes
like yes the baju really is your baju it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your apa
your apa ni
and like lagipun baju yang tailor is always last longer
tahun pasal kan ada tag ada nombor tau and nombor dia belum nombor singapore yang
modern punya you know macam nine tu ya number dia lima or something like that how old is that ya
pasal pasal um
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting kan thrift is macam cheap murah
so kalau kau sustainable is when you buy something that already exists tapi macam at the same time
ah so you don't have to buat benda baru so it's not wasteful lah kirakan tapi kalau vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is mahal hundred dollars for a T-shirt for people apa seh T-shirt one hundred dollar tapi macam is
it got it got apa ni is valuable is got context ah there there's a history to it
uh uh abeh yang thrifting ni secondhand murah macam kat lucky plaza pasal is
people tak nak I feel like value a a a object is based on the
people nak ke tak nak is demand versus supply lah that's what makes the price
so ya I think kalau orang confuse I think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price kalau two dollar that's not vintage macam
oh ya lagipun
benda yang kita kena tanya ni actually kenapa baju sekarang murah
what makes it so like orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah
cause there's actually a cause behind that murah you know
until very sad that's why aku macam sekarang aku dah hundred percent
uh prevent myself daripada beli baju dari Uniqlo Cotton On
ya actually aku tak beli baju baru lah actually pasal
actually no offence tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju and baju kau semua lawa semua my size like I want to give people like I want to macam kasi kasi tapi alamak lawa pula pakai lah
abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar family aku dorang semua pakai baju kau sia
you give me I I wish orang lain pun ada this kind of macam relationship with friends atau macam macam
nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung kan dia orang kampung boleh gather baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil
dia kasi aku so aku selalu ada these people around me yang akan kasi baju but then I I don't think other people
so got a lot of people cause I some sometimes I ada orang tanya aku pasal this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get baju yang macam
bukan fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion tapi actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad tapi susah lah kan tapi ya I also don't have macam
much to say other than macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau tu jer
ye pasal kan actually kalau kau fikir fikir balik kan all this um wasteful punya life
cepat sangat is like so fast like it's sudden
macam actually kita yang boleh nampak lah the drastic changes actually dulu-dulu
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish lelaki dia nak create plastic bag pastu dia nak
dia nak he wants it to be a more sustainable uh alternative tau
dia tak nak pakai tree dia tak nak pakai paper bag pasal is from trees
abeh dia tak nak pakai macam cloth bag because it's uh to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is macam oh macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang
kita salah guna lah kita ada convenience kita buang after every use which is
crazy to me disposable how can satu benda kau buat susah-susah
terus kau buang plastic bag macam factory kena
lagi kalau kau belajar chemistry you know how all this thing is created daripada element dorang semua
kalau if you really look from the root kan kau macam oh my god I can't believe I throw that after one use you know
so going back to yang cakap pasal kedai Instagram and orang sekarang banyak buat benda
the uh it's a like bagus yang orang sekarang uh try their best untuk belajar all these skills balik buat apa ni
just buat benda-benda simple lah tapi at least dorang ada apa
ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini once you buat you akan
hargai you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
once you because we are so jauh daripada the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people kita tak
tak macam eh a'ah eh macam mana macam sayur sayur orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang
it's actually not our fault lah it's just how time has changed abeh macam tapi alhamdulilah kita dapat this
ilham this know in our head that we get to apa ni
belajar lah just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
we we can lagipun kita bukannya sustainably more aware jer I think we just more aware of everything
satu satu pending belum bayar
agaknya lah
is it lagi mahal dorang akan
macam kat mana-mana advertisement tu or what
explore page nanti ada keluar kan
explore page ada macam yang fashion
shopping all that tu kan
pasal actually ada satu dua orang tanya macam berapa gitu tapi dorang overseas then
actually I can I can ship overseas tapi dorang macam oh okay thank you pasal I I think they prefer to buy local lah obviously leceh kan
cause actually crochet kat singapore ada a few kedai crochet kat singapore you know the farah lola that one
ya that one but then it's like to me I don't really like singapore punya crochet punya
design design wise they more like for public friendly eh macam colour dorang macam
black grey tapi crochet it's still crochet but it's just like not as like my style lah
ya it's not like quirky ya pasal kat banyak seh kedai
macam banyak gila and it's all so cute and I like most of it I like inspired from from dorang ah
aku tengok dorang that's why aku nak macam I think that's a good thing about social media kau tengok alamak what am I doing so kau pun
lagipun kedai tu dia actually she used to work at kedai kain pastu pandemic kedai tu tutup
so dia selalu bawa balik kain yang dorang tak nak tau just scrap it's it's kirakan scrap tapi banyak lah
so dia bawa balik abeh dia collect over time abeh waktu pandemic ni dia jahit
dia jahit bag just simple bag it's all shoulder bag
lagipun dia dia baru graduate daripada university of textile or something like that ah
so I like her rezeki like so good lah pasal dia start baru waktu tu yang quarantine tu
abeh banyak orang beli habis tu sekarang all of her kain is dead stock
you know dead stock kain like no more like it's just orang tak nak macam she's already
her lining all recycled uh ah not recycled apa ni
cute she make it cute lah then the kain not that cute tapi she make it cute
abeh sekarang dia ada lagi satu size kau nampak
size dia panjang sikit sling dia abeh it's like big
ya alamak I think one day aku beli ah
tapi susah nak order tu dia drop terus kau kena order
pasal dia punya collection dia tak akan buat balik pe dia satu kali jer
aku pun nak buat gitu tapi kalau buat gitu then aku kena constantly come up with new things
kau tahu tak tapi kalau orang nak yang itu aku macam ah okay lah aku buatkan kau pasal I obviously I want money right
aku cuma buat aku tak tahu apa plan for my
aku pun nak buat gitu but then
aku punya followers tak banyak sekarang so
tu lah actually kau tahu farah lola kan dia punya design satu jer
cuma colour lain
so like everytime dia nak buat kan they just buat that thing and it's like how to say ah
design dia satu jer so kalau imagine
and she will drop that thing she will drop and say okay hari ni aku jual hari ni korang boleh pre-order
order that ah senang kalau kau punya design satu jer
so you can keep doing that same design so you can stock up lah kirakan aku nak made to order actually if can that's why it's a bit
so like that's why ya aku hundred percent will like
I don't know how long it can last tapi macam kalau ada kain it will be more durable
it will be more durable tapi kalau cardigan kan there's not much weight to it kau taruk kat badan kau pe tapi kalau bag kau letak botol
taruk botol tapi it will stretch ah eventually no matter how tight I make it you know
ya then macam quite fun lah because aku follow a few crochet punya kedai and they all so supportive they always share story of the design they like
then got this one kedai she daripada philippine then she say oh uh
uh reply this if you are kedai then I will promote what um the my my best the the my favourite post of you abeh since aku buat tu dia dia
post kat dia punya story abeh like a few crochet philippine punya account also quite cute ya
just happy to see orang singapore
creative so kita
ya even tengok orang pakai baju pun sedih I mean like bukan baju lawa tapi then macam err selipar pakai seluar pendek
tak boleh aku pet peeve ah
knit ke knit
kawan aku buat accounting punya course
sorry maths aku
kau interested dengan benda ni
actually aku nampak banyak job posting dekat job street about
ya I think kalau kau join kerja sekarang with that related job I think kau boleh start dari sana
like you don't have you don't really have to study like ya an alternative lah lagi kau hands on ah ya
arts arts kalau tak ada pandemic pun orang tak nak tapi the need for it lah
dorang ada tuesdays with morrie
abeh ah while the rest ada I don't know ah this city city got show I don't know what is it
I was supposed to uh kerja untuk hotel tau
you know hotels has the such a big show it's like the biggest show like selalu cakap kalau kau boleh kerja hotel kau boleh kerja apa-apa
production pasal is like four hours long like that then like the dresser is A and B you know
so kau ada shift so like oh my god aku takut lah waktu dia cakap ah you want to go hotel then I'm like yes but then I just yes cause I need job right
nasib baik tak ada tak tau nasib baik ke tak
kalau ya seram tapi kalau ya pun wah macam what an opportunity right ya
ya like hotel banyak gila cast then like all the cast is like
orh the third aku baru tengok crazy rich asians
okay lah cerita dia mm not my type lah
awkwafina pun vietnam eh ke korean
entah lah but they just take all and all kind of asian they can take in hollywood lah
okay lah I guess they we're going somewhere the representation tapi macam nampak force sikit ah
and this thing waktu tu aku dengan kakak aku adik aku macam heated heated argument
do we really want representation kalau representation gini macam hijab
macam okay kalau korang step macam diverse tapi macam there's not much
depth into that diversity just macam show off yang oh
show kita ni diverse then macam
some more like apa ni
if like if you kalau kau include orang pakai tudung like just example
kau tak payah taruk plot there something like culture what you don't have to keep like throwing to the audience like oh she's the muslim she's a she's a muslim like can you just like
talk about her like any other character macam okay macam do more about her personal punya character development whatever orh tak payah macam
cina jer cina jer ni martial arts
macam can you really you can just make a show cerita apa yang bagus
cerita ni a good place quite good ah good place
like they never even they never really macam
cause ada ni kan jamil is it is that what you call her
jameela apa nama dia the yang manny
ah nama dia jason jason ah yes
cerita tu tak payah macam force it's not force what but if if you really look at the cast macam quite diverse what
but that one tak macam oh
oh you know tak payah
cerita apa eh
it's bodoh
I saw someone I I saw a interview you know anthony padilla from smosh last time dia interview siapa perempuan tu yes
so dia ada buat porn pakai tudung abeh oh my god it's like so
macam how to say it's like very popular so it says a lot you know
oh my god sia I mean like it it's not kesian ah actually aku dengar interview dia sedih
dia buat sikit jer sia
dia cakap dia buat macam six video or whatever ah like macam ya
okay lah tu lain cerita ah
it's just perempuan dengan lelaki just different
no kalau kalau if you ever come across lelaki yang like like bothered by this
let's say he he he want to macam argue no lelaki pun but no don't even argue because
kalau kau bukan orang tu kalau kau bukan part of that
uh group you shouldn't be sort of defensive what kita bukan punya
kita bukan cakap yang kau kau pervert kau semua pervert bila masa cakap gitu
kita just cakap what's fact it's been decades since
macam tak payah cakap isn't it obvious macam adik aku sometimes gitu pasal adik aku dia
dia annoyed with modern feminism dia cakap
macam you know all this perempuan yang bogel kat street dekat lah all this but then you you shouldn't you shouldn't look at the at the
surface you shouldn't look at the surface tu apa dorang buat jer tapi you should really look at the cause the issue you know ni macam jauh sikit tapi aku nak compare pasal aku suka tupac kan
suddenly tapi banyak orang macam oh black people they are gangster cakap pun macam
pekik-pekik maki-maki each other tapi dia cakap dia there's there's one thing he say very like really got to me he say if you cannot
like the problem is dorang like how they even become like that you know
you know macam how perempuan become so aggressively err berbogel ni ah why they make it until that point you know
ya sedih apa abeh lagi malay drama's not helping
ya allah I don't know how at this day of age people can still produce that kind of show
kahwin contract
malay punya drama kahwin jer itu dorang punya conclusion eh kau tak nak kahwin nanti kau tak boleh kahwin itu jer
oh my god kahwin sia apa-apa problem kau ada kau kahwin
and kalau tak ada anak tu tak apa and like ni semua lain orang punya masalah lain tapi you should really look at the rezeki that you have
instead of we don't have I mean like memang manusia biasa kita selalu macam apa yang kita tak ada we really look
instead of buat cerita suruh orang kahwin kenapa tak buat cerita suruh dorang hargai apa yang dorang ada what the shit eh sorry
abeh nyai aku tengok ketawa-ketawa abeh nyai aku I don't know if she like it or she just like amused by how bad it is
pasal aku suka tengok cerita korea korea is like more in depth like they have a lot of issues
people always say eh you know very sad you know eh nak kat habis eh apa tu kita habis
eh D dah lama tak jumpa uh awak sekarang tengah buat apa ni
alamak uh lynn sekarang tengah kerja kat catering kitchen ah buat kerja part time tapi kalau you nak kerja uh I boleh ajak you kerja lah awak nak tak
alamak kesian
kena the hijab then later got stains all those germs mah so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always uh how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
but you make a promise what to meet her at two like I mean if you are going to be late you can always inform her lah like I'm going to be late so you can macam meet later or you can meet schedule another date ke apa then this one he make her wait
oh no wonder lah you keep messaging me want to go matchmaking cause you want to avoid that situation then I was like thinking why this girl always nak cari boyfriend lah cari husband then I'm like want to go matchmaking together I a bit segan lah
I know what you can do you can go to the mosque and find any imam and then say abang tolong saya
oh my god I feel I feel so weird right now you have so many interesting experiences with people who like you I don't have much but I think I have one story lah it was during my project so um my diploma we collaborated with like engineering students so we have to do like auditing at uh low income households kat yishun ah not really at yishun it's like canberra yishun area so um we were having a briefing and then I was like
and then he said uh can we exchange numbers cause you know for the uh final year project I was like okay lah I mean he's not like the main committee but I was like okay lah why not maybe at least can update him and stuff then after that from then right he keep messaging me on telegram on whatsapp and then during that period right uh what is that movie ah marvel is it not star wars apa movie tu yang viral
oh henry henry punya lagu
but do you still use that same email tak kan
actually I also like him actually he quite handsome remember that time you know you know but it doesn't mean that I like him okay remember that time in secondary school we were sitting like you were sitting in front of me then you sit beside justin then I was with rayson ingat tak
kau buat apa the whole day
then bila I dapat tahu yang dia akan cerai with dia punya uh isteri right
actually I don't know asal dorang break up ah eh asal dorang nak
cerai everything
at that point of time yang aku rasa macam wow he found the one
it was just berapa tahun yang lalu
and I rasa macam
kalau I Bella I pun maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
ya they got back together I think time bulan ramadan I think they got back together that which make me feel macam
don't ah jangan lah judge and everything then I was like oo okay
actually that time I terserempak dia then when I saw him right
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel kesian cause he looks very like
entah lah maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know ah dia kena tangkap pergi karaoke dengan like other girls
buat kot cause like
ya I mean no harm trying ah sebab if you tak try then you'll never know what
from ten to twelve I have like uh group consultation then from twelve onwards is um ten minute consultation with my professor then after that dah balik
no lah like I can balik but at the same time macam I got like macam this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
uh should be kat rumah lah cause sekolah like
ya no fast err there's only one halal malay stall which is ayam penyet
but it's okay lah cause like most of my classes dia online
so kalau online then I just
okay lah bila I first datang right
I feel a bit macam intimidated
asal you tak sabar I thought that
kalau you habis kerja then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
to have like a sense of security kat sana
ah cause I rasa lonely kat sekolah
macam cause most of kita nya classes online kan then dorang macam kita macam tak ada that common like bonding for us to make friends and ni ni semua
the example eh macam kau ada assignment due on week seven
dorang dah habis week
macam kanchiong habis
dorang actually kat sekarang
ah nama dia start with letter L
and dia punya kawan uh I think nama dia start letter B
you know I I nak beli baju daripada Shein you know Shein
I tak ada baju seh pergi sekolah
although I pergi sekolah dua hari jer every week
in your like situation memang susah nak save tau actually
for like kerja kan is just for you untuk
maybe one hundred you simpan
you know I rasa macam this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I rasa macam I've been a snorlax for so long
then sekarang macam
dah bangun kena kerja keras pula tu
you know I feel kan untuk present kita nak beli present untuk lelaki memang susah sebab
lelakinya present selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu because lelaki dorang macam very practical
cause eh I haven't finish cakap lah
okay then takpe kot
can buy him sabun
ya I mean if you want it easy then just baju eh then just uh perfume lah
uh I think it's okay it's just sometimes dia very busy
but at the same time I rasa dia boleh lah
takde lah I mean
that time he met Dakshah also sebab I tak free
huh I very like packed with a lot of things eh I got I struggling with school takde time ah
but it's really difficult to ajar him seh cause
parents dorang tak tahu tau yang actually macam mana nak handle budak-budak and everything
and then they just like feel yang cikgu yang akan
betul kan budak-budak punya pelajaran and stuff but
is very taxing penat seh
I ah boleh
ya I mean people always cakap alah jer pe
to secondary and secondary is like macam
I'm kind of thankful yang kita pergi a secondary school
yang not that macam
wah like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be seh
and all the mats and minahs and
the fact that they start smoking even during macam lower sec and doing a lot of other things
actually I scared seh sebab you know uh recently I nampak kat news kan macam
budak kecil right eh not budak kecil ah like just like lower secondary everything
dorang um they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase eh like it's damn
oh primary school pun
social media ah macam TikTok
and I just tak faham ah cause like I remember that time
err ada cikgu ni dia datang kat
me and then macam cakap lah like ah jangan buat malu keluarga ah jaga maruah keluarga
and then dia macam cakap ah macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua then I just feel that err they don't really understand
cause secondary school kan kita tak pernah lambat seh kita cuma lambat on the last day of school
Afif tak pernah lambat ah
dia pun lagi satu toxic nya orang dalam hidup
cause of her macam
ya I cannot seh dia seriously something wrong with her
I mean if you realize like those macam
there were like macam camne nak cakap eh
mm you know I rasa kan the best coach yang I ada right was actually my Singapore poly nya coach they were really like
and although I macam tak datang training atau I not that good kan dorang still never stop believing in me seh
and then dorang always cakap macam oh Ayra you can do this blah blah blah like that
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise kan actually tak healthy gila seh
flowers kenapa you ingat birthday I ke
I suka um
actually I suka mixed ah you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at macam
I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever nanti dorang letak dalam satu bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower yang macam yellow colour everything then you have like macam
blue colour of flowers and I and then macam ada purple sikit and then I rasa macam oh my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a macam
you know macam brown packaging gitu
oh actually kan I takut seh nak simpan flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday
ya that time bila I simpan flowers kan banyak cicak masuk bilik I seh
cicak lipas then flies
but you know ah I don't know if you pernah dengar there's this cafe called Antea Social
and then they sell like cakes ah oh my god bila I nampak I macam whoa macam sedap jer
macam nak pergi seh but confirm mahal
if I cannot like macam give birth or what right
I should be open to having anak angkat ah cause like
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel macam tak comfortable
ya I tak comfortable I think in a way because like
someone punya
kenapa would you consider
but would you nak would you simpan like cat or whatever pet
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can ah pelihara like
kucing when I dah besar but when I think about it right
I don't know seh it really depends ah whether I have time to jaga them or not
oh my god actually right last time I pergi rumah kawan I cause dia ada rabbit
and then like macam
dorang bising tau
I okay with zoo seh cause I feel yang macam
uh ya it's true ah yang dorang patut be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
oh my god adik I think you're thinking too much eh
cause like I mean it's a zoo what dorang confirm jaga punya

I makan chocolate lah makan apa lah
eh you know kalau you tengok like advertisement everything right they always have like
uh toothpaste right like banyak gila right actually by right it's too much seh actually it's just supposed to be like macam one thin layer on your toothbrush and that is enough

dia macam semberono eh
I don't know macam
bau ah
ya I know I know I know macam ibu punya
eh tak basuh
tapi asal dia build differently is it sebab I I met the brothers in uni
tak the point is if you
tak mandi tak apa asalnya tak bau tau then you have to constantly check yourself what personal hygiene macam
gosok gigi ah please you know like last time like I kerja my supervisor
dia macam jenis yang macam oral hygiene like she don't care it's a she by the way she don't care dia macam ada tahi tahi
exactly exactly so macam kalau personally
it's okay tau macam normal lah you terselit spinach kan
ah leh macam tahi gigi on the surface macam from biofilm
and then when she drink coffee so she drink right and then the coffee stuck at the tahi gigi and then she will talk she will talk and talk and sometimes like was it serious
anyways it's like so macam mana she just talk to me
macam apa eh
itu because kaira focus gila because of her teeth oh my god macam habis kadang-kadang I think kawan kakak and then my friend my colleague also understand so she also want to laugh
asal dia gari emas eh
oh my god kakak tahu macam pakai yang macam itu rasa macam rimas gila eh like there's something on my finger
I don't know I think after a while you get used to especially kan the fake punya stuff
eh tapi cantik I think it's fine ah macam in life you have to experience all these
but it's fine kakak punya tan line masa tu dah lama I think dalam masa dua bulan tan line tu hilang and then like it starts again because that
I was having my menses second day so I morning tu bila ibu tiba-tiba message tau
eh ibu dekat luar rumah
tiba kan
then after that actually actually was abang lukman wanted to go to puncak to eat and then he actually told me kita cycle lah but then I say you gila ke because my bicycle is like macam
half can make it half cannot because that time ah we cycle all over and then my bicycle chain just terkeluar
then I panic ah then oh oh my god okay nasib baik abang lukman ada ah
then hari tu that day she suddenly ibu dekat luar pintu then like then after that thank god I baru habis mandi tau so I just open door
then it ibu dan ayah masuk ah and then ibu layan ayah to go for cycling then because ibu and ayah they are waiting then abang lukman just
then just say abang dengan ayah dekat luar kita pergi cycle lah tak baik macam cause we bunga ayah that time jauh pe naik
then he say oh my god K fine then we go so bila I pergi tu
um okay the thing is abang lukman belajar kan dia tidur pukul macam semalam pukul tiga empat pagi
no dia yang belajar and kakak tidur dia orang sembilan dah dah boleh bangkit and do his
I pukul sebelas pun macam macam kena langgar lori
pukul err sebelas setengah begitu
ya at first and then but then have to wait cause abang lukman berak lama
like thirty minutes later then abang lukman keluar then err we siap-siap and then we go but then I in in macam that chaos and that excitement I terlupa nak err makan breakfast
so I cycle all the way ah daripada sini terus sampai faiz and it was okay I was okay sampai dekat faiz the moment I stand up
uh darah keluar and then after I'm like oh my god terus macam kakak punya ini macam diri macam nak pengsan
then after that um habis tiba-tiba kakak punya vision macam half ah oh my god it was the worst and I thought cause macam overheated panas habis tak makan I a bit uzur
and then after that ah we balik ayah dengan ibu continue to marina bridge
lepas tu balik daripada tu um like kakak pengsan gila macam even bila dah habis makan right
when we were sitting there I am so exhausted like halfway through when dekat yang dekat faiz tu at the caldecott there's like a small
tak boleh cycle I can't like kakak macam terhuyung-hayang and I so panas so I took the air botol and then I pour my
ah macam just just basah and then and then because I cycle and then I wear serkup cause normally I cycle I no wear serkup but cause got ibu mah later ibu scold me
aiya so I wear serkup ah
it's the damn serkup
tapi tak lawa nanti macam pakcik err a'ah
habis macam bawah lawa cause I was wearing my what's that exam T shirt and the nice pant tiba-tiba atas macam kepala sotong
and then kalau masuk mall you have to open mah
your sun hat kirakan macam gila pe sebab I muka nampak apa cause like bulat
tau kalau you that macam muka macam ada mix sikit lawa ah maybe it's acceptable
but our our asian features are just you know ya we can't rock those like macam turban look
I think we have like face feature our face feature macam like for example macam we small like small face and then we have high cheekbone
have high yours and mine is the same what high cheekbones right it's only your hidung besar
so you should press it because last time you always listen to kakak aimah kakak aimah don't like
ah hidung mancung cause he say cause he say hidung tinggi nanti sombong like literally peribahasa hidung tinggi then I was like what the hell
ya so he she always penyek then you always macam hidung kata you just like okay ya ya like that
abang long shape his nose
it's like those like macam perfect macam mancung habis kat sini macam ada sikit habis macam lawa for an
ah for an asian guy so and then because I also ibu also always like you know ibu hidung mancung ah cause atuk is like indian or whatsoever
ah ya whatever so ibu got that hidung mancung mah
then ibu always say hidung hidung penyek cause follow ayah mah so serious I always like picit my hidung cause I want
um hidung mancung then after that I always thought my hidung was big
macam I don't know like macam because like orang keep on saying macam ibu keep on saying hidung besar hidung besar so
so ya lah you tahu when hidung bawang macam bawang bawang gila
bawang ah ya
macam nek onah eh bukan eh nenek
ah ya atuk jer macam handsome kan
I mean uncle zair tak tahu kalau handsome time muda
ah macam okay macam kak mira dengan amsyar
dekat nur and eh ah nur and
so then after that I tak nanti I think I met abang lukman abang lukman say I got small nose
like one of the small nose and like quite mancung for a malay lah then I was like oh I didn't know that
ya but it's still considered small tengok macam tak
apa mermaid man
but then it's like kecil then oh it's actually small and then when now when I look at the mirror
oh it's actually average looking nose it's not that bad you know like what you picture cause I last time I always thought I gemuk
exactly because ayah ayah keep on saying uh
uh gemuk gemuk jangan makan nanti gemuk faham tak so it's like macam daripada kecil you have that body yang gemuk but then padahal you tak cukup makan
ya it's not the normal beras apa
and then aku tak tahu sekarang tapi
tapi macam kakak rasa sekarang kadang-kadang macam I can do it
then bila I stayed at his parents I timbang I was forty nine
lepas tu it was just like
then I I don't know how if I have fluctuate cause kat sana makanan banyak sekarang di sini kita makanan independent so macam
on let's say makan macam sikit sikit kurang sikit
mm kat dekat rumah serangoon last time banyak gila makanan
maybe like don't have plan but maybe dia mak and ayah use car
tak happy eh tapi kan ada minimum
tapi yes mah eh bapa dia nampak demam sikit
masa tu habis masa dah tak ada so semua ni lepas tu tukar jadi babat
habis that day I I took photo and then I send to his ayah lah then I cakap makin tembam budak ni
a'ah habis apa ayam ayam ayam everything ayam kalau tak ada ayam daging
mesti pun hantu ayam because kalau kakak beli macam daging ke atau apa kalau kak masak kakak makan sikit so macam bazir so might as well I cook whatever he wants to eat which is
sahaja luckily your face don't turn into chicken
um habis but then you skin will be saggy
kentang chicken
ya aiya kau ni mahal mahal juga aiya tak tahu nenek cakap satu meal berapa tau beberapa keping ayam
adik tahu satu packet um ayam satu packet ayam berapa satu packet ayam dua paling murah is seven dollar forty five cent
dia lepas tu tanya dia berapa banyak berapa banyak pieces tu ah boleh dapat thirty six
ah separated kalau is thirty six wings chicken drumsticks dengan wing atau lapan belas set of drumstick that is how much tau
itu kalau one week adik makan six kan adik boleh tahan selama three
tapi still mahal you tahu semalam yang kan tangan dimakan tu kau tahu itu berapa
ah sebab bersih sangat mampus kan
I thing is ah I think ah ayah dan ibu even the chicken I mean ah sorry it's not that nice
macam what is the flavour
no she's good at cooking but she like masak but she don't like to taste her food
ah is abang home already
sebab because living room itu baru if you make dekat tu also so it's nicer for him whereas the bilik kan macam dah tunggang pecah if you understand
in the point of macam healing kan it's so much better to be in a clean and newer environment rather than macam old you understand
kena buat partition lah ayah kena panggil buat partition
buat lah partition
that house that house is so big it has so many potential tapi macam
ah recognise or macam ayah eh ayah ayah dah tak kuasa nak keluarkan duit untuk renovate and then ibu pula malas nak maintain so macam oh my god
macam they they put the effort to
cause ayah will start something and then he he will expect ibu to follow up with it
macam dah lapuk is so outdated already I think twenty years it was okay but now it's
why so degil one ah
ya can you imagine kalau rumah aku buat ambin dalam bilik tu nah
kadang-kadang nak buat ambin tapi nak buat yang macam japanese style
ah ya ya ya macam lawa macam just like platform it doesn't need to be a permanent just you can buy the platform is have that one then you just put your bed on top I think quite nice eh macam those
oh is it but you baring if you put your
tilam only if you put your tilam ah
the bawah is literally err
err apa ni like err literally like that tapi tak rasa
you don't feel it ah the only thing bad about that thing right they literally macam blew the papan onto the floor
so kalau macam in the future kalau nak macam shift shift but you can't shift it is like that
but I love a lot of things about japan especially macam dia orang
macam kecil macam dia orang punya design of barang macam macam kecil and it's so efficient in my opinion
so kakak cakap suka gila that time when we went to
kyoto ah then there's daiso a huge ass daiso and then beside it there was like a furniture kedai perabot
I think they literally jual macam one set macam sinki yang ni dan dia punya
cabinet atas dengan cabinet bawah dengan lampu dia dengan dia punya segala-gala lah dia punya there is literally one unit
and boleh masuk bathtub
can you imagine how amazing that is that's like this this this toilet ah macam bodoh sia
why can't they put the jamban and the sink side by side then we have a long ass
jamban just put together right oh my god
why they never think about it I don't know how they design it is so like so bodoh like even the tingkap this one ah
ni kan kalau rumah lama is dekat atas pe
this like for example kalau macam hujan but then you still want air ventilation you can open up the top windows mah then get air in
this one you open you can open the first one on top if you open the below air hujan masuk it's like so bodoh I don't know what are they thinking when designing the house
tapi ini macam bodoh macam bodoh gila
rumah juan yang dekat uh uh huh
macam lawa macam it looks like a bedroom macam ni it looks like a fucking bedroom right no fucking storeroom I don't know it's so weird
the jemuran eh
they don't even know what is inside the kotak right
ah ya but like I think if you wanna buy your furniture macam tu if ikea stuff don't buy on the kedai itself pergi carousell
jual and then jual dia harga macam murah gila babi yang itu macam apa seh dining table dua puluh aku beli dua ratus
so macam geram gila macam ini set alarm right um we bought this two hundred and forty
ah macam banyak
ya kau macam eh sakitnya hati ya allah ya
so macam tak perlu seh I mean like the thing macam almari ni seven hundred whereas we can actually bought it at
brand new lagi just have to fucking dismantle it and it is still very cheaper than buying a
itunya macam menyesal so kadang-kadang kan just buy from carousell
I mean yang paling biasa I carousell kadang-kadang dia ada kasih dengan free items eh
apa add on
tak free stuff macam orang kasih free orang nak macam just siapa-siapa nak ambil free ah macam give away
orh I'm okay ah tapi lately rabak ah because uh apa ni COVID kan so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
atau just uh watch new dramas lah basically
correct correct then the one that I regret the most sekarang is uh apa ni the one that you invited me to watch ah demon slayer
for me personally right ah uh aku bukan a fan of apa ni macam cute cute uh type of err art style for the err anime for me I prefer like macam semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret gila serious because it's like uh the storyline bagus and then like dia punya action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away ah so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right uh it was
that's why but err but err adding on to yang the older punya animes even initial D pun kan it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then macam it got so much hype and like so much um err attention right it just blows my mind ah ya and I really thought it's it's really nice lah and
not gonna lie ah it's very rare um for this kind of err shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause ah the part yang
err I think is the one yang the second episode yang dia pergi bunuh the very big demon then he touch the head
uh ya the the the one who killed the punya kawan
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was um the apa moon that got strip of his uh power pasal dia tak uh eat enough humans the one who use the drums ah
ya uh I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then tak ada orang appreciate dia so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
uh terkesan like I was like shocked lah when I cried a bit I was like eh tak pernah pernah macam gini the last time I cried was like err what endgame
kompang kompang gitu
err tapi tapi stress ah yang err dia punya battle tu the other one that err was more stressful was the punya the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
sekali a one time slash then mati
that's why tak fair gila serious
ya ya even the intro dia punya what they call it opening I don't know opening ah the opening was also quite macam blood pumping ah for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally eh for you is the music kan for me is the ah story line itself
um uh give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect macam dia tak just bunuh cause oh you're a demon cause err he take the time to like understand them look back ah look through their memories and then like say like eh you used to be human lah so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
I I kind of uh apa ni regret a bit right apart from um not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that err to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime ah like macam I look macam ah sometimes look at the art style macam very cutesy cutesy dia macam takda substance to it ah but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some animes are good it's not everytime macam those like uh act cute atau macam very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the animes are really damn good so aku macam semi regret so for me personally ah for demon slayer right I started on naruto
um ah I know it's one of the best animes but draggy gila it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch ah but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also ah the day before pasal one piece so that one will try so I start naruto first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer naruto or one piece ah actually
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes lah so it's not too not too macam mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya tapi are these sorry is this the format for err anime like each episode got twenty minutes atau
oh kira macam movie is it
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm hilang ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking ni kan sekarang ah apa ni uh I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
ya I see your math semalam jer dah tak boleh tahan that's why I I don't take math
correct correct yang semalam you show me the pasal apa tu row operation that one obviously I try ah but I really I really don't understand lah but the first few question I understand lah ya
ah something like that ya ya but sorry my math tak bagus sangat
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you ah force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself tak faham then you have to like uh you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt juga
yeah I guess macam uh if like you if you like tanya then like you didn't try then think macam people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really kalau macam we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about uh your course is that uh at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally rabak gila ah ah I take english but then like err if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment juga
ya ya cause mak kau cikgu ya ya ya that's why it's it's true ah like I I always thought I had the mindset like boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri just belajar jer just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you ah they call it um crystallisation of your thinking like make your uh ah word flow much more uh smoother ah in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya eh tak tak I I saw in my study guide apa crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation uh like um basically they encourage macam um making study groups and all that cause for me like uh like you err yourself ah aku pun introvert that time um when I want to try ask macam malu-malu cause I feel paiseh ah like macam
oh kira macam the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe ah
in a way ah in the same time at the same time from what you explain macam is to juggle the perasaan of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
um some um I think it's very rare lah that there are people who are very macam clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to jaga hati and try to be more mindful what they say
as very um ruthless or very blunt lah macam later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel macam very um
ah that's why that's why rasa kecil hati kirakan ya
ah then when they continue doing that then they don't learn kan they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise asal semua orang keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me masa dulu I was very sensitive so now I try to macam balance out lah
ya can I share one story ya okay pasal I'm guilty of this so err so err err err the the one thing that err you mentioned about time management there is it for me kan honestly speaking ah
balance and all that so I admit ah sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so um before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I uh consulted err my partner and my mother then they said that is fine lah then I think about it macam tak affect my grade cause there was a time before what I failed my exam then my uh drop rabak gila then lepas tu um
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like um if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just err restudy lah and the good thing ah about my school now is that since COVID right uh they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right uh you have to pay the fee tau it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free lah cause of COVID so like I'll just do it lah but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty macam I feel so bad macam kirakan I can clear the mod one then macam I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again uh cause uh the last time I checked if I fail again kan
aku boleh tendang sekolah lah like fully ah I err I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is err academic termination then you have to it's as if err after you kena terminated it's as if you have to err re-enrolled lah to the school so that's the downside lah so I'm like ah I don't wanna take the risk ah I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away kena that kind of
ah ah that's what I kena ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos ah if I'm being honest so like I think about it ah takpe lah just resit ah
I don't want to risk it ya sakit sia hati that time ya
uh are there but how there are different so that um when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english eh I'm if I'm speaking english and kau cakap macam ah there are structures to it that make it different ah I think it's ah sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages ah
ya something like that lah like they have a uh a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences ah ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages ah if like you use uh malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like susah
it's a translation but then like err one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like err the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part ah ya I think there was once I I look err the one that my prof taught me was err apa ni
professor ya sorry err professor ah eh ah so casual panggil prof uh she talk about english in uh do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya allah eh sorry sorry err so basically um
pejabat office right
ah pejabat pos so it's like it's reverse ah so that's the different thing
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it ah so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so panjang right so like ah tau boleh takpe lah just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly uh change it like that like um they just make it english language and literature like um why they don't have the presets cause last time uh when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that um
ya tak comfortable
correct ya cause nanti err it will be natural
for you to start comparing with others tau then nanti macam okay for example you got a posh you nampak orang ni ada Ferrari then you see ah people got um apa Burgundy Burgundy Honda then later you get Burgundy Honda later you got Ducati it never ends tau so like when you keep buying more things like this you think like um err you're making yourself happy cause you are getting everything you want since you are a kid what tapi what you're doing right is you are sort of uh
apa ni putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you
unfortunately he died already ah it's iron man games of thrones tak game of thrones tak that uh one prime uh character in the Marvel uh
uh adding to your part macam uh when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually uh apa ni
belief and then like ah actually um it's not technically a superpower lah but it's more of like it's err apa tu
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing eh cause I just realised this now I'm having this uh eh epiphany macam if you notice eh in endgame
uh black widow and iron man tak ada power tau but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then uh iron man dia uh take the apa tu uh gauntlet from err thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really ah all the efforts for nothing but then like err he managed to get all the infinity stones on his uh hand then he just snap ah so it takes a lot of um courage to do that you know so like it was is is really um mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
ya macam that day jer this is the type of body that you want on the beach oh my goodness
ah dah kurus ya ya
dan cause also um
like it's even more um ah amplified lah I guess lagi lagi malu lah kirakan
tak boleh ah some do play some do play not going to lie tapi um
ya sebab but it's more suited for the mature audience ah
eh tak lari eh topic lari that's why
okay okay takpe takpe go jer
kat mars
dia pergi eh
atau Grab express uh deliver parcel
young ah wah that's a good thing eh like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any apa tu
ya ya orh then err it'll be relatable to uh demon slayer when uh in the movie uh what's his name eh ah correct me if I'm wrong ah asaka ke akaza akaza he wanted to offer uh rengoku to be a a demon what ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die ah so
um if you remain at technically if you get to live forever atau you um remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it uh like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
but probably why ah sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable ah err probably why the apa six demon didn't uh
nama saya nadi
enam tahun whoa
ada contract
jadi sudah sudah tujuh eh enam tahun
dah enam tahun wow
lagi satu tahun tengok lah macam mana
ya betul betul betul
mengidam eh
pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan or the bunny chow tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba it's a whole loaf of bread
ya ya and it was recommended ramai orang suruh order
ah cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu so kita orang saja lah tanya-tanya eh apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah try ini semua
terus err
apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh try bunny chow terus ada satu customer pun suruh kita orang try bunny chow
terus kita orang try ah ya ingat tak the customer
terus wah it it was the best decision we've ever made
ya kita nak makan banyak kira you know pros and cons kena give give in ya oof
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that sebelum tu kita orang try ah McDonald's
then saja saja
saja nak try tengok country apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya ah McDonald's
tapi tak tak sedap sangat lah singapore punya standard terlalu tinggi saya rasa
a'ah I I boleh boleh rasa yang ini
ah ye ye ye ye ye
jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni plus kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada community melayu juga
uh jadi kita ingatkan
walaupun err the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
makanan mesti ada mesti ada ah sedikit ah yang sama kan
oh okay I remember ada samosa
ye ke lupa ah oh okay interesting I forgot my memory not good
dah dah dua dua tahun eh
err practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was apa eh
oh oh I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was daging and there was cheese it was
it was oh it was basically like roti john but they throw in uh fries also so ya and sayur also so it was like a whole meal with a
dengan ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch
ya dalam lima minit tiba-tiba makanan dia dah sejuk kan
a'ah tak boleh taruk tepi pun kan
mmhmm pasal ice box<malay>dia ice box dia share nanti takut orang curi kan ya
lepas tu we also didn't want to throw I remember
oh wow tu semua pahadal dah lupa seh now all the memories are like coming back
eat like they didn't have much to eat jadi apa dorang buat is apa-apa dorang boleh dapat all the ingredients bahan-bahan dorang ambil taruk dalam roti terus makan jer
sedap but it was like a it was an experience lah it was really just all at once ya
gila weren't didn't think properly lah basically
mmhmm okay juga
kita orang tak tak bersedia at all ya
terus macam kita orang tengok atas kalau kita tengok atas tengok macam puncak dia masih tak sampai-sampai ah masih jauh lagi dalam hati ke
a'ah lepas tu oh yang yang saya masih ingat is a
on the way up ada satu orang orang ni tengah lari tengah buat morning exercise dia dia tengah bersukan lari naik turun gunung
jadi kita orang fikir eh ni ni agaknya masih masih
masih okay lah agaknya akan sampai lah siapa yang lari naik turun gunung eh
jadi kita orang ah tak jauh mesti tak jauh terus ingat dia ada anjing sekali ikut dia
saya ingat saya fikir dalam hati okay mesti dekat mesti dekat jadi continue naik ke atas continue naik
ah ada tempat duduk
ah dah naik a'ah
dua jam mak ah
ah eh tapi masa dia punya dia punya apa
ah permandangan cantik lepas tu
pun it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
a'ah tu tu lah tu lah
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit
terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba ah angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari eh
a'ah memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa mountain gear tu semua ada yang stick panjang tu ah hiking stick dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja jer jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu
and we just rest and reflect apa kita orang buat tadi
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like ah tak puas cause like
cause I was really curious I actually tengok ah video signal hill macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas grass semua okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
I got I got jio one friend she she also malay okay we all melayu together
lepas tu we could have like walk down almost tour you know
ah gi jalan-jalan
uh uh I remember uh ada makan makanan macam fish and chips
that time kau rasa
like aku masih ingat like for for the trip was mostly the experience and I feel like the
the activities dengan kawan-kawan pasal ah I ingat dalam kita orang naik van lepas tu ada tiga van ada tiga van four is it ah ada empat van dalam satu van ada dalam tujuh atau sepuluh orang
gitu going through puberty
dengan ya kita orang dengan a few other singaporeans right I remember
ah dorang gaduh
ah kita orang walaupun ah
aku ingat ada berapa orang dalam van tak suka budak ni tapi walaupun kita tak suka kita masih baik kita orang tak tak ada dengki ke apa kita cuma
so we we sort of came to consensus that we kita orang akan bersama dalam berapa
trip tu berapa hari ye
ya one week kita orang came up with a consensus we will be together for one week so we should we should get along so even we don't like this boy we try to we try to you know make this
ya he also seem to enjoy it and I know he's aware that a lot of people don't like him lah jadi macam kesian sikit juga lah
okay lah dia minta gambar tak apa
hantar jer
okay to be fair budak tu kalau kita orang kalau kita punya kayak sebelah dia dia akan
dia akan tolak atau dia akan splash water ah lepas tu
ah I ingat that ah I have a fear of uh the sea
so that was not helpful whenever he tolak my my kayak
macam mana nak lukis just bukan lukis saja-saja tau macam lukis macam macam artist gitu
macam boleh dapat kerja like macam graphic design ah
okay pasal adik saya seorang artist jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang
macam uh swimming
at this bridge bridge dia is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
the um tahun lalu I went to krabi dengan kawan krabi okay
like I will be responsible for that jadi jadi I remember after that I
like dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
tak no it was it was it was already like
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes pasal dia punya air air dia clear kan
banana boat ada tu ada lah but
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is kita orang dua bukan orang kayak
and then I remember okay mula-mula there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care lah too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
there's certain places you can kayak right kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar lah but anyway gi kayak dekat
ah tahu tapi kawan-kawan I semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat marina barrage ada kat lakeside pun padahal ada
ya I I actually uh baru belajar macam mana nak float masa kat krabi because err
I suruh ya I suruh kawan saya ah ajar macam untuk sorry lah eh vishu teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
good enough okay jaga diri sendiri
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me ah nadirah jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal
kalau tak nanti ah nanti penat pengsan kau dah lah selalu pengsan kau jangan
ya bawa gula bawa apa protein bar ke apa
I'm like aww tak aku tak bawa
aku terus lupa cause naturally
on the way up cause okay naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari
dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu ah
kita orang ada bayar guide lah untuk bawa kita orang ke atas
lepas tu dorang ada ah ada tempat-tempat tidur
macam this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga kan kita orang lah dua hari naik turun naik eh naik ada
kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal time tu macam june june daerah kita orang daerah southeast asia kan monsoon season kan ah ah terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena stop apa semua and then I remember there were certain point where
ya then she did that but then I remember macam the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
ah dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang
like lima belas twenty
it's like if you there you see the statue is like besar gila so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
ya I don't know I just find it interesting lah but ya lah then I remember after the trip we basically we kita orang tour from the north
the city dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu and just get moving down down down all the way to ho chi minh kind of thing
no lah no me and vishu are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very kasar like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then ah after that err
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her lah ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them lah but agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask oh kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip bukan holiday holiday tau the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know ah like you cannot be too luxurious lah dia macam too suspicious
that kind of thing terus aku ajar naik motor cause aku boleh naik motor kan terus dia kata ah tapi ah kalau orang catch kita orang tak ada license macam mana terus aku macam
siapa nak catch kau sia
ya aku realised just okay siapa nak catch kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku lah apa-apa jadi aku ada license then I was like apa sia kau takut banyak
sana punya orang punya license pun a'ah dorangnya license pun questionable kan
lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
like eh ah oh terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang vietnam jadi dia based her own experience dari situ dia kata kakak I kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia survey seratus orang boleh lah aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia kan satu orang
dia bukan cabut dia macam okay
a'ah plan dia memang until that time jadi ah pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu chill aku dengan dia kita orang jadi good friends terus habis tu ah dia halfway through kena pergi laos
untuk internship
ah kita kena fikir
kita orang kena calculate you know kat depan tu
a'ah tu lah dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi tapi dengar jer ikut jer ya
aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu ah jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi laos untuk internship
and then lagi satu perempuan tu ah yang masalah sikit dia padahal free tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia err visitor sorry dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana lah dia dah decide yang okay
since budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi ah jadi jadi macam gitu lah
ah tak payah lama-lama lah okay lah that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya tak payah there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her lah ya
ya banyak tempat
boleh lah dalam masa depan
main balik ah
yang ayam punya rank
hero lama
aku main more to majors tho so
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention aku punya
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told aku actually spend
like at least for me kan aku kena baca all the builds dulu tau dengan tengok video semua before aku main
kalau rank
rank siang my chicken rank
where people think like kita semua
player baru but
aku join lah
cause like if you fight from afar then siapa yang nak fight dekat depan tiada orang
oh ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when kita lolita dengan apa ah
like lolita dengan siapa
um but aku nak try fighter juga ah
ya ya it's the freya it's the fighter and they did dia orang macam revamp freya right but because macam tiada orang like no one really hear nor really plays freya that much so
actually itu aku smash buttons jer bro aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca skill pun
aku just smash smash
tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang lah then like
hmm so the skin pretty lah but the skill not there ah itu itu I think kau main dengan aku punya freya aku think kau pun boleh menang eighteen senang gila
the rank so I think aku just
I also can like ideate do some research on freya sikit jer bukan macam full blast macam aku punya vexana semua yet if you hear my vexana right
menang menang menang all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
um tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat lah some more vexana is like slow kind
so macam easy target gitu macam macam dia orang walking ducks then kau hunt dengan rifle then it's hunting season lah bro so like
shoot shoot jer tapi aku mage so ya aku shoot shoot gini lembat gila tapi target masih kena
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun dia macam
merapek it's like one of those weak
majors but kalau kau tahu main then dia lah tapi kalau kau tak tahu main
then ramai orang panggil kau
apa ah jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
aurora is lembab
dia tahu golek golek jer
vexana burns um dia punya target semua tapi like aurora

kau tahu kau dalam bush kan then you press this one skill later your speed laju
nanti kau zoom dengan hilda dengan dia punya muscle muscle dia
itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat like kalau ada music background ah nanti dengar
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it mana ada spend ah
simpan pun buat apa ini apa saving account
were to put a real term on hilda it's like all of a sudden kan kau tengah buat kerja
then all of a sudden ada one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right ah semua kan dah ada tempat protector semua
so dah lah habis lah
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then bila mana dia habis kan then
you burn your health then macam like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then kau imagine kau dah tiada mana then kau pun burn down
dah double edged sword lah itu
lost world itu
where as hilda is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise minum protein semua
but I need to practise hilda I so so scared dia orang pun debuff hilda eh cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing hilda
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly dia orang ban macam tak make sense lah
no lah ah ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus dia orang ban siapa like basic gusion
oh cause did not admit cause dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka smash smash button abeh
entah masuk meeting macam mana itu kidding lah
nak buat apa dengan kita punya container tank itu eh
so nak plan macam mana
kita check in abeh tidur
I think I uh I ask him afterwards kita berbual lain lah but then
um okay wait let's go back to the main topic kita staycation
then he was like okay first day mm check in tidur then my kawan like are you serious bro
but okay lor I mean first day check kita can rest dulu lah but then
dia dapat one week tau one week like he don't have to dia tak payah kerja satu minggu seh
kau tau tak the company standard is before like kalau the end of you know before the new year eh new year the same thing lah before the end of the year
like everyone all the all the employees dia orang dapat one week
oh but his one week kan then he tell me so kalau that one week dia tak pergi mana mana
pergi gym everyday lah then aku macam eh
kau tahu tak bila itu hari kita pergi gym kan
dia dah baring dekat bench
dah dia baring abeh dia nak tidur then aku macam fikir kau nak pergi gym hari-hari ke are you okay girl I I don't want to see that happening man
no kita kena pergi
ada along the way oh wait ah there's andes
oh man I forgot where's that tak kan airport eh no we're not grabbing please eh he's already
aku aku nak split pun dia tak kasi
it could be a full court also I don't know why I say andes this is the first thing that pop up I think cause recently pergi airport abeh pergi andes
macam lain sikit ah
tapi aku andes pun bukan punya aku makan ayam aku makan
then after lunch then I think by two then kita
I can blend my nasi gorengnya my nasi gorengnya what is it called apa itu um
rempah you mean
ah yes rempah then like fast game boring lah
or is it too too melampau
nanti you take over cause I might just end up
you gonna spend eighty five dollars on a care bear punya baju okay wait if you want to buy the baju just the baju and then you wear like jeans
why why why would you spend on that care bear baju and then wear outside
with the care bear baju and seluar
weird on him I don't know I imagine spongebob kaki pakai care bear shorts
err okay first day kita check in then lepas check in
eh no no first day lepas dah pack
then lepas dah check in
I think we can save to say kita rest
dinner kita makan luar like around the area just get the feel of
then lepas itu
kita um
no I think okay since before that right like on the first day kita
then kita rest balik dekat container then the gym is not that far then I'd rather we just gym at night
oh wait tapi kau takut kau takut kau takut kan kalau nak pergi okay okay pagi let's go pagi gym pagi gym aku lupa sorry
okay okay kau lari kan so me and haizat kita dalam gym kau lari dalam container lah kita buka window so we can see each other
whoever kalah then must go out chase you again then go back in then we on replay oh itu dah cardio dah fuyoh
I think aku quite relax
tapi aku macam lepas aku dah gym I really need to shower
lepas trampoline park kan dah sweaty sweaty semua the first thing that we're going to come out of haizat mouth is let's grab back ah I mean wait wait wait wait trampoline park dekat mana
okay lah I mean I don't mind grabbing there first cause like if we're about to I think I'd rather we just like wake up early then start our day early lah then macam
um tak payah grab cause grab spend extra money I mean like this haizat he do you know that his grab account is platinum
mm then what are you guys shopping for shampoo air air our fridge is big though oh no no no we definitely need ice cream okay we'll definitely going to squeeze in food we'll definitely going to squeeze in um netflix and ice cream night
no all of your guys have no taste takde trust just kidding my taste is just
no no no I swear aku tak tengok spongebob it's really by memory based
err but to argue that I did watch but itu bila itu macam like
like lima tahun kau punya winx club satu tahun pun tak boleh I'm pretty sure you watch winx club recently I don't even know why you watch winx club okay lah I won't judge you then at least you don't watch my little pony if you do I will judge
boleh lah time to rank up lah bro
penat entah macam okay one of the reason eh sebab secondary school dengan primary school dah habis sekolah tau so macam ah dah nak masuk holiday mindset aku dah macam ah nak holiday nak holiday nak holiday abeh tapi poly masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja ah lagipun during this period ah the exams are like
nak kena apa jaga safe distancing kan so like the exams are out so most of our
so macam and most of the time kan my graded assignment semua kena buat report and for report confirm nak kena buat research banyak
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a banyak benda ah so
macam by the time dah habis sekolah macam ah dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat and nak balik rumah one hour journey macam just the thought about it dah buat aku penat and when I came home
I submit lah but it was like ah macam
half half macam macam fifty percent punya reflection journal a'ah ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya itu jer abeh like
like you saw ah macam I just macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis oi
eh but your poly days macam lagi rabak because
like creativity like err macam ah
no because three point one is more of macam internship tau and these tuesday ada briefing on the internship ah and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it macam I don't know because macam okay macam I don't know eh because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced kau macam put it in a beautiful way
tapi tapi just the thought of um having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean err ya it was at home so like but quite like mendak macam like err no err so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that yang assigned dia through
I don't know lah dia tak elaborate ah but but yeah it was mostly a research
dia datang for like one two days first two days leh then the period starts
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first kan orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like macam familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building tapi for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
macam gitu ah so like and kan dorang like most of my kawan yang year ones
dorang like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the ah school punya website
so macam
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right kan so macam dorang macam
how am I supposed to berbual with this person gitu ah
no lah I berbual english because by the time right for my batch dah banyak ada yang ambil tamil gini semua
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret masuk poly ya but
but I didn't regret masuk poly because like because certain things macam how
okay so aku macam old schools sikit computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how kental I am
ya so diam so ah so bila masuk poly tiba-tiba dah kena buat ah share document and all that then I was like apa ni apa ni I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like macam
like I don't know I don't know ah macam if I think that macam eh
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like huh apa ni like what am I supposed to do there ah so macam
no wonder kau selalu pergi library I thought it was to like to baca buku no
since I'm already eighteen right so macam some some things that actually almost all of the things kan kau kat aku
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so macam I tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things daripada mami dan abi macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda everything first hand aku selalu dapat second or third hand aku macam I was kind of jealous at that point of time tapi that
macam dengar like what's like actually what happened actually so macam okay lah not deserved lah macam
not deserve lah macam okay lah deserve lah sikit deserve lah
macam messenger facebook
oh secondary three secondary four okay so macam
okay firstly kan since ah okay so the teachers pun macam tahu ah like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates semua macam ah heck care macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni just it was that bad uh like even like teacher pun macam what
tapi for me right
why not have fun macam macam this is the last few days sebelum like macam like some macam ya macam ya
a good memory lah so like our class macam quite
rabak ah to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like macam act serabak dorang lah like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
ah so macam
I had to do most of the things that macam
like attendance ah keep track of apa
dah hantar acknowledgement slip or whatsoever ah so and most of the time even the teachers know that ah
macam tanya monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one yang akan represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
it was that bad so macam all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students ah twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
tak ada satu pun ah terpaksa ah ah
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one lah the four years lah it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like kakak was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time err I don't know leh because ah tapi like they most of the teacher point out ah like I am so different from you and abang ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what macam ya no matter what ah
aku akan avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
B three I don't want to tell you tak payah ah so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us dah macam go through many things so like and sec three sec four ada macam project macam masa tu ada this international is a apa humanitarian job ah so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising lah so like almost like everyday kita orang stay back and macam pop up macam this one booth kita orang jual air jual roti jual pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates lah so macam and had a lot of fun lah then bila secondary four okay by the time secondary four semua orang dah tahu that is going to be the last year and this is the last time untuk macam rebel ah bukan rebel ah as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow ah macam and since kita orang dah tahu is our last year kan semua orang makin rapat
and then so macam
even when macam ah the teachers like complain about us and then our class macam ah it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
macam this class macam hais this class like ah ah
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us err pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy err male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like oh my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like err on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear punya height
eh tak actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder ah so macam everytime right I will like gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek then sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi so macam uh geram ah but this kind of memories like macam ah
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days macam it's just like
A B C D E F ah so macam but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class ah
but then like for the lower class right dorang like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing kesian juga macam like everyone akan tengok ya but then but the thing I hated the most because kita orang the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because kita orang macam macam ah okay ah tak payah apex camp no I am more of a person of yang tak suka interact bukan antisocial
cuma I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend ah ni
kau hold grudge eh
so means dorang stay back longer than kau stay back ah
oh then why didn't you like cakap to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six punya kerja
but did you realise everytime during camp or macam stay over kat sekolah kan
like most of us are macam tak tidur
oh korang tidur eh
oh no because for my batch right macam everytime kalau ada macam ada qiyam or macam macam sleep kat sekolah kan
selalu like malam kan kita orang tak tidur
kita orang kita orang uh tidur dekat level three the boys tidur dekat level one but then ah toa payoh
ah okay so ah so but then kita orang dekat level three kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual ah with the girls ah kita orang berbual ah macam gossip something like that
like dekat parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand kita orang macam curious ah like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning oh one lah
then kita orang semua gather abeh tengok like
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did ah but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like tak tidur so the rest kena punishment but then right I think the male teachers like macam
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep macam tak terganggu with any check
creepy keras
and it was all girls lah but dah tak ada lelaki so ah ah oh then suddenly like two of us macam nak beli makanan and because it was during lunchtime and dah penat ah so okay lah the so it was left with me and another one friend lah kat dalam
suddenly we heard the same thing you know the macam the drain ya
of the another car park yang sebelah Mendaki sense it was the other it was the other side so like there's no car
there should be no car beside us and is at the level one so macam eh
why would I know that's why kita orang dah macam curious then so like err okay actually me and my friend were like talking so macam we heard that sound then we were like
kita orang diam kita orang like give each other a look ah then like okay ah how about we just like macam macam
ah ah kita orang rasa macam how about we err we buy drinks from the vending machine then I was like so kita orang keluar a'ah
add up bila dekat luar baru kita orang macam did you hear that
but to be honest like the chalet or the like house right macam scary like the vibe
and it was like so far from the bus stop and the bus stop pun like quite sunyi
to be honest I've never encountered this type of situation and I don't want to encounter this type of situation ever because to be honest I'm quite a scary cat juga lah
no because because to be honest compared to the both of us kau lagi rabak so I had to be the one yang okay with it so macam ah I cannot
I think it was during the lunchtime lah so macam uh so some of us like went out to
mafia game eh no eh I don't know it was one of the games so we had macam macam ah
bukan application lah it was just a website kita orang ini so kita orang enter macam this group I'm in that kira macam game pin
then the masuk no no it was not telegram it was just a website ah so macam dah gitu so they will assign the mafia or the spy gitu so for that game we had to question each other lah like okay so ah what is this place this place have like
it was the Mendaki side punya Mendaki sense punya side and was the second level and the other corner bukan the corner to parade square the other corner nak masuk hall canteen
err how about we stop this this game because no one tau because we always like eh macam I point like someone else lah it was you then the other guy was no I thought it was you no I thought it was you so we were like who is this ah ah ya that's why we showed our phone lah macam no it's not us tak ada pun tak ada like kita orang tengok kat phone kan
eh all of us are like the macam workers staff at the place tak ada orang the spy
ah no the like no we macam they would like macam is there macam enough players kira macam this is like dah macam start the game so that only the players kira macam even we didn't like say the game pin out loud so macam none of us like
tak ada orang ah boleh suspect[oh no what happen oh because the day before kita orang tengok
during the stay back punya time ah mengundang
because I don't know because like it was like with the class kan so macam the scary movie macam the horror movie macam tak affect tak affect langsung ah
but then the next day it happens so kita orang macam ya
because they have to tap to masuk right
uh like apa with
kunci or was it a lock or oh pin okay
this dengan siapa
okay cakap pasal horror stories right
okay one of my friend have sixth sense dia boleh
like dia boleh nampak a few things like things that you cannot kita orang tak boleh nampak ah
so there was this one time kat dalam class
but then I just sat beside her except because kawan rapat kan no it was in primary school it was ah level eight so the teacher was like teaching okay lah macam biasa
then suddenly my kawan macam eh why is this guy standing outside from just now then I was like
pusing ah pusing tengok then I was like there's no guy there's no one
then I was like because um I'm quite macam rapat juga ah primary six and our class is at the eight level which is the highest level and
ya it's quite macam nanti ada connected to another building and that building quite
kosong there's no one it's empty ya so I was I was turning my head then I was like I saw no one then I was like I macam dah hyperventilate macam apa ini what is happening but um I quite rapat dengan dia so I know that she can see these things lah
again lah if he is he still standing there because mungkin it's just a person like just passing by or something lah going another class or just another parent ke tengah nak tunggu their child I don't know I just thinking a lot of possibilities situation ya then
not so clear like he's like just like macam bayang
and dia pakai baju black clothes clothing don't don't don't don't then okay okay then I ask my friend lah
like imagining stuff on like on my right side of the class so macam no I was supposed to be at end of the side because that was my friend kan so macam I wanted to sit beside her lah teman for that class for that lesson
tak akan nampak that thing macam I just don't want to see that thing macam tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I don't want I don't want I don't want I just avoid looking at that
oh macam my humanity korang ah but then you don't
any humanitarian punya
you mean belakang as in the dekat dengan lift or

satu dish susah seh question tu
aku rasa saya semua dish semua mak aku masak sedap

aku punya mind aku macam wait are they are they needing orang nak berbual
untuk event or something aku macam yes this is my opportunity
aku berhati-hati interview rupanya
oh okay lah boleh lah
I was thinking macam aku mati-mati yang macam ah aku buat macam
host and event or something macam itu tau
they need speaker for an event macam macam macam lagi oh bukan is not
hey tapi banyak seh
penat sia satu um we need to be mentally prepared satu kau punya pantat kena duduk satu jam satu itu semua lah
unless kalau they give us like you know like a questionnaire untuk kita buat or I mean like not questionnaire atau paper but I think macam they ask us a question that you have to elaborate begitu aku rasa it will be better
macam aku interview orang so macam kita kan seleksi yang better compared to us having a normal conversation and we don't have that case conversation macam kena record
oh ya kau tadi kau
aku macam aku macam
aku macam tengah contemplating a lot
aku macam a lot of thing tengah main lah fikiran otak aku
aku tahu dekat they have like satu ni where you become masyarakat kau tahu macam every
how do I say this like sometimes macam radio station or even macam company oh macam gag
yes they all do those challenges tukar inti itu
okay the kakao macam the face of apa cakap
faces of her school no macam kau buat cara cakap youtube dia orang bagi
yo senangnya kerja tu orang main game aje
the would I have belakang tapi like have to climb
fikir game apa yang best

ada each poly ada
each poly ada ada
ada extreme runner dia main silat air tu like like is like right the same thing
aku nak join but the fact dia punya
copy timing dia is
mm betul like
aku macam I want to find that is fun but kalau ada sikit macam not much commitment lah gitu
macam aku okay aku contemplated a lot of benda firstly ibadat secondly aku nak masuk um
apa begitu macam um voluntary work tapi dekat macam banyak gila voluntary work aku boleh buat
so I think volunteering work yang they work banyak ada yang buat sikit
so aku nak cari yang banyak dan sikit so right now tak takde takde satu pun yang cipta untuk aku
aku pun nak elak nak masuk islamic
macam tu content nanti banyak benda
ya islamic punya group
they ada for that
mm aku ingat macam the name is macam malay cultural group itu tapi dia have different macam cabang-cabang
so macam ideas mm
tapi aku ni dari yang islamic punya community
tapi tu best
macam dia orang masuk um buat amal ramadan
dia orang pack pack barang aku sangat suka tahu cakap tak tahu
okay nah aku macam
ajak a lot of macam fun
tapi macam aku nak banyak masuk tapi macam
macam commitment dia macam kau tahu tak aku punya course macam mana my course is a very
cause course aku is not an easy course
I I definitely say I could've mentally prepared to costly either that I might need to wake up two o'clock to do my journal to do my journalism punya apa topic
mass comm is like easy easy apa easy course untuk masuk
and dia punya content pun macam kau tengok lah if like mass comm
mm film some video dengan editing yang itu kan these are the courses yang macam indirect hiburan and at the same time dia orang macam ah burn the midnight oil lah gitu dia orang cakap
ada orang shooting sampai dua pagi
wah bayangkan
aku rasa aku ada week kalau macam tu aku chillax chillax
silakan farzana mahu tidur lah
tinggal berapa minit ni ya allah empat puluh tiga forty three more minutes
oh aku di intern kan aku rasa
I might go to macam music what's that call music punya
aku nak belajar overseas like aku nak belajar overseas aku nak belajar overseas sebab aku nak rasa ya
being independent ya because kalau kau belajar overseas kau takde you have no excuse to know not how to cook
you must know how to cook to survive because kalau kau cakap home mak aku masak aku tak nak masak
kalau kat luar I have to cook for myself
so at the same time kau belajar untuk berdikari do household rasa macam mak aku rasa
so aku macam nak experience that thing tapi macam kesian pun lah tinggal parents aku
mungkin sebab you have like sister that's why like you don't have sister will be their house buruk-buruk macam mana pun kakak kau akan tetap kat di situ tapi the fact aku ni kakak
aku macam aku rasa macam berat aje tinggalkan mak aku berat jer tinggal family aku
we should though macam
ah overseas ke
actually aku macam nak masuk malaysia tapi macam
daftar sekali korea takde korea uh
cuma feeling kita pergi australia australia kat aku rumah australia

like recording conversation I mean like for me personally kalau dua orang macam
lagi lagi iffa kau masukkan iffa dalam conversation ini it's gonna be like
I don't know how to describe lah kalau macam ni macam mana nak describe
um I think like kena satu ada satu topic untuk berbual
iffa iffa will always have that satu topic untuk ya converse within dua kita orang dua
aku anggap kita macam like more toward like bual-bual kosong
oh yang lelaki tu kan
eh they gave him macam
apa conditional a warning
aku rasa itu macam ada orang ought to see
like it's me kalau benda seorang yang benda sama ya
but macam kalau if you put it in term macam macam kita as a human punya equality
macam diri kita sendiri macam tak kisah orang tu race tu apa what is his race but logically like if you murder sama macam aku seorang you have
macam it's logic for someone to kena gantung ke
macam you murder someone
logically who kena gantung this is like um like the basic macam law that we know lah but
I don't know what derives dia punya court macam kasih conditional warning see the word conditional warning
a'ah so preposterous gila pergi beijing
I saw I go nampak yang punya news nanti
like they tweeted about the story pasal this thing ah
sekarang macam malaysia dah ada lot of cases like
a spike seh dia orang punya
like tiba-tiba kesian kesian lah
tak yang macam ada yang aku nampak tak pakai mask ada yang pakai so it's like aku rasa orang tu macam tak consistent lah
um itu cluster
ya betul betul wei ya dia ni macam pasal donald trump
dia punya anak punya anak kena COVID nineteen
anak donald trump kena COVID nineteen the fourteen years old punya yes
like so sad he's in rally macam
pathetic punya situation aku gelak gila
lepas tu like
macam kesian lah dia sekarang cakap K aku I read this news
they said that donald trump declares said dah balik daripada COVID nineteen
sebab dia nak sebab dia nak masuk election macam dia nak buat campaign
four more minutes lagi empat minutes
oh tahan
cepat lah please
aku rasa kan kita akan fail kita punya first try
no I think that use moment english but I use one malay so aku tak tahu like is like the same
uh takpe lah takpe lah
it's okay at least kita cuba and get the experience
I would say aku pernah kerja sekali hari ini satu kali
towkay towkay oh ya aku nak cari kau
aku try ini like small business yang buat macam
small business um bag ke sebab aku tengah cari small business untuk collaborate for open a giveaway
like aku nak support dia orang lah
okay I don't know I mean I mean ah oh kalau kau kena kena giveaway prize apa
kalau it's you prize apa yang kau nak
sebab aku ah apa tu
aku dapat satu semua besok satu kalau besok dia just started
so macam aku nak ini di situ saya turun orang so it's like a phone case punya business
kejap okay tak apa if he were to send you a gift that is a bloody portrait
kalau betul lah eh tiba-tiba kau dengan dia together malay malay if kalau betul kau dengan dia together
dah dah dah dah that's right err
and the flirting turns into like is a conversation how I talk to all my other friends so kalau if if kalau kau tengah berbual dengan dia and kau kau macam just cakap
eh kau kelakar seh aku suka berbual dengan kau
ya exactly so why you not talking to me that is a flirt you leave the person like eh siala why she talk like that she want me flirt to her ah oo la la so that's when kalau kau dah cakap macam asal kau tak berbual dengan aku ya exactly kau tak nak berbual aku pe kau busy sangat pe I'm not that important
okay dengar dulu so after you're in a relationship that after that your partner if they say is it weird dah dah dah
no tak when you meet him
like gap lah macam he probably thinks that kau macam lagi kaya or some shit like that right
I know prior to that he keep saying macam
acting eh macam kau self-realisation padahal tak ada apa-apa habuk pun takde
no like is it like macam is it
oh my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder atau uh Okcupid
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of um naive girls because you really really go through macam
to to the tee punya macam this one really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
amin abeh amin
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say tak nak kau you won't kau tak akan break up dengan mata air kau just to lepak dengan budak syafiq ni that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say ah buat apa
because I don't like you atau you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money aku kasi uh I aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit
atau dia bagi kau knowledge dia tak bagi kau opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to lepak
would would not get mad with you meh he will get mad what pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
if syafiq keeps telling you eh lepak ah lepak ah lepak ah when the first meeting problem starts with eh I didn't before sia there's there's gonna be this part of like
I would say because dia very religious kan kau just cakap macam just playfully flirt lah macam
things that make him feel like oh she really wants my attention like eh kau tak berbual dengan aku eh dah lama tak rindu seh or something like that so
it's not haram what I mean okay it is haram because you have the intention but then
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like macam step uh apa ni eh uh like you can flirt lah but then like
faham tak it's so many red flags sorry but
I would further macam I would pursue him
faham tak so bila kau dah macam together dengan dia not not if let's say he starts to
like it's either you are a good boy atau you are manipulative
for real huh dia hantar you portrait kimak budak-budak kental pe sia confirm aku cakap dengan kau
you kena cheated also eh we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
pukiwek three years abeh kena cheated eh siala
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like macam
kawan aku legit bila aku kecil-kecil kan dia memang betul religious habis the family and very baik so
shy baik and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary lah for you to just macam socialise what
she's the type that don't even wear tudung depan uh pakcik makcik
so legit eh ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung that kind of thing atau macam
eh uh berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut so when when she go out with these kind of uh men uh
um pasal everyday they remind themselves ah oh jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk that's fucking true let's be real macam and and that's why to me
in my head is like um if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and haram is not for you
kau masih nak try try try tapi kau tak up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is um
how do I say this ah everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so macam
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu so if she she say she don't want it then kalau um
he should know better what right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch sia this is not like macam remeh-temeh girl tau it's not like macam
for me to and not because like eh aku no no no I mean my gift alhamdulillah is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man faham tak
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like macam you're going through a lot of uh problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like eh family aku my family is uh uh poor I mean uh mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah
itu aku boleh bagi ah tapi buto kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like macam
and like macam I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
uh I'm blinded that was the one yang dengan the arab guy that I was with yang macam aku betul-betul sayang but dia macam
like dalam islam pun cakap a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so cakap dengan dia gitu maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that kalau kau nak macam if you play by insecurity saying that aiya aku tahu lah aku ni buruk aku tahu lah
and then diam lah sial macam do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that kena burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like macam ya so
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry aku macam really that's that's weird
it's weird ah macam
how to say ah it's weird it's weird unless kau macam
fan mail then legit kena call fan sia fan I also want to vomit sia huh kau fanatic dia ni when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
no you should tell him straight ah eh kimak kau lame pe kau hantar perempuan gini that means before aku kau hantar perempuan apa eh macam tiba-tiba
what the fuck do you do with your free time kau scroll perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar portrait
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh steady punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka
once you date me you die already you die already all my my macam bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already what I'm abusive what back then lah you know like I don't give a like bro aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak sia muka kau pun aku boleh pecah kan sia and as a guy also
who the fuck macam owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father lah but not your partner faham tak so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like kau dah mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy masuk jail cakap once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn eh
that is weird let's see kalau kau betul-betul cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet ah
faham tak cause
ya so that's why aku cakap kau it it all takes time what people especially when you like someone bro
and you've never been he been been uh at his lowest point of uh point in his life have you ever be that kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak
you fucking tell me engkau then apa diam ah sial then you want you have a better goal lah like it's simple as that macam
uh that that that that's where I play my game faham tak of like
I pick my battle lah macam okay this guy is enough for me
tell you before leh fuck bro kimak aku punya boyfriend dulu eh perempuan hantar dia macam
eh I saw you around school you look cute aku maki sia buto siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok you buat apa dia pasal what
asal kau you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
bapa aku sia nama bapa aku sial
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you kalau
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence punya
wait but then saturday sunday kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia
okay ya then then just hang with them like macam you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
stop it like macam if you tell your if tell your oh my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before macam
oh I went out with this girl I tak pernah I tak pernah
dia gila-gila kan I tapi I tak pernah uh apa ni
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that oh this girl got got macam
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that lah but he said as like macam okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I simplicate whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
you want to fucking go out with her because she got connection because she can give you some sort of like macam um
help with ke apa lan jiao
go ahead with it or whatever kalau macam nak tanya advice about macam kerja in the future ke apa go ahead with it but I'm not
like macam is not more of like macam oh I reciprocate back
so right now you are reciprocating back if your boyfriend were to tell you in the future you ada keluar dengan dia tak you pernah keluar dengan dia tak I was fond of him lah
tapi I tak pernah mata air dengan dia
I can safely say that because I went out with a guy that fucking cheated kena cheated three times still fucking stupid
ah aku pun nak terkencing so how many more
so you telling me I want to belanja you or what
motherfucker aku nak patah balik I need to go back
tak boleh lah you cannot be distracted
oh they cakap that she probably want to get a divorce suddenly so deep ah
it became forty minutes what the hell and then I like sesat sia I was like so I was so stressed I scared simon angry cause I make I always make him wait
like what if he marah at me and he doesn't want to hang out with us anymore
uh he's kinda mad at me about that like merajuk he merajuk he kata
like cause during the weekends err weekdays tak dapat jumpa then weekend also like I also busy
we were hang up till five and then uh I went home and then I woke up at like twelve then I called him and ask him if he wanted to come along and he say ya he wants to come along but he says but he's like half-awake so I was like never mind lah you just sleep I'll go with sharinah and simon and then after that I tell him lah then after that I want to do my school stuff abeh he macam like upset
then I also macam like annoyed lah pasal he yesterday he cakap he nak hantar you know like he want to fetch me and send me here like and then last minute he say like last minute he like still sleeping then I like ah fuck it lah I'm just going go myself then I don't know so that was a bad start to the day
no lah I tell him already I I sampai then he never reply
oh oh there's one the nice one the one the dua tingkat right
what's what does simon want to do nak buat apa
then you kena tunggu ah how long was the simulation
ah that's not bad tak tunggu lama ah
I mean even when you're not influenced even if you're not drunk tak mabuk you still cannot predict what that's so funny
cause they already like nak masakkan you then is that it
you makan apa seh kat situ azizi still got
he buncit already meh
ah pasal dia punya percentage for exams is the they um turunkan for exams so they put it at every other uh like assignments quizzes so they increase the percentage there so it's heavier for the assignment than quizzes it used to be like five percent now the quizzes are like ten percent that's whole grade leh babe
so like I have to do properly lah then I taking I taking four modules sia babe like fucking busy I'm so sorry for saying that word but but I'll be so busy tak ada time
ya so I'm telling aqil like I'm gonna be busy I tak ada time for him sometimes like for during the weekdays
he gets it tapi dia pun sedih ah sometimes
ah dia macam kalau I boleh buat you pun boleh buat gitu ah
ya I think gitu ah
lain ah lain I cannot sia like he that time he also he only one module lah then I got four modules
cause the other day he was asking me eh err do you have lobang for like then it's like aiya syrinah boleh cari sendiri ah but like you know the previous place I worked at the dyslexia association of singapore they they paying quite high oh now lah
ya it's macam learning centre punya timing ah but it's lepak ah the job is it's damn lepak
no babe it will like strain your body sia then you want to have baby camne nak have a baby if you're gonna be tired all the time
then you can just hantar him lah
tinggal mana seh babe
that's so freaking far from dari bishan pergi choa chu eh pergi his ah camp is kat mana
like you beg her that's what I would do I would pujuk her I'll cium her kaki sia to kasi the bilik
it's like girl I'll get you an iphone and ipad anything you want just let me have the room five days a week you just live in the hall for five days a week a few nights a week and then on the weekends you can have it wah susah sia tak ada rumah sendiri I swear it's damn hard
wah then must tahan like this for satu tahun
no wonder simon kata want to get his own car the other day
it's not cheap sia babe tu hari I tolong top up kan aqil punya minyak cause he was driving me around so I offered to bayar for the minyak ah I only kasi fifty dollars and it's like
what the hell it's so mahal sia their minyak the fuel consumptions is like shit
it's mahal as shit man I swear it's like honestly bike
like I I tengok also if like
and it's all the way at the lim chu kang there sia what bus will pergi sana
tak payah lah oh my god you know what I think right it's a good thing that you're not working right now because you can like hantar simon
sleep in or you know not the one to trouble you but kesian sia he he like I also will think like
but it's only like um august september october november lima lima bulan jer tinggal then after that you guys can like like breathe a little right
the doa the berkat the berkat from the family like you know like another I don't know lah to me doesn't matter as long as got I don't need my makciknya berkat it's okay god sees me and god loves me so that's fine
I feel like as long as ya I feel like if you're pregnant tak yah sudah it's like forgo the whole idea but since you're not pregnant you know planning planning
right so are they agreeable to return you the duit after kalau in december tak boleh hold a wedding are they going to return the money
but that like dengki sia
oh masih tu ah
I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything tau you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to uh and then you also include like you you um macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how sia you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects lah like you still going to lose money sia
and at this time leh macam
macam like you lost thousands of money eh just because like orh the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
it's not even your fault sia it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been uh how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
I told aqil I had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin ah but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time ah cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi I tak nak macam okay I need to find a man yang I boleh kahwin no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will uh fall into place lah like if if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately I feel like uh it's important that aqil and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting ah of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan ah
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi um
so he say ah like let's celebrate or officiate um hujung tahun
tapi kan babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I nak tengok your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all ugh in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
oh right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I macam oh then he cakap ah actually dia dah start saving like he's very uh thrifty like
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
then I was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish I um
I know like I know he's an adult like I know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
so like I was so sure of hassan ah I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him oh my god okay I nak bilang you something ah yesterday yesterday semalam I told aqil this I say I cakap dengan aqil um
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things um tertulis ah lah like is everything tertulis what like
belum I belum delete I still I still masih ada kat phone
dekat my phone
kenapa I tak tahu I tak tahu asal I tak delete
I I tak nak tengok ah the gambar-gambar like it makes
kau nak but
that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
lepas tu um dah kahwin after a few after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
cakap melayu lah okay so itu saja tentang hassan
ah tentang hassan dan aqil
oh I still macam sedih seh you and simon tak pergi honeymoon
the thing yang I akan look forward to right
thai pancake sedap dok thai pancake
ya but krabi punya water activities mm lame juga ah
I nak ikut I nak ikut mak dan ayah
tak boleh itu honeymoon
okay abeh atas I tell my parents I go with you then over there we separate
then kat sana kita separate
kalau pergi krabi
ah ah kita I tell
I tell my parents that I go dengan you then kat kat sana then I separate lah dengan aqil lah
no tapi nak buat like you can do your own things boleh buat benda sendiri boleh
lepak jer water activities makan lepak
you don't like macam buat activity
tapi macam sightseeing pergi like hiking pergi like um visit temples and shit
I'm okay to like shop like maybe half a day or like two hours or three hours kalau the whole day nak pergi shopping I boring seh like bosan gila
macam restless as err especially if like I tak cause I don't really like shop much
if I don't have anything that I like then boring gila seh
I feel like kita should go
buat anak dekat bali
uh kalau kita empat pergi bali aqil dengan I kita pergi uh ee kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
orh yesterday um we saw aqil ah class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend oh my god the girlfriend cantik gila sia I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like uh ya melayu but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like macam like I say hi ah but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then aqil was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
because right babe when we duduk in the car aqil need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
I am not complaining ah cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I tak complain lah pasal I pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so up to you lah you nak on aircon I okay jer you nak waste nak waste gas
but I think one thing that I need to like um get used to is dia punya cemburu
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila I cakap pasal like my guy friends or like shah shah sia shah is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam oh maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
like to me it's like uh old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that one I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything lah between you
I punya timer five three two eight
orh pasal aqil tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard ah to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like oof damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full lah
so macam
especially practising muslim so macam like ah but macam I have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian ah like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like I don't wanna ya so like macam oh okay like that's your view too
gasak kau lah nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so I tak kesah ah dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa I nak tegur you know
so I think part yang dia like in terms of I'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on aqil like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will I scared they feel like aqil is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair lah pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I yang nak kahwin pe
I think my my parents punya fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life lah like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
macam tak sincere jer
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning lah like properly macam
apply for house then like um because aqil just started working so his is tak banyak
I feel like I feel like aqil is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia tau dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe
a'ah lama seh tak jumpa
my work cancel ah pasal COVID
tengah cari kerja ah ah
because dulu I kerja macam
events gitu lah then events semua macam
tak ada events gitu so
tak apa lah
ada skillsfuture semua you know
um dekat ah yang lain semua mahal ah
you sekolah apa ah
I uh that time I a bit scared ah because macam COVID still a lot kan
ya tak tak keluar tak kerja tak anything
eh you kerja apa again
oh gitu
irritating kan macam kerja berat sangat gitu nak buat like you know
tak ada mood eh
duduk office right ya a'ah
but either way I don't like to work at home then your your your school pun home based juga ke apa
always all the way like that ke pasal COVID
I'm already malas because like the first
two month you know circuit breaker I really tak keluar rumah
then uh ya then after that then it was so hard to go out again macam
tak tak jadi circuit breaker circuit baker tak
siapa kisah uh nevermind lah like that time I was so bored
like I make the the you know the brown sugar pearl then the dalgona coffee semua I make
tak ada kerja ah
ya tapi tak jadi ah some some some okay some
ya some success then some is like macam
tak jadi ah then I'm try to make apam balik but it's like
not that nice like pasar malam kind
tak apa ah
oh wow but I don't like to order kat luar because like
actually I eat macam benda yang tak halal ah macam no pork no lard I just makan you know
ya lah ya lah like kalau keluar kan boleh like choose whatever I want to eat you know
apa tinggal mana ang mo kio
oh ya that one also aku ada story
eh but jurong okay what I don't know I mean at least when I go there kan macam
a whole new world for me ah like macam tak biasa at all ah but then ya I used to like cause I was thinking macam jurong kan ada
banyak ah ya so it's like whenever I go there then tak tau nak makan apa ya so
ya maybe that's why we never like meet each other because you always there but then you go town a lot kan kerja and school
tak keluar juga ya lah ya lah
uh you know mister teh tarik gitu ah
gitu lah
rajin like more rajin in the kitchen right
then my mum was like oh bila nak kahwin you know things like that
I tempted you know because recently dia orang kata uh like
majlis like only ten people or something
ya apa ni
but you attached or tak
I see some of the comments kat facebook kan dia orang kata macam
dah dah dah lima then groomsmen like lagi lima orang
that's why then I was like patut lah
ya then they were like macam bising ah like uh
uh with my majlis perkahwinan then I'm just like
tak tak faham ah
tak tahu ah the name semua macam sama gitu I don't know ya
you boleh drive tak
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like oh hi welcome to apa apa apa you know then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask what then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous ke apa lah
you don't want to tegur like that then you just like alamak dia ni lagi then
oh oh ya ya ya ya ya ya betul tak tak sombong ah nanti dia cakap sombong then you know cause usually never wear wear the mask then they'll be like
uh eh you very sombong eh sekarang like then I'm like
you penat kerja then you just like you know zone out and then you just walk home or something but then sometimes I bumped into them then I never see then dia orang kata I like macam
sekarang dah sombong eh what what what then I'm just like what you know so
now wear mask bedek-bedek oh tak perasan lah like you know like ya but I understand what you mean by rimas also I think that one is just because singapore is hot
nak snow tak nak ah that one kiamat already
actually I don't know whether I want to still work with them I like recently I got like macam change of heart
dah tua ah like macam tiring ah events
my friend dia nak jadi temperature screener kan dekat kedai tu kan
then dia orang kata mesti ada diploma then I'm like
susah sangat ke temperature screener you know like apa seh
tak makes sense ah I think dia orang macam sengaja nak
buat susah you know then they complain like you know oh nobody want to apply padahal
tapi the people like freaking toxic seh then I cannot take it then I just like say like I don't want to come back
kerja apa uh teaching
ah tak but I got um biasa ah tuition experience and like you know
I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom gitu
ya then apa lagi eh uh
ya then now also like nak classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like macam
every hour kena sanitise gitu ah like ugh
then macam malas gitu ah
ya but this one dia toxic ah the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay lah cuma the management ah like macam
ngada-ngada ah I don't know how to say
then like the first three days the management tak datang so I'm like okay ah this job like not bad ah I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like macam
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but boleh lah can manage lah you know not so
um tengok how I work lah you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then dia orang
ya she damn cari pasal ah like with me like semua benda yang I buat which I think is like
not even her problem dia macam tak okay
then I like malas already then ya then like
if I know everything why I training right like bodoh pe perempuan ni
uh then then I know what he what they she roughly mean ah I don't get like everything but I boleh faham sikit-sikit ah
aku baru then aku tak tahu apa-apa you know things like that then I'm like
or is it the next day or something like that then she like tegur me ah she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like eh kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa then kau orang nak test aku
I know how to do lah gitu so I managed to pass the test lah then she was like okay actually um I think you can
uh you don't know anything so I uh that time I'm just like malas seh nak datang balik
you want kira work from home ah I don't want seh
but then now I I see like macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay lah I guess
my friends semua macam introvert dengan homebody juga so it was quite fun lah for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other macam
you ask them to jumpa right like like
too wild too long in that's why I'm like macam
but then my parents dia orang macam nak my sis my younger sister to marry first
tak ah I think my relationship longer but my relationship uh I'm also attached to a non-muslim
ya it makes things more complicated ah I guess then my sister she macam
she attached dengan muslim guy so that's already one
macam sekarang right I was thinking like is it
marriage is just like macam
eh but then you know what so scary leh like macam
um recently kan I baca kat
facebook ah now now got a lot of free time what so more time to browse facebook gitu semua
wah then ah so if cause to me right macam kalau kita relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
need lawyer need to sign things all macam ugh malas ah
uh tak I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know rajin-rajin in the kitchen then dia orang macam
oh um izzati finally can get married gitu you know but then I'm just like
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much kalau tahu I just
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun lah but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant gitu you know
like chiongster also lah kerja banyak and things like that then my parents also not happy ah because like
supposedly twenty five kita kena dah married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off lah
mm mm betul lah then what huh
kita pun ada cakap ah like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
then she say it's like hell lah because the mother in-law macam
like have a lot of expectations of her gitu
but sometimes kecoh is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of kecoh
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she cakap dia tak nak ah she nak cari rumah sendiri juga
like you know hari raya you pergi like rumah kat jurong then mesti ada kucing punya I don't know ah I don't know how to say ya
I never say ah bukan aku cakap eh
oh pergi pasir ris then I oh pergi changi okay then pergi jurong ah I
seram seh
oh but recently my sister kena then I was like what the hell
a bit overconfident lah dia orang kata
so so it's like I'm like oi uh why you follow me like you know padahal I'm just a
sometimes dia orang will follow from a distance which I can still like macam
buat bodoh lah you know then
there was one guy who even like macam
naik kan then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
and actually because I want to lean ah because I malas
recently kan I feel like macam I want to move to the west side because
ya so it's like macam I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
life you know like sometimes the the kerja is like so far away from your rumah then it's like ugh malas ya
so ya lah ya lah macam I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't uh what
ya lah cause in ang mo kio like macam nobody ever sleeps
then sometimes like three kan ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon then dia orang ketawa like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
because he also still studying then he want to like uh like what you say lah macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu
sebab dia nak jadi teacher so now he studying the subject
because he wants to work at punya kind of school
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't kerja you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
say before that he is macam
like when he got school kan dia nak
uh but then that semester break it I think is is macam charity
that's why just like normal expenditure kan it's not like saving for a house gitu you know
ah cina lah
I was workaholic also lah then macam
whatever lah actually I was kind of those kind like oh I I independent woman I tak nak kahwin tak nak
ada children all then in the end
saje jer like you know like
try try cause nowadays got macam banyak apps gitu lah you know and websites also
so just make friends ah because I feel like macam
my age kan like orang semua dah kahwin then dia orang macam tak nak hang out so much
I suddenly meet him then suddenly like eh macam eh actually like if we get married and have a life together macam fun gitu juga eh ya so

I had a lot of assignments dengan to complete and it was really nerve wrecking for my internship cause it was at a hospital lah
tapi in all I guess my poly life was quite fun and interestin
mm aku tak tahu ah macam mana nak bagi kau tips but because like it really depends on your course since I was in biomed kan more of my assignment was more into like theory based punya</malay
tengok kalau aku nak bagi kau tips pun aku rasa tak manfaat kot cause kau pernah bilang aku that your course is design righ
err I'm currently working full time at P&G as lab analyst dekat</malay
it's a microbiology lab ah so called kau akan buat testing to like you know facial products and shit like that penat sia kerja I mean like there's there was a lockdown right like during the COVID perio
mm aku actually actually planning untuk sambung sekolah cause aku rasa righ
oh aku tak tahu that your sister was in because I'm planning to go to juga um as a part time student in biomedical engineering cours
aku rasa part time student is the best for me right no
mm pelik kau punya cousin boleh pecahkan kau punya specs sia
mm maybe lah if I got time err in the future and maybe I have enough money aku temankan kau buat specs lah cause I feel like I also need specs my degree also keep increasin
mm we can't really go outside unless they are for like necessities and stuff like that ya rindu seh keluar dengan kawan semua especially karaok
mm like I say limited places sebab like some places pukul sepuluh dah tutup seh so macam</malay
ya that sounds like a good plan tapi like as I said mm semua orang pun busy aku pun busy juga since I'm looking full tim
um ahead kau nak pergi staycation err
kau ada ke hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
mm actually that place one pun bagus juga ah I went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre period like before circuit perio
kalau ada room service pun baik juga</malay
mm talking about shangri la I came across the article dekat apa tu the smart local if I'm not wrong pasal the shangri la
I don't know lah it's entirely up to you I don't know I also don't know when the promo ends also I aku rasa it's end of this septembe
tak salah aku ah
aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat shangri la how was the place like I know my friend work there before but has
he said the food there nice lah but tak halal lah
mm ya maybe we should ah but we really have to plan well I guess I mean kalau tak boleh staycation pun I guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit I have a list of it lah maybe I ca
ya I remember pemalas malas nak jalan oh I remember that cafe I think it's like hot chicks or somethin
aku recommend kau pergi I mean we we can go to cat cafe dekat rail mal
very cute kau boleh main dengan kucing while you like have your dessert or some stuff mm cause I saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad lah it's affordable and other than tha
the mind cafe is just like macam apa ni you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu
uh uh mm maybe can ajak ayu also ah bu
pelik it's weird ah I scared I'm awkward with her I mean you you're closer with her I guess I don't kno
I mean ya lah aku tahu during secondary school I was a nerd lah cause I was really focusing on like you know finishing my O's going poly and shit s
I mean I had a I I mean I talk to guys during that period but I don't think dating was an option cause I mean you look at our school lah lelaki semua pecah sia
let's be honest can't they're I mean they are not pecah but they're not like you know nice people so I rather not be attached to the
I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online lah for me ah cause aku rasa kalau if show everything online nanti kalau kau orang break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing it's weird I I don't know how you all do it like kau orang just post pictures of each other and stuff like that I'll I'll feel weird doing that I guess it's just not me ah
a few days you can come to work kan macam tak fair seh kau tak akan earn tak akan apa ni hold duit yang cukup untuk sekolah and for your own like needs sebab aku tengok kau design kau selalu macam</malay
kena pakai printers semua untuk print kau punya project so tu semua pakai duit sia
huh someone got fired who sia siapa seh what happen I'm curiou
tak baik seh manager too I mean she's doing baking what is she suppose to split herself int
apa eh orang kata be mor
flexible I guess like if she's really busy baking for the shit right I mean baking for like you know the breads and stuff like that then like at least her as a manager she can handle the cashier what tak salah pe asal dia macam gini sia tak faham seh
on with that kind of salary plus um aku ada bilang kau ke tak yang aku punya matair sekarang tengah kerja temperature taking righ
dia punya his pay also got cut like previously it was twelve dollars right but now they cut it to eight fift
really face this kind of people like kesian ah juga cause of this like COVID thing right so they had to hire people for like temperature screener but some people are jus
safe entry damn leceh leh huh must walk one round ah just to go to the entrance I mean like it's for your own safety also gila ah
gila</malay
gila sia this kind of people like tak ikut rules abeh yang like they they are they they are the one who's doing something wrong abeh kita orang pula yang salah but it is what it is lah what can we d
you blah blah blah but I don't know don't really like ikut sangat cakap orang</malay
in short overall everything will work out fine anyways aku dengar after your interview kau keluar dengan kawan kau kan pergi mana jer merayap jer kerja</malay
like he pay for your stuff and he didn't do anything creep like that ustaz who is a creeper don't know why you go out with those kind of guys also those disgustin
plus sixteen ex is quite a lot so what does that mean he he matair for like two months habis tu break then another girlfriend is it sixteen banyak sia
just focus focus on yourself lah lagipun kau lagi muda there are other things for you to worry about like your school and your career there's a lot of things in front of you you have to achieve before you know finding the right on
pelik ah
age is not an issue ah because um kawan aku I have this friend ah my friend he's working together with me right no
age tak kisah seh I mean kalau kau lagi ada macam semangat kau nak sambung sekolah and you have the time why no
but I tell him the more he delay the more he procrastinate until when seh dia nak ambil like nak finish the degree then he was like and I've I also advised him lah lik
mm tak habis-habis go jer part time rabak</malay
a'ah I guess he just need to time have proper time management ah but aku dah tengok dia punya schedule dia punya modules and stuff like that I mean in short while if got wheels things will go on smoothly lah but I mea
aku lapar sia kau lapar</malay
ya kau asyik makan apa sia I do you have you tried the burnt cheesecak

perangai gemuk sia
ya sia burnt I heard also about that burnt cheesecake sia it's like two months for you to get what's like one damn cheesecake that's like I mean it's worth it lah if you think about it because it's nice but the waiting time is gila wei tak boleh</malay
basic B A S Q tak salah aku okay lah it's affordable for one whole cheesecake and it's like not bad but I don't like it because it's very hard I like it when it melts in your mouth but this one cam</malay

melayu eh
mostly all chinese I think so melayu pun aku tak tengok
K ada satu jer aku tengok
apa eh
tujuh hari eh tujuh hari mencintai mu is it
aku rasa lah aku pun tak sure
serious satu jer
satu jer the rest I don't like it
dulu what
dulu kita tengok drama together what because there is timing for it what
kan aku pun selalu tengok suratkhabar just to tengok apa show yang ada for the day
and bila nak buka and bila tak payah buka at all
aku tengok that this one facebook post I think aku pun lupa bila
like that's when dia orang tahu that perempuan is actually lelaki they went for
they went for service punya
ya I mean in singapore it's called other countries I don't know but for service ni
seriously dia orang semua like most of the guys seriously they really look like a freaking girl
aku seriously seh
macam dah pernah eh
I mean mostly of my friends who have tunang
siapa boleh kasi aku attention wise
aku faham aku faham tapi kaucara kau cakap is like
because it's very different it's very different bila kau tengok eh everything it's all scripted what
that's why it relieves your stress level bila kau tengok cerita tu
cam kau get excited
so ada so ada voting punya ni lah
tak semua I watch bondi rescue
kau tau eh aku tengok that bondi rescue thirteen season it's to the point that aku cakap ngan mak aku nak jadi lifeguard
uh bondi rescue is like mm kau lifeguard so basically you just jaga this beach kau
no they are just on their job basis so basically this cameramen just come in just shooting their everyday punya
no but you know it's very how to say ah macam
macam dia puaskan hati kau tau yang bila diorang actually
inspire me ya something like that because aku tengok kan this one season kan they diorang fail to apa tu uh save this couple tau old couple
they are in their seventies kalau tak salah aku they only managed to save
dia ada tiga orang this couple dengan lagi satu diorang punya kirakan in-laws lah
kirakan adik ipar is it aku pun tak sure
ah betul lah abang ipar lah tu
melayu fail
so basically diorang bila diorang dah save this tiga orang kan no diorang save satu aje dahulu because lifeguards kat situ empat orang in duty
three of them just go there and save kalau ada orang drown lagi how
diorang nangis actually because they couldn't save
diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu kan
aku nangis because aku tengok diorang actually trying to revive that that couple back
really diorang really like went all out
betul ah
that's why they cry because they try so hard tapi they try to actually macam cover themself up ah because diorang tahu kan diorang being
tapi banyak orang like surrounding diorang macam like kind of like macam blaming them for not doing their job properly macam couldn't rescue them on time
kau imagine eh kerja kau as a lifeguard kau ada empat like only four of you and you expect them to rescue all of you who are drowing which is to me pada aku is just so sad
oh kesian kan
kan that's why aku I wanted to be at that one point of time ah because aku really aku admire diorang punya how to say ah macam diorang punya semangat untuk kerja
kau tahu eh after that that three lifeguard eh two lifeguard took a long leave because they were was ah because they were affected by that thingy
abeh ada satu lagi that one episode before diorang habis tu season
yang satu budak ni actually dia carik bapa dia tau for three hours kat beach tu beach tu memang besar gila ah
dia ada north south
ah K basically K you get the point lah eh dia punya laut besar
dia cari bapa dia tiga jam pastu last dia pergi that tower where all the lifeguard is there dia cakap uh apa aku tengah cari bapa aku boleh tak buat announcement
yang kau tahu yang this one lifeguard actually cakap yang tadi aku try save this one old lady
aku try to save this one guy but then by the time aku sampai kepala dia dah takde
ya he wasn't sure at all itu orang ke batu
tak save because dia tak tak boleh cari
because diorang save is pakai board tau
pakai diorang diorang sendiri swim
surfing surfing board tu diorang sendiri pergi
K lah after that bila budak tu patah balik eh diorang punya mindset is all the lifeguard kalau selagi takde datang kat sini cari orang kirakan itu is batu bukan orang it's a good thing
dia tak move then after that bila budak tu datang dia cakap aku dah cari bapa aku dah tiga jam
semua orang got called out because they had to do a search in that laut
they they went there for holiday but then it ended up and the saddest thing is kau tahu on that day he died it was his birthday
aku nangis aku seriously mak dia dah pengsan anak dia dah kirakan nak jadi the strong pillar for the mother
he just stand there ah just wait for someone to actually bawak body dia masuk
aku emotional lah
itu dah lama seh
eh but diorang punya joke is very far how to say eh it's very
kau nak kene really like tangkap that to to actually understand
it's kelakar pada aku kelakar gila no okay dia punya joke is very
kau nak kene really understand
what if you watch properly you will understand that diorang punya joke is really mendalam
cam it's just inside joke
kalau if you get it you laugh if you don't get it you dont laugh you know that kind of shit
pada aku lah it's fun lah
aku kecik-kecik aku takde dreams seh

what happened to them ah actually dia orang gaduh

alah sedihnya
lelaki eh kau fikir
laki aku lah dia suka
I think after six months you already dah dah dah tak kisah ya
feelings balik
they'll I don't know what what power lah okay but macam dia orang they have like this mindset right that they okay anything I say or anything I do confirm girls confirm girls will fall for it
aku dah cakap lah dia dia kalau comfortable dengan orang tu dia dia selalu buat gitu
adik kau pilih si izuan ke ah dia cakap eh kau ni bapak kau tak lawa tak handsome ke macam
I don't know why many people many girls find izuan handsome termasuk kau but
I don't know it's just me even elfie cakap tau ya ya oi that time aku tanya dia eh
eh iya ke jazli and izuan handsome
then dia kata a'ah not bad why abeh dia cakap dia orang handsome ke because most girls find find them handsome
kau jangan wei sembilan belas ada yang dah tunang sia
dua puluh satu dah nak kahwin seh
I mean some other way kau boleh macam
if the feelings hilang already what
his one right I think his type of like macam
convincing or talk or apa apa ah in general
his type is to like macam lead you on
okay macam okay
humairah said that he still like macam cakap to you cakap
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he tak itu
so jangan don't don't think that that is the end of the world also
mm cheat juga so it's two ways
tak nak tanya lah
toxic bodoh
oh mana aku tahu aku ingatkan perempuan tu
you can't K the thing is kau tak boleh expect like a guy to look so great
cause that's when you know macam kau kau confirm tak boleh dapat
you know it's not their hati yang gatal it's bawah dia orang gatal
terus dia reject
kau reject eh
oh ya kau tolak eh kau cakap I I'm still moving on
I think he said because kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua kan zack is the opposite what that's why he feels like very competitive gitu dia tak suka
alah kesiannya you but did you tell him that
kau cakap apa dalam letter tu
comelnya okay
you should just tell him that kau orang together not because your expectation of a guy is
macam you should say that at least he tried it's easier
oh dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat
okay I mean dia tak teruk seteruk aku tau but
kawan pun boleh eventually turn out to be so
that's that is the beauty of like having friends lah itu jer
selenge aku ketuk kau kan kepala ke kau kau cakap pasal si zack depan-depan dia sia
aku I was like laughing behind the screen I was like I want to look at izuan's reaction
ya tapi dalam hati tu mesti sakit padan muka
ya lah okay you're you're moving on two months dia dah break up dengan kau two months
it's kenal-kenal
guys who kenal-kenal me also
you know that day yang kita pergi hantar kereta
it's me humairah dengan lagi tiga ekor tu

abeh kau cakap oh tomorrow I have the meeting
ya then after that kau cakap kita cakap okay do well for your meeting
yang meeting yang interview tu kau cakap lepas tu tiba-tiba aku text kau kau cakap oh my my interview was err last err is next week aku macam
very blur aku sepak actually at the end of the day aku tanya kau kau nak ikut besok
nine nine six nine apa
then the queue was like panjang
no no err kita kita semua naik nine six nine balik ya ya umirah then after that no we were queueing kan
then sekali err two of us were walking in front
sekali yang kat belakang tu tertinggal then got other people then them ah lepas tu aku dengan humairah tengah cakap cakap ah I I wasn't talking I was on my handphone
then aku cakap err not really just cakap cakap jer
because I got the dating app also then after that err dia cakap I asked her back lah you have boyfriend before
dia kata if I'm not wrong dia cakap err
that guy the guy yang kerja dengan dia kat tu
yes she told me she told me about his macam apa cakap oh dia dulu budak madrasah and stuff like that
then after that err dan mak dia tak suka humairah
ya and then after that I was like I was so shocked lah like mak dia tak suka
like the girl dia punya ex gaduh dengan gaduh ya I'm like
ya exactly it's not her what humairah madrasah ke takkan alim jer
you know that a guy from madrasah
suka dengan budak madrasah yang lagi satu then I'm like
but but look like at the kids yang dah pernah madrasah even if I don't know they have done it
K but very annoyed itu cerita lain ke
I literally gave up you know when he said that aku macam tak nak gaduh lah diam jer lah
he said what layer layer layer aku cakap am I not layering that one
feel uncomfortable ah like macam
okay it's not it's not bad that he tegur but tegur tu like
cakap baik-baik not not say
it's not his tone it's the way he say it he macam cakap can you not wear like that macam gitu
nanti lelaki will think otherwise that one that that one I don't mind
if he says like that I don't mind but he says as if I'm the I'm the macam I'm the one wrong
tu pasal aku dah macam marah that's why I was pissed
aku dah cakap apa terang-terang like kau nak pakai itu kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu then it's not my problem
aku pun pissed gila wei gitu dengar
I don't know we were talking about oh no kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik
lepas tu aku tanya dia like husni was like talking because kita tiga jer kan dah biasa
then after that we just talk ah macam
err we need to talk about like macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia emo gitu
lepas tu aku bilang lah dia orang macam apa jadi
like as in apa jadi as in like uh why is she still feeling sad lah gitu
then aku just cakap in my opinion I think
dia masih belum move on gitu ya then after that ya
mm and then lepas tu
husni cakap maybe
err husni came to a conclusion he just said that um
because like uh that is why you shouldn't play dating app ni semua
ya then after that aku macam it's like aku cakap ah macam sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person itu jer
for fun also what kau nak kenal-kenal orang jer pe
tell me that uh takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga tau lelaki ni semua tak bagus
then after that aku cakap lah aku cakap dengan dia like uh the guy I talking to that irfan
I told him that about that guy ah macam mana dia cakap dengan aku gitu
husni cakap ya just um next time just be careful jer lah
then kata aku cakap um
aku bilang husni ah aku tanya dia in my in your opinion lah do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
pasal tu husni cakap no you cannot see anything what
it's just one line dah tu jer
wah it'll it will trigger me right if he say that dulu kau pakai tutup aurat lepas tu kau pakai gini
tak he never say that before but if he says it that I'm gonna flip out sia
and the thing yang aku pakai tadi kan baju tu kan yang colour purple you cannot see anything what
ya it's just the ke belakang what
pasal dia tak berani nak cakap apa-apa that's why
kirakan apa birthday surprise dia bodoh
buka buka gitu birthday surprise
lupakan jer aku tak kisah
aku pakai gitu pun like I fikir about my family
relatives semua dah tahu aku dulu pakai tudung semua
mm itu sebab apa because that one time I suddenly change ah I just suddenly like that tak pakai tudung
nenek aku makcik aku ah like because kita dah rapat gila that's why I don't mind what they say ah
then she she very abeh dia baru lagi
I I I just jawab ah tak ah dekat jer nak buat apa
lepas tu dia kata huh gitu eh
ah gitu lah buat apa
so just kalau kau tak pakai takpe lah
this is the first time I post about yang I tak pakai tudung just ambil gambar biasa jer kan
not tegur as in bad tegur ah dia orang macam cakap eh lawanya
I'm not trying to brag ah but they said eh lawanya kau pakai gini
then I was like oh okay thank you gitu
just so I don't try to bring it up lah gitu
lag ke
pasal dah ya lah
tak lah
aku pergi mongolia royalty tu
even the girls that I know that pakai tudung kan right
they they buka somewhat they same time as me I mean after me
I have no idea but they they buka also leh like they suddenly just tak pakai
cause dah biasa kan dah daripada dulu kecil then after that
kecil as in I started seriously wearing sec one
then the lepas tu holiday pasal aku ada internship kan aku tak pakai
then from then aku tak pakai
sebab tu aku macam like a bit hesitant to wear lah
it's very stupid if they ban that lah macam bodoh sangat lah
that's that's the bad thing you know because it's your adik right then you are the kakak you're supposed to show example then they they have the mindset that
ya you're supposed to learn from your kakak that's all
I mean doesn't suit as in macam kau tak ready gitu
lepas kahwin then okay lah maybe
like because we ignored it right macam kau try to avoid it that's why dia dah malas nak cakap
kalau aurat tu boleh tunggu I know it's a good thing to
obviously you ngaji kena pakai pe
tak lah tak lah tak lah kau jangan
kau macam really lapar sia
macam kering sia tekak aku
boleh juga ah
funan ada apa siol
lebih baik kau boleh buat sendiri siol
kan kau tunjuk aku gambar tu hari
ya oh wah lawa seh
perm balik
I texted you I say because I saw your your hair macam ada bangs then I I was like
aku rebond ni jer
kalau if you dye your rambut nak colour apa
oo yang it hides under jer
itu cool gila seh
their service is okay ah both for both ah karva dengan pearlista
a bit more macam
ya it's kind of affordable lah especially for students right kalau kau pergi pun
ya I mean for the day itself kalau kau nak book obviously full lah dia orang tak ambil lah
macam that time I do my nails for graduation
then I was like pasal aku tak boleh sampai kan kaki aku then plus kaki aku kecil after that they were like
eh I can charge you for children's price then aku macam ah children's price
because it was a voucher yang kita beli dekat you know celeb fest kan kadang-kadang ada kan
ya and then after that makcik aku beli so it's hundred dollars altogether
it's hundred dollars altogether so fifty for me fifty for her then fifty tu aku pakai untuk perming ah so buat pedicure
ada sikit leftover then they refund sikit
so aku macam okay lor
tak pernah eh I just don't want to do anymore it looks very unclean that's why
later a long time later nanti dia karat ya that's why I don't like
rambut jer buat rambut jer
your nails don't bother
or if you like this pendek right beach wave
eh no bukan beach wave
dia tak banyak volume it's like just a bit gitu
then it's lawa
I think today there's really not much to talk about lah because macam
there was a lecture online today tu jer ah
talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
but dia datang lambat
really really kau asyik datang sekolah lambat seh
no but the previous semester usually kau on time for school
speaking of attendance kau tahu aku that time dapat email dari sekolah cakap
just masalah ni like macam
okay K this is err out of topic but like you know leh ni tak tahu siapa asyik reply aku punya tak eh reply aku punya pula always like replying to my instagram stories
yes yes you know this person and dia ah sama course dengan kita masa I think sekarang pun sama lah
mm boleh can
ya Q asyik reply to my eh why do I keep saying reply to my apa tu lah reply to my ah instagram story
but it when he reply right it's always the randomness things macam for example if
and then he will wah tempat ni kat mana seh
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
ini playground aku
apasal dengan budak ni ah maybe
ya and then but tapi recently kan
so dia macam tanya eh this week intern apa eh this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
oh and then err I will reply ah this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern
then I will reply the same thing we twenty one but then I don't want to tanya lah you don't have any classmate meh macam offensive seh
tak tak tak uh this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after
but but dia but he got message you on instagram what that time kau tunjuk aku
no lah I'm I'm not overthinking about it and I I don't like to fikir banyak sangat about this pasal anyways if
if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive kan
dia tahu pe aku ada mata air so why would he even try
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly I am the most boring person in the world and I aku tak suka social interaction
kalau if
stop it and then and then ah he asked me that this is like tengah malam so like twelve midnight
but then I was so lazy so malas to like look up the thing cause I was already in bed macam nak tidur
I told him that and then he is like oh okay tak apa dah jumpa
and I okay you just wasted my time and then he started to move on pasal
uh apa tu about what's my and everything then and
he actually pandai seh his is three point two you know
and then ah I see wah your cumulative is so good then he ask me your intern kau dapat A ah then I say
ya I get A what about you and then dia cakap dia dapat B can't believe he dapat B actually kan that time I berbual with captain ho dia cakap most of the boys dapat B meanwhile the girls get A
aiya whatever lah it's over already anyways your tinggi pe so like there's nothing to
risaukan ya
then he said alah university kalau university pun uh he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it ee
K K kau suka dia
tapi but we are the same height what
ah ya ya can you please tell me what happened I want to know nak tahu
notice apa why ah why leh
huh siapa yang reject kau sia I mean you're like damn pretty
aku feel so betrayed
jauh pe orchard is so far
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau dah nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
I think I think you kau ada cakap telegram oh
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
actually ah I have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together lah so sejak kecil until besar
tapi kan the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
eh no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like secucuk for you lah
adik-adik ya stop it sia
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu ah yang I can recommend to you
no I I told you what he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like I kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so mm
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
ya I faham I faham
but that kind of person susah nak cari seh because like nowadays guys are just
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
actually uh after the truth or dare game right I thought dia
tak suka aku because like I feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
then I am like wasn't the tak oh is he not at me
ya lah tu
huh I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia seh ya
yes yes there was the story then ah you know then after that I teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch lah and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh I think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then ah kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then eh his ex nampak lah then
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up lah
ah aku just tak suka when like uh apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan I mean just make it clear lah that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air sia
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because I don't even know who he is so
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
like kau orang are just platonic friends lah
the mata air dia just have issues lah I think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan yasmin
I don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look ah the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah lah
speaking of the office you know my sister ah I told my kakak about uh all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then uh dia akan uh bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should err the office two point O
aku is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
ah after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person lah and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku seh this one you pass back to err si logistics dulu then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau pe
mm it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
um I I get what you mean though because macam oh at
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID kita kena work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and then oh and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
mm I mean ah almost hari-hari kan my boss will tanya everyone oh what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
um kim yam road nak pergi sengkang okay lah and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit oh my goodness
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so huh
wah so jangan lah
is it jannah dari mata air
kau tak eh
who who who do you have in mind to be jannah mata air
honestly I cannot wait until jannah kahwin though because like
I will feel so happy for her macam yes
any guy yang dapat jannah is a very very lucky guy
no because you kau tahu pe I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like I don't think jannah will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have ah girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew jannah tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
kan saya ni like shaza really shaza pula jap I mean you deserve the best also but jannah also like deserves the best
it's so merepek
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
orang dekat dia orang like oh have you registered to vote
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
especially kat singapore
woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers
it like it's macam
are you guys have to be woke in order to like macam so you guys don't ah offend siapa-siapa I'm like ugh stop it stop it
macam no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
uh actually women dia orang minta for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time ah seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence ah this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind
nak you pergi terancung
actually for my malay aku dapat A two no but there was only after I retake the malay paper
at first the aku dapat B three
mari lah
belajar otak you still got into so it
tak made a difference many ways was like the two best years of my studying life
and aku don't regret at all
and like it's just so lepak
ya I just miss so much and the lecturers actually do give a damn about you and your welfare not just kau punya studies
um ini apa
most of us tak suka miss judy because she was like so naggy for some reason she was so naggy
I remember ah the time yang bila kita baru dapat result for which company kita dapat for intern and then I didn't get lots but and I was so sad
so miss judy got me out of the lecture theatre and dia just she just tanya me ah apa jadi lah then why why asal I'm crying
I said I didn't get the companies that I wanted to and then she just no it's okay takpe I mean she been didn't say takpe but like it's okay
cederakan diri lah
ketabahan is like her macam patience
add to a certain extent lah that cause kau kan perempuan
you macam shiok seh tiba-tiba
it's I yang bilang
kau takde tissue that time
but but that blood was because you were you were scolding this lelaki yang tengah buang sampah sembarangan kan
she betul-betul seh
just route lain
how come I tak tahu it was a fake story
why your cats like so kasar like that if you train them
oh my god mister alan is just so comel you know
mister mister alan ada snapchat
best gila just shiok you know
eh aku tak sabar to get of the country like it's been so long already since we've been like at home and like just in singapore I'm so I'm really getting bored nowadays
ya then after that they say I don't know I actually didn't read the news so much ah but then nampak macam dorang nak buka like give us masuk like kasi kita masuk tapi macam they just I don't know what I don't know what was what happened ah because I don't really read the berita right but I was like
I mean because no no no dorang dah tutup
for like apa berapa bulan dah so like ya I mean I think ever since like the COVID really boom so much right I think they actually um close it already so like
eh betul ke
sekarang are you sure
jap for real ah
okay I guess I guess that's why I don't know because I mean aku baru kerja masa tu kan always night shift mana ada nak siapa sempat tak lah syafiq kyle not my aku dah aku dah dah sebab tak ada kan because of this COVID dah tak ada drama kan so macam dah
apa what the heck
jap so jap but did you know which one is it because I just know there's like zul ariffin
zul ariffin eh um I think I think he there was ah because you know because of COVID kan dorang tak ada buat drama baru kan like now they are in
sedih pe
okay ah but I never cause because of because of okay not really because of COVID but like a few since like a few years ago kan then I already like because of apa friends punya apa-apa nama dia I I guess influence macam gitu they be like K drama K drama K drama ya that's so
aku eh no I feel like
I mean you got to watch the drama first then after that you will be in love dengan character dia pe
lah cerita lama tak best I mean I don't really watch all cerita lama but I watch lah like at um a few years ago punya kan
I watch like macam
I swear every time he macam oh I don't know what to watch goblin and I'm like bro are you
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right I will never re-watch uh not that I'll never re-watch sebab I wouldn't go until six times three four times
but ya lah because you know after I mean I can lah because you know after watching a show right you can actually macam like you know I don't know about you ah but for me after watching a show or like when I watch this show I feel very attached to the show
boring pe aku tak boleh dok macam tu
wah okay that's is that's a new thing for me like macam a new information of someone
actually now that I think about it aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like macam all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america eh not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last one endgame so I only like I only like apa saw that big big one are the main main shows lah I don't really watch the specific um only
ya like you know got the batman lah all that different different one right so I don't really watch yang macam tu
wah but eh but you know because of COVID also right aku this year aku binge watch banyak gila korean drama
okay jap aku okay first aku tengok doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic kan so it's like macam um is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously ada that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then um I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think kirakan about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay ah ya to me ah so I watched the doctor romantic first lah yang first tu so it was that that show is about apa banyak doctor doctor punya scene ah so it's like banyak so jadi punya tempat punya scene wah you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like eh can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery punya punya apa nama dia what do you call it uh surgery punya
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama punya they are so tip top bro
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors pakai oh my god cantik
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same tau like as in like but it's just that why can't it why macam just macam tak sama tau aku aku pun macam
ya so I was like shit okay so dia cakap ada hotel bloom I'm like sabar am I am I suppose to wait for it macam happen like
so dia macam tak ada tak ada
ada lah yang kan aku ada buat aku tengok doctor romantic two dia ada dua dua
I mean maybe not so because kadang-kadang orang nak kan people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama eh dia banyak international fans tau
banyak gila international fans
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
ya ya you know cerita um my is gangnam beauty
eh park seo joon eh bro my is gangnam beauty yang
ya but it's that apa cerita pun dekat suria then I was like sabar
itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka but I think I remember dulu bila back then also selalu tengok because selalu bila kecil-kecil kan mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada box kan you know the android box that kind of thing
dulu mana ada benda tu semua kan like macam
ya so there's always a singapore nya channel so dah tengok singapore nya channel tu kan kadang-kadang like main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya button tu semua kan so kita tengok ah like some of it macam all the apa nama dia channel one is it yang all that dub basically that thing lah
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember ah when I first like came upon on that that apa channel lah aku macam apa benda sia ni
I think ya oh my god okay even aku rasa even kalau dorang kalau park seo joon cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka
but ya I cannot lah watch that kind of show I just need the original punya
ya but honestly for me also kan kalau tengok um subtitle dengan drama at the same time macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga ah sebab you know you wanna
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm uh is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because kadang-kadang
aku dengar jer kan
kan sama sama
but then but then you know sometimes kalau macam I mean not not um not korean drama also like like anything ah because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like macam make faces so is like macam if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then macam you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I tak faham
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
yo same ah same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix aku tengok malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like whoa what are saying translation ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham seh
tapi like kalau kalau apa malay drama pun kadang-kadang dorang guna all the peribahasa ke or like the
like kalau okay singapore nya tak sangat ah singapore nya
oh my god I love anak metropolitan
youths okay ya so oh my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so gerek
ya but if I'm not wrong anak metropolitan actually ada dua dua season kan dua ke tiga season but the one yang dorang tunjuk kat youtube sebab if I'm not wrong sekarang youtube ada then me watch pun ada tapi aku tak tengok ah dulu kan toggle kan I think toggle pun ada ah but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly ah cause like kirakan dorang punya platform I don't think is that is that apa nama dia friendly is it
then kadang-kadang dorang load lama tau like as in like you know macam kalau nak masuk go inside the app then it will like load quite long to actually show you the page show you the ya
ah ya memang memang macam tu because that time aku kat malaysia then aku nak tengok viu tau then aku tak boleh tengok sebab I'm not in singapore
I guess I guess so that's why macam aku tak boleh tengok so I was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so I'm like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa mana-mana sangat kan so I was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam I thought holiday holiday pun I still got time to watch apa drama kan
ya so macam sedih ah
I guess it's not really holiday it's not really holiday a holiday ah sebab aku kan kat rumah kan macam eh sorry not kat rumah aku kan kat rumah cousin aku aku ada cousin yang tinggal kat malaysia so I go there ah everytime kalau nak gi malaysia selalu singgah sana so that's why ingatkan dah kat sana dah ada wi-fi semua then I'm like shit
ya bro ya I mean see because of COVID mana kita boleh pergi malaysia dok what the heck
ada ah tapi macam just macam isi minyak pastu like beli makan sekejap pastu balik you know that kind of thing so it's not like you go there and like staycation eh eh sorry
huh oh aku tak pernah dok pakai train uh pergi
kau bedek ah five minutes
siak okay from here to aku faham ah tapi it's from woodlands kan
abeh kau apa kat dalam kereta kau just tengok
kau punya phone
eh then they should start making at dok
ya ya ya memang memang eh kapal terbang kot kau bro aeroplane how slow can the aeroplane go
aku actually pergi tu aku um in my whole entire life aku jarang pergi just for leisure
I get no no no because um kirakan selalu aku kan cousin aku tinggal kat seremban kan so aku selalu gi seremban no seremban is like you know um johor then I think melaka then after that seremban
ya you know okay I tell you the furthest from here that means the furthest um country in malaysia is perlis is perlis so right apa um uh is perlis so perlis is near thailand so it's like aku selalu pergi sana sebab aku ada cousin kat sana juga ah not cousin ah but more of like makcik pakcik yang tinggal kat sana cause uh arwah atuk aku dia punya family semua dekat perlis then after that I go there ah sometimes right so um I got this place ah got the padang besar padang besar is like the big ass shopping area kat kat perlis so when you go there right you literally see the border of thailand
ya ya ya ya ya you can literally you can literally see the gate entry of thailand kat apa padang besar tu tau then aku macam sebab that time aku bila aku pergi ah first time aku pergi padang besar tu kan then aku tengok ah aku macam because I was thinking the I think car lah cause kat sana tak boleh it's too packed to take the uh uh apa bus so um I took the car ah abeh lepas tu aku nampak ah
naik sebab aku pergi dengan my cousins and my pakcik makcik ah so it's like banyak orang kan so kita naik bus jadi dah naik bus tu um dari sana dari from singapore kita naik bus till like till like perlis or till like half way through then kita change another bus to um perlis so from perlis kita dah ada kita punya all the makcik pakcik kan so kita just pinjam kereta ah kita kita gi jalan-jalan kat itu so dah pergi padang besar tu aku first nampak aku macam why is this why is there macam apa like thailand punya wordings eh kat sini eh macam what
ya so I was like so so I tanya ah
is that close bro that's why from singapore actually right we can go straight I don't know whether we can go whether we can actually go by car until england kalau tak salah
ya ya ya so so so that means from thailand then after that kalau kau pergi atas lagi then you will be connected to another country lepas tu kau boleh pergi to another country then kau boleh ya ya ya so until england kalau tak salah yang paling yang paling
yang paling jauh ah yang kau boleh pergi ah
ah motor okay ah sebab motor dua-dua orang jer kan so like
right oh my god so it's like you can actually just kirakan ah what is it called uh
you know I wanted to do backpacking cause like macam why not right
but then it's budget ah you cause dah bikin
but backpacking selalu
itu backpacking nama dia
it's I thought backpacking selalunya ah maybe I don't know what's the meaning
I guess no because I thought backpacking is like apa memang bawa minimal barang abeh lepas itu
gi oh my god walking eh
wow just gila aku tak tahu siapa yang sanggup jalan kaki from here to
tu macam apa tau tu macam dah apa uh berapa ribu tahun lepas
weh oh my god jauh though
ya dok even from here to jurong east aku tak boleh dok
I mean tak boleh lah cuma macam the thing the the
bukan tak kind of macam malas gila ah nak jalan ah
that's why so I'm like what the because you know kan aku dulu sekolah dekat jurong east kan so macam like macam I kadang-kadang kan kalau terlupa bus pass ke apa then macam nak kena balik sekolah
itu pasal lah kau ingat eh apa aku dah penat-penat apa pergi sekolah apa aku dah penat-penat sekolah then aku nak kena jalan balik rumah oh my god that will be like so tiring sia dengan bag sebab dulu bila kecil-kecil selalu um bawa bag berat-berat kan so macam I don't why though huh
no wonder I was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
aku ingatkan kau actually apa nama dia kau walk just within the
ya ya and like within within jurong lake garden jer tu pasal aku macam okay lah apa-apa yang
jap siapa punya idea ni
science garden science centre ada park kat belakang
actually kau jalan macam jauh jer
but then bila kau jalan kat reservoir macam jauh tau
asal kau pergi jauh-jauh eh sebab dari sini sebab kalau naik bas ah kau dari sini kau boleh apa I mean that is a bit
then why you have to go science centre bagai
for real ah sebab actually from here kalau kau naik bas ah kau boleh naik I think naik bas tiga puluh kat sini abeh kau stop somewhere near taman jurong abeh lepas tu nanti
ya lah ya lah I mean that's why I was like wondering asal sampai science centre sebab from here but
so it's like ya taman jurong so I'm like dari situ then boleh jalan pe that's why I was like science centre asal seh
ye lah semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau confident sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau eh kau cakap kau dah sampai
ya I mean kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun eh kita semua dah berapa tahun obviously we have to be like independent
wah you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like macam okay so dah nak dekat kiamat kan so like why not I apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap kan kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat madinah ke makkah ke kau tak kan jumpa dengan dajjal kan so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when uh one thing yang aku tak tahu is that dorang cakap that apa nama dia even even orang yang duduk kat makkah dengan madinah um
no no no you dajjal can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the apa malaikat ah so like macam but then the thing is within makkah and madinah there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami tau
in in the end of times ah so there will be so uh because of that tsunami or earthquake it will keluarkan orang-orang yang
beriman gitu ah
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in itu so yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri they will keluar
dorang akan stay inside so that's why yang so that's why I was like thinking abeh kalau macam tu kalau in the end of times kalau aku pergi sana juga then what's the point though sebab because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore kau mana ada experience tsunami or earthquake pun kan
ya you know you know that time aku pernah pergi japan dengan sekolah aku pergi sana for school trip lah kan so then lepas itu aku
oh itu pun
ah australia dorang apa afini uh apa eh tak bukan atikah ella dengan alia dorang pergi melbourne so aku pergi japan dengan puteri dengan ifa so aku pergi sana then lepas tu um kan you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big apa gitu kan so
ya so kita uh yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi hiroshima dengan aku pergi osaka
yes history all that so dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal history kan so dah alang-alang belajar history kita nak kena belajar lah pasal we went to this macam ambulance place eh not ambulance macam fire place gitu to like learn about macam ways to like save yourself from like apa
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually ah we did a earthquake punya simulation
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah I try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
so aku pergi sana aku macam so there's like different different um
apa ya
ya so it's like uh they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us uh yang medium or towards the high a bit just to rasa rasa kan
it's just the tip of the iceberg ah you think just a bit ah gitu kan
it's not the worst ah it's not the level seven ah it's like level four or five gitu ah dia kasi kita try kan kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar siol it's really it's really like bergegar like macam I can't even like
jap so kalau kita
jap okay so kalau kita tengah earthquake ni kan kita boleh masuk sini tak
tak as in like as in like it's not a good place right sebab benda ni kan
right so like macam
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
tak dorang cakap kan because kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk cover kan
ah kau kau guna anything to cover yourself just to like macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau
ya ya ya so because kau punya head yang paling important pe dia yang dia yang control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya oh my god that one sedih juga though kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi I mean okay tapi kau punya kaki dah
ah and like kalau dah penyek kau confirm nak kena amputate
ah itu itu lama gila
ya so that's why a bit scary ah gitu kan
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic lah but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is apa kirakan it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well lah like sekarang
singapore actually dapat
it's good that kita kecil ah cause kalau kita kalau kita besar confirm tak boleh control ah sebab
hmm lagi nasib baik kat singapore ada banyak quite a number of uh hospital kan and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
if I'm not mistaken community hospital yang all the firstly is all the very minor minor punya sickness ah are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing lah
and it's also for people yang from the major hospital transfer to
I mean ng teng fong ada community hospital
ya so that's why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so I guess if I'm not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
so like you can see like all the you know like kalau for houses I don't know if you know ah but for houses kan nanti they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then kalau for hospital they would show hospital punya itu ya so macam from the outside we can
I kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so I was like oh I guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
I mean is sekarang banyak gila foreigner datang sini seh like banyak gila
actually sekarang
wait so bapa kau masih kat sana
alah sedihnya sorang-sorang
oil abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa
ah tapi kalau oil but he's not really in contact with oil lah right he's just like
I mean baju dia kau dah cuci actually that time kan bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja airline kan so dia pun nak kena fix fix all the aeroplane punya stuff right
ah ya it's time kerja cause dia cakap dia balik rumah then dia nak kena tukar baju because apa dia terjatuh oil ya then I was like I was like shit apa bau sia ni
it so strong macam toxic
ya but then actually kalau kau pergi I don't for you but for me aku kalau pergi what is it called petrol station aku suka bau dia
low-key tapi aku macam
ya so but then that time apa dia kena kat dia punya baju kan so baju obviously aku rasa dah in contact with the skin gitu ah
ya so it's like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh

abang kosh
the sister is dee kosh punya sister
what are influencers influencers buat apa
so am I right to say right am I right to say eh ted bundy pun influencer
ted bundy pun influencer
tapi lifestyle dia orang tapi lifestyle dia orang gerek pe
like more than a hundred thousand subs lah not not that I do or I care lah but macam sekarang
talking to them talking to them very talking about them very poorly lah macam
kau ambil kesempatan kan untuk bual
untuk bual dengan mengumpat orang mengumpat pasal orang then
kau mengumpat mengumpat mengumpat then
you know that you you didn't prepare contingency plan lah furthermore also macam everybody
tapi kau kau pandai kau pandai sangat kan
this kind of content eh the macam
gossipping eh to me right is macam is very normal you know guys gossip
we're keeping it to ourselves whereas macam dee kosh eh he
macam I I actually I I more or less kind of hate most of the
now sekarang
err macam like still remember err the what's her what the fuck's her what the fuck's her name err
ah nicole choo with the ridhwan azman kan macam
actually if you when I think about it again eh when I when I really really think about it again ah macam actually the nicole choo right is not doing anything wrong you know
nicole nicole choo right nicole choo dengan ridhwan eh memang they memang dia orang buat
habis macam they have the drama and then people are not supposed to know about this drama you know but they
then dia orang punya pasal lah then dia orang punya pasal lah then you want to comment right fine lah you can comment you can fine lah you can go ahead
at times right macam I feel that it's err
err from what I know lah macam he made a video like reviewing her reviewing her work
so macam then
look at how macam she got reviewed and all that I mean okay I
to me right to me eh the only wrong right they only wrong eh yang the you only wrong that
if in my very humble opinion lah the only wrong yang dia buat kan is
like my also eh also apasal budak-budak zaman sekarang kan you guys are so drawn right to simple stupid shit
okay is because you all budak-budak zaman sekarang right love nonsense eh like TikTok and
okay if that was the case right can you tell me ah agak-agak kan
what kind of orang kan is selalu buat benda macam ni
what type of what type of what type of orang
like the fact you right the fact is macam
male err like these YouTube celebrities right that's why or like ridhwan right because macam I don't see any of the things that they do right macam
applicable to my life useful in useful useful in my life right or macam I don't see them possessing any characteristics right which I as a man right can look up to and respect ah
although the err macam at fate
manlier than I'm manlier than they are then macam like
what skills that do that they possess what skills do they possess right macam
that's really macam
macam that's really important
but they are not really that funny and then look at their target demographic ah their their target demographic right is macam
is err those macam budak err those macam budak-budak belum sunat gitu
then err macam they budak-budak belum sunat then
so macam I don't think so in a sense right
in a sense eh macam

dia tak nak dia tak nak buka mulut dia so lepas dia abeh lepas tu bila part doctor nak letak macam ubat err sebal kan dia tak kasi dia tutup jer mulut dia all the way sampai bapa dia marah dia
then lepas itu dia macam then he cried like literally he cried he's already nervous after that her his went down to went up to around hundred hundred over plus hundred forty
tapi bapa dia bapa dia macam marah marah dia but then we kita cakap dengan bapa dia lah actually kalau the like normal person sendiri takut so he have to macam he have to understand lah okay encourage dia yang dia uh this is gonna be a you know macam it's gonna be a it's like something new for him also you know

the nenek also was there the nenek lives there or something like that
mm plus eh tak payah tak payah tak tak
it's like apa tu what they say is it investment
like the higher rank one they they do that macam they they buy a condo because their pay is already high what so they they buy a condo
apa ni ya
I think they see also lah macam what kind of like background
family members support also you know macam like they like oh okay lah I got this amount like I
boleh tak start balik
okay I have a friend in in lah so macam they are they are brought up in a very err
ya so like macam
so like macam most of them um
they want to like go to like macam apa ni
so like macam wah like very interesting like they have they know that it's already like fixed you know
so I like wah so so lucky then like they like very chim know then like macam
susah sangat eh
ya if if they want if I mean like if they want to macam
work in a line where requires like or masters then okay lah but then I feel like macam
the type of work or like macam what you want to do
so it's like more of like macam
he was like uh telling me afiq actually kan um degree tak tak perlu sangat lah macam like if you want you want lah I mean like
huh my my senior ah my senior dia cakap actually at first also I want to take degree then bila fikir balik macam
um waste uh not not not say waste of time lah macam like you you need more money what to pay you school bills and all
apa tu enhance or like
like he can just like get in already because of the experience that he get macam like his
ya so first half is um local then macam I think around four months lah four months is overseas
so I got a double cert macam
like uh apa apa apa apa lah
in half a year and usually like that kind of thing take like macam a few years or like macam in one year ah
tunda lah kahwin ho then dapat anak dah empat puluh
chey sedih seh tu tak lah
no lah it won't this one ya tiga puluh
eh lelaki dengan perempuan masalah tau
ya eh really I mean like macam okay for for the girls eh
I mean like of course like we as guys like we want anak or what
then imagine kalau like you know that you can't um produce anak
then like it's another thing then you feel like macam
family tree ya ya zuriat wow
I wanted to say zakat zakat different thing sia
imagine if like your jodoh is like a older like for me eh a guy my jodoh is a older girl
or females is more like macam I feel that uh like girls kan macam like now the this like our generation kan
but I feel that now like macam they want to
unless ya unless your pay is like macam ada commission that kind
macam not
so that's why you need to have a back up ah macam like
satu ribu tu like for the longest time
ah then your the one that you saved up confirm [dah] makin lesser what
like a heads up eh macam now people start to think oh I need a like a back up plan I need savings that kind of thing
unless your company have like macam monthly pay cause uh ya cause like
um one of my friend uh apa ni
err dia kerja events so like monthly she got like a fixed pay of like two point five
uh apa ni she
um jobs ah macam like ada commissions so macam they give a lot of like commission things tau so she need to do a lot of like
so macam she will take in the other
uh person punya slot
so like okay let's say like macam you you already have a thing to do
then after that but still the commission will like the double commission tu will like
ya so so like macam it will add up lah it will add up to one commission in the end but then that commission can like
macam whatever they sell they will get like a few percent of it
gila kan
ya lah she untung lah
two no not cawangan err
so that this group will do some of this group punya work then this group will do like ya
crazy lah so macam like
ya but then of course the the shit that they go through like banyak masalah lah ya
ah sembarang ambil
uh got lah got but then um macam if you need to work
you really need to macam you need to put your work first like that
instead of like family of what which is the point like my friend macam
at a point of time she give up she wanted to like macam just um quit
so like macam
ya but you really need to stand for your right lah even though macam that pay is good ke apa kan but you must know your
so that the their apa ni the one that will take over them
ah dia orang punya anak will not have
so that macam like in like some people have like emergency money what
oh at that time uh they have a saving so they were sharing with me lah and my family macam they have a saving
uh okay their emergency is like so weird it's like macam okay emergency like wedding
like dia punya anak wedding
exactly macam okay like let's say macam
err last minute um the the anak couldn't pay for certain things kan
err then macam they need to help out in a way like that kind of like emergency lah
ah macam like those those small things macam like maybe uh venue
ah macam like
not it bukan bukan lupa bukan lupa but then she couldn't pay
because she's okay her ikat tunang
ah ah that one I don't know ah okay dia punya ikat tunang is two years
so I think she like macam want to get uh married lah already lah macam more earlier so they push like one year plus
then the mum was like think like saying are you sure I feel do you have like enough saving already then she say err nevermind lah buat simple simple
so like everything was like tergantung then the mum keep asking have you paid have you paid have you do this have you do that then she said oh ya ya ah later lah later lah then
but her side is already then she like macam
take it very lightly so I was like thinking kau nak kahwin ke tak nak kahwin ni kau serious ke tak serious ni
then I mean like if you want simple then just like nikah then makan sikit-sikit ah this one she do like a sanding sanding
then like got this and that I mean like macam okay the the quality is not as like
you know this girl ah she everything she tangguh tangguh tangguh then after that
cannot take it already the mum like there's no updates or anything then the mak ask her
then she like err ya actually ni nak kena bayar lagi berapa ribu gini then the mum like
then the mum the mak don't want to say like she got money to help
then her mum actually um help out lah in a way like macam a few percent of the
ya only like maybe like nikah lah
I think it's a that's what like every parents want nak ah ya because like even my mum also like
uh don't want lah we make uh some some somewhere that is like macam bigger ke apa lah
then like if more bigger means more money then she said err tak apa lah err I mean like
I can help you to help you like settle this or that then like of course my brother is like the first child so he don't want to like macam burden my mum
so but then my mum wants it so like macam
dia dilemma lah whether to do or not when she said then then the girlfriend um ya the girlfriend also like
said thinking like macam
uh tak apa lah kita buat simple simple you know gini gini but then like my mum want it to be like
um sempurna lah in a way looks good like people side
ya so like macam but the family is quite small
so okay so like macam not a lot from her side then from my brother side my brother really thought was like okay I will invite like less err he will be inviting like less than a thousand of people
macam maybe six hundred or five hundred depending on ya dah how many
know like macam
ya ya see kalau ada kemampuan lah I mean like ah ya then that ya then that's the that's one of the emergency money
and then like after that like macam maybe house or what
like macam
uh so that's why like macam
and plus like macam it depend how you
investment eh apa tu namanya um
like macam like you will get money if you
like insurance like that tapi you will get monthly money ah
no macam every month you pay something then after that you will receive um
ya tak
that's why I mean like definitely we want to adult with a clean way like macam a clean way of saving money or like getting investment kan
masing-masing ah eh masing-masing
kalau tak okay ah
dia dia curi daripada bapa dia then she give me I don't know then um err got caught lah got caught by the teacher teacher teacher cause we went to the next block only like this is the primary school the next block she saw because the staircase is like
bocor gila then um apa ah dah kena tangkap then her family lah her family kena called what kena called they came down ah they came down where you get the cigarette ah apa adik curi daripada bapanya I was like

at first they say okay err they give me a choice lah I don't know why ah they give me a choice but to my friend they never gave a chance they straight away call I think because is not her first time ah because that one is really my first time then err terus my my cikgu datang ah she she was like she's a very nice principle lah she eh no that one is principal not teacher she came to me like okay I'm going to give you a choice is either you go home tell your parents about what you did today
err dulu I like to mix around with like eighteen year olds because dulu kan eighteen year old boleh beli kan last time I mix around with eighteen year olds people then they smoke then I was like eh I was like eh I want then my senior was like
not really stole lah he just left it out then he was drunk then I was like oh you know what if I take he's not going to know ya then err then my senior was like okay kalau kau hisap rokok kau ambil ah so sorry then um I came down lah we came down lah they give me then we smoke I was like wah hisap rokok tapi tak tarik tau then I was like err because this one is called tarik
if tak tarik is like you receive the smoke is more thicker
ya so that point of time I was like just like that lah I never like like that so they was like err and they were like um okay then they teach me lah how to tarik then I was like eh feels much better but I cough a lot lah
man apa ah err ya lah then they taught me how to smoke then we start to smoke smoke until I get to buy my own pack I tried my best twenty next year baru twenty one ya but now I still lepas lah but then ya
tak sometimes is your ya I think because of my body size that's why dia orang macam okay okay can can because I have the body of mak-mak punya orang macam last time last time but now I am like I I went back to skinny then I went back to like this now
and my thighs thighs memang susah nak hilangkan ah
takpe takpe exactly now with my father lah my father cakap eh kau ni gemuk apa lah semua tu that time I blast out at him like this is my body I'm your daughter you don't have to body shame me
no matter what exactly oh my god that is like damn offensive then everyone is like oh my god malunya then err that time I blast out at him lah like this is my body as my father you cannot just body shame me in front of others like
exactly and kau kurus pun is not in a healthy way so kau nak aku kurus apa ikut cara kau then is like oh my god I'm so frustrated then my father was like
like keep quiet ah dia macam serba salah gila then he minta maaf lah it's like bapa minta maaf ah I'm very sorry for what I said to you then sekarang dia start balik cause I want to take err license uh motor punya license so he at first ah dia memang tak kasi dia larang dia larang gila babi then I ask from my mum my mum kasi then I told my dad lah like asal mama boleh kasi bapa tak boleh kasi then he
he was like huh mama kau kasi kau permission cause my mum and dad cerai so bila nak dapat decision memang susah gila ah then err apa ah then my dad said okay fine kalau kau betul-betul nak ambil lesen kau kuruskan badan kau dulu then I was like you know what okay asalkan dia kasi me that macam only way
macam okay kau nak aku kurus fine I do anyways lah like any way that I can do like tak makan ke apa anything but last time I never eat for almost two months I was damn thin that's why I say when last time I err I was not fat
biscuits that's all ya light snacks only ya lah if that's the only way he can let me take license right you know what I'm just gonna do it not just not to eat lah I mean like just be skinny for him to macam okay fine kau dah boleh ambil lesen
why not mm look look at your friends your friends all poly right I'm still like those macam you know so I like motor since young cause I grow up with my aunty what then her anak
is a the first the first child was a guy so I look up to him as I grew up lah and then the motor ya he ya I'm the only child ya then dia ada motor he is very successful lah like alhamdulillah dia successful then dia pun dah kahwin then bini pun
anak pun dah dua macam okay lah you know what I'm just gonna be like him lah he he is a major in err I think major sergeant ah I don't know in in his army ya cause he signed on ya
that one is navy navy lagi susah malay navy lagi susah
oh okay err oh shit about the army oh my god so now I I want to be a I want to join in the army also as a female yeah I want to go to all guys there yang perempuan ni actually boleh buat semua macam gitu
I know how to self-defence like siapa-siapa nak pegang kan try me like seriously I learn a lot how to self-defence with guys lah cause dah banyak kali kita dah take advantage but then I learn how to be stronger lah belajar belajar belajar belajar pang satu kali ni this guy ah dia nak try one time shoot he run away he was like like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one yang nak ambil advantage punya he he tried to macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua then I was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can lah can lah terus I give up like okay kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa I give him one punch at his face because I was
that one I don't care lah like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me ke buang uh me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done lah and dia pangkat sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant punya rank lah so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did buang so whatever he did to me he will get back lah ya
I don't know the way that is not like err being like disrespectful disrespecting lah I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad lah kirakan cause he's the one that create us what so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with allah like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like bukan macam eh lu macam muak no
that's exactly ya that is like ya allah tolong lah jangan lah buat macam gini you know like please lah please lah at least that one he knows macam because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know macam like berbual maki ya allah you know that
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those hijab people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay ah macam you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear hijab and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant blah blah blah no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
same sama ya true true
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect memang betul kita semua bukan perfect pun
so is like something is even orang yang very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam oh wow kita aku rasa aku betul ah tapi orang lain tengok macam eh actually dia ni apa sia dia buat a'ah sia salah sia padahal sendiri fikir macam oh baik baik baik
tapi nanti bila dah live a long life already fikir balik macam like oh my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that lah like so sekarang for the mak and minah I feel sorry for them ah because they maybe tak dia kurang ajar
pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a minah and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a minah
I can be a minah I can be a mat I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and allah give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to macam you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes kita tak macam we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but padahal macam pada kita is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to macam sugarcoat everything macam oh wow you are doing so great eh takpe ah kau pakai hijab tak tutup err apa apa ni leher takpe lah lupa melayu sikit takpe ah kau tak tutup pun takpe eh takpe ah tak pakai tudung ah kau pakai tudung dengan sleeveless pun tak apa eh kau nak main bola pakai tudung
never heard of that but ya like semalam dah cakap ah it's like okay that kind of teguran is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like wow
eh example like macam wah farah so nice ah she everytime sugarcoat me ya but padahal farah itself is like
exactly uh like seriously I feel so malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri
eh oh my god kalau tak jadi riak pun allah tak terima sia so allah sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat so the more you share to people macam eh kau tahu tak aku solat sia eh lima waktu sia
okay then what you want me to do macam oh wow you confirm go to heaven lah what you expect exactly so is like oh my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite quran ah a lot of time macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam eh kau dah khatam belum like aku dah khatam sia
I'm like okay you can at least say like macam okay kalau if your friends like haven't khatam and you have already khatam like at least two times three times you can just ajar that person macam okay lah aku tolong kau lah aku bimbing ah apa aku akan jadi your guide lah
guidance okay so kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam K lah aku jadi cikgu engkau lah aku dah khatam banyak kali like you don't have to say that macam okay lah
like for example I haven't khatam you already khatam then I'm like I really want to khatam because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of um like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then farah came up to me like example lah macam uh do you need help like kau belum khatam kan sebab aku baru khatam so kau perlukan bantuan tak at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay ah boleh tolong tak
macam you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like oh my god like memalukan gila lah serius serius like tuduh ke

azrul selalu keluar I remember
ya dia fresh pass pun eh aku nampak ada P plate kat kereta dia

motor apa seh
is that macam punya
kawan kak yin siapa sia
nadia punya is that one meh
apa racer
oh very dia lah very dengan kind macam gini eh
yes dia pun macam macam rumi juga a bit lah
it's just the pelik for me
I don't know ah dia macam
I think dia dah gonna get
engaged eh ke kahwin tak tahu lah cause dia I don't know aku selalu nampak dia on Instagram dengan this one indo girl
in the video I think I got hear before dia berbual indo macam indo punya kind
so that time dia dengan dorothy together
and then dia punya Instagram is still dia dengan perempuan tu
I don't know eh but dorothy punya Instagram is different dorothy dengan dia
so I don't know ah apa
what kind of three way ke apa binatang it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird pelik also
then that time yang aku pergi tengok thai punya performance kat monti
then kita invite rumi also lah cause rumi cakap dia nak tengok like um drag performance those nya kind
and then banyak-banyak then
tertiba dia macam tak ada girlfriend
dia dia cakap dia single cause
know thai punya friends those gay friends keep asking ah like apa tu oh ah where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what dorang macam nak menggatal kan then macam like
oh no lah I'm single and some more dia tengah in ke apa
but then dia punya Instagram masih ada the indo girl tu
and then just damn pelik ah sia and he host around with anything that moves
aku pun tak tahu aku just don't know lah
but I know zul tak comfortable dengan rumi also
zul pun petty nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap like I don't want to talk to rumi cause he never wish me happy birthday
macam apa kau merepek eh
ya apparently then aku macam
girl kalau aku lupa nak wish kau macam mana eh how ah and was like I probably won't talk to you ah
I tak faham
aku just tak faham I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday dia macam like dia cakap birthday is important what it's once a year what so hard
then aku cakap like if you're not
ah aku tak faham ah
but zul know I know zul um tak comfortable cause of tu ah
um rumi I think rumi macam menggatal dengan dia also
unfortunately for his case lah but I think that time zul was with dylan dengan mata air dia ah
ya and then dia cakap like rumi eh rumi uncomfortable and then macam
kalau I know we are all closed kita very touchy also cause we hug a lot ni semua then
dia cakap rumi rumi does that ah but rumi macam
it's kau
macam gitu jer ah
but rumi I've always seen as that way cause first time aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu
kita semua minum pe together at sticky fingers
but I like to see dia punya Instagram cause dia selalu pergi merayap makan and he eats good food
kat tempat the weirdest place
ya and dia ada motor I think
I think dia ada motor vespa
vespa dia macam ada shield macam that big ass shield kat depan
dia very gitu lah macam indie macam dia nak stand out from the rest
dia macam dia kind of mainstream but dia tak nak show yang dia mainstream so he gets something that is
macam kawan kau ni ah also macam motor tak banyak but actually people want that kind of bike
ya dia macam gitu jer
maybe ah the dorang just what one year apart kan
dorang sama batch pe so ya
cause dorang cousin
ya hor then that one yang mana muka dorang pun tak sama sangat
case dorang pakai baju
senonoh gitu ah quite presentable
but aku just stress ah
aku just stress tengok dorang
I think dorang tu lah
I think rumi ambil
culinary but I don't know if it's ke tak I think he went to SHATEC or some
cooking school cause aku nampak dia selalu masak jer
uh I don't think rumi take aku dulu ingat dia gemuk dia pernah tunjuk gambar dia
dia tunjuk gambar dia grow up ah that that night at sticky fingers ah dia macam like eh you all want to see or not I last time look like what gemuk gila gemuk gila macam bola sia muka dia
I think masih ada kat dia nya Instagram dia post
probably eh cannot be dia baru enlist baru juga enlist
kau tahu yang dia kambing boy kan
kau tahu advertisement yang kambing
no like I think Suria ada this advertisement where
anak kambing saya and then dorang pergi macam this farm abeh ada advertisement kambing lari-lari rumi was
rumi was that boy in the in the kambing video that's why when aku jumpa dia kan at times like eh
kau macam familiar then tahir first time aku dah tahu dulu cause dia cakap dia in that kambing video and then when I brought tahir out to meet justin zul rumi semua and then macam like
and then keep keep keep guessing then thought he really is the kambing boy but dia tak pernah post ah
tak pernah post at all kau tengok gemuk weh
then dulu dia masih gemuk sikit
he doesn't like pout or whatever shit oh dia ambil gambar nanti boleh nampak macam kalau aku nak ambil selfie atau aku ambil group photo nanti tiba-tiba macam like dia adjust adjust dulu angle dia baru dia stare through camera gitu
oh there kawan-kawan dia
I don't know many picture ambil budak whampoa ah sia
if I'm not wrong dia bukan melayu
but dia berbual melayu ah I think
dia ada malay blood but I don't think it's like full
it's smaller and smaller lagi-lagi kalau kau masuk kan tertiba semua orang kau kenal
macam aku ah aku before aku satu orang pun tak kenal sia aku cuma tahu aku punya secondary school friends and friends
then masuk you will be like eh kau kenal ni kau kenal tu oh aku dari dulu sekolah tu
kau masuk aku rasa kau will meet
cause kau ninety nine
so yang kau meet also is those like long route punya sekolah
lagi lama lah sia
poly itself is already three years kalau kau remote remote
no choice I think last boleh ambil kau twenty six twenty seven
twenty aku masuk twenty fourteen twenty fourteen
twenty fourteen atau twenty thirteen ya
then ada satu budak ni from nineteen ninety
so it's like what twenty four gitu and he's one of the oldest
aku rasa kau kau masuk nanti kau tua sia kau masuk next year kan
eh kau graduate is what month
april oh that means kau aku punya intake ah
should be masuk may atau june aku june intake what
girl aku that time tak ada choice
aku two weeks jer aku dapat surat tu aku dah kena masuk kena campak ah sia
aku nya applications for private schools jer dah rejected say oh we cannot accept you cause your letter is too soon and then cannot cannot apa tu reject aku nya school applications cause
it doesn't makes sense but aku aku tak faham but aku masuk anyway
if aku defer I have a feeling I would go into army
for sure cause abang aku not in recruit anymore what
that time I wanted to lah I die want to cause aku nak main combat combat nak main tembak-tembak semua cause
tak ada orang dapat main tembak apa unless you're in police lah but police punya
weapons weaponry and shit is different is more to apa tu defence atau macam whatever protection lah
duit aku sia
is it the one kat tempat yang yang
dekat dengan some centre thingy where all secondary school last time kena pergi kan
itu yang indoor kan
ya but yang outdoor pun ada pe budak-budak pergi
last time is the same venue just that ada macam this tempat lapang ni
padang or some some plain field lah I don't know I not I not
we'll see lah we'll see kalau kau masuk army ke tak okay
petition for apa eh
of course lah dia nak standardise dia nya family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum kat tempat the car wash kat then macam like
oh baba lele is then macam aku and then pop is police then aku macam like okay what kalau adik masuk at least dia belajar real life skills kalau tak masuk paramedic pun at least ada firefighter cause ada dua jer pe yang
hot spot nya vocation then macam like tak nak ah mama nak dia masuk army that's it
sister aku dah macam gitu macam okay but ya lah I mean
for sure kau better off in
army lah cause kau dulu pe
aku rasa mama kau die die tak nak kau masuk police lah or just cause dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya son go through the
ah boys punya experience
ah brotherhood dia dia cakap yang oh tak ada brotherhood
macam what where my sisterhood
ada tu ada lah tapi macam you know nanti korang dah pergi station terus kau pecah like go scattered elsewhere
but ya kau masuk army sua
kau have one job okay kau jangan disappoint your mum
technically budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada choice pe apa benda before enlistment you can apa tu fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause dorang cakap banyak orang depression cakap yang dorang kena campak to different organisation and then dorang suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill punya shit
especially banyak orang complain sia aku tak faham aku that day pergi balik to my academy aku tengok
barang-barang kau semua dah siap sia atas katil
it's not like macam dorang bagi kau an empty bag then like my time I
bag bag besar tu then kena pergi two different store rooms cause aku kecil gila so aku kena cari aku punya size know campak kena ambil dorang dorang campak helmet
helmet dorang campak bottle dorang campak jer eh macam like
macam kau tahu aku tak tahu aku rasa dorang were paid to be that much of a an asshole
so dorang macam kat table dorang kan dorang macam like S size S size then budak-budak store dia macam like keluar kan barang abeh macam like campak campak kat pile lah so that pile is all S size another pile is so
kalau aku nak aku ambil from that pile yang dorang campak campak tu ah so aku just ambil jer
then dah tu apa
aku patah balik bunk kau tahu kita kena
apa tu apa dia cakap fall in eh
fall in kat tempat kita punya coy apa benda tu and then kita alpha so alpha tingkat dua jer tak payah nak naik like five six storeys but alpha alpha and bravo
um kita nya bunk is
single bed is not like double deck so I think charlie and delta delta paling worst ah obese kan so delta is the last floor plus dorang bunk bed ya so the entire macam kau tahu the spiral stairs
it's not an open stairs dia macam ada window ah but tutup so kadang-kadang bila dorang dah habis training dorang nak naik kan nanti dia punya tingkap all like foggy
cause dorang punya body sweat and heat kan naik atas and especially dorang kena sampai tingkat enam ke lima girl aku tengok dorang you know bau lah cause they have cause we have to share the stairs ada tiga so
so pandai pandai korang lah scatter kan but I don't know why dorang suka naik kat tangga where it's always alpha yang kena pakai alpha pakai cause alpha tingkat dua jer and then dorang naik itu
but anyway bila aku nampak aku kan nak tidur kan dorang macam kena brief debrief eh kau punya before kau boleh tidur kau kena drink up drink up aku is like
ya I think the bottle besar lah sia
I don't know how many ah I think one litre atau five hundred cannot be five hundred this is not much this is five hundred
so it's one litre ah tu so one litre kau tahu aku dah gini gini means half kan
so aku manage to drink half then aku tak boleh minum then aku
dorang tak boleh cheat what cause nanti at the end of the tu siapa dah habis kena gitu

kau nak jerit kat orang buat apa eh
ya but why jerit during when can jerit everyday and not be in that also
dorang tu um scout me for
apa tu saint john
tak nak medical kan

cause it's the biggest uh macam parade kan
cause I remember D&T block like really kecil and then in between the classes
no the centre one banyak pokok the the gardening the science block one is slightly bigger the space
situ jer korang merayau kat sana
but ya I I mean is the foot drill kan macam side side foot drill nya competition macam korang buat foot drill cause of footwork so korang buat the or whatever shit it is called is for precision
ee ada what what uniformed group ada eh
I know primary school ada scout
oh join kat luar
buang masa jer
east side tak ada eh
west coast ada cause that time I remember ada this budak book in
kau masih budak how can you
eighteen and I hold like like corporal how are you lieutenant then I realised aku zoom kan it's not civil defence
it's and then they go around macam
I think macam tu ah hannah nya ex siapa tu nama nya
siapa nama dia khai eh
ya and then dia dia nya mum
text hannah cakap like takmo jumpa anak dia selalu
tak cukup ke jumpa kat sekolah kau imagine kalau mak dia dah cakap gitu dekat faiz faiz would
kan terus ten K pun buang
merlin merlin semua camelot semua ada
wait but the one yang faiz bilang kan is the same night yang kita keluar
um cause when faiz bilang kan
oh wait my mum did say something about like faiz got something to tell the family I macam apa benda
how his mum gonna fork out ten K I mean you have to understand faiz is an only child habis tu dia nya parents also
work humbly lah like kerja enough for dia punya own small family he's not a richie boy a richie solo kid
and all his earnings are to his family and his his own allowances dia tak minta pun ibu dia duit that's for sure I know lah
so kalau dia minta a'ah minta aku two hundred
aku dah order apa dia cakap dia dah order tak ada duit nak bayar then aku macam
aku tak faham sia dia eh buat aku stress sia
lapar lah sia
kau imagine kalau aku abang aku dengan faiz are all girls mak aku minta ah confirm dorang tak nak kan bayar kan bodoh
oh ya yang tempat park avenue tu
not the melayu
I malay melayu
ah sia aku bagi dia eight eight jer lah
abang kau bagi fatin how much
but quite sepet mata dia weird eh was it dengan kau
ah dengan kau lah
kan aku keluar lift then aku cakap eh ni nak salam ke tak eh
then mak aku cakap itu kan bapa pengantin that's the one kan
oh ya ya he got the sepet eyes
damn kau ada kau ada new member
tiger dah accept
bodoh lah
apa sia tak ada duit nyayi
aku tak save pe duit
no I mean like there's a difference what between kau nya savings for your own self savings for
mm but he's holding the entire family punya
every month atau year annually got money lah store in so can take out once cause dia nak let go let go of all so that we all have our individual punya insurances investments and shit so he keep forcing me to be more independent so aku macam like apa ni I am still seventeen at heart but cannot lah
ya ya I think dia bilang
but we met what that time yang kat airport all all her sisters were there except for the youngest one
ya the yang kecil tak ada cause that time me and tahir didn't know that the youngest sister existed ya and then when dia tunjuk adik dia aku macam siapa ni this one my sister huh your older sister no this one my younger huh tahir pun macam like no cause we thought
all youngest cause tahir youngest aku youngest kau youngest so we thought she also youngest she don't give off the slightly older sister vibe
cause the mum tanya apa like ah this one can trust or not go overseas this one how old already twenty nine twenty three we are turning twenty two
cause we are what nineteen birthday kau dah lepas pe
ah kau nineteen lah twenty eighteen what
tahir nya birthday belum lagi apa so
september ya and then kita balik a few days later birthday dia
eleven cause that time you I got apa tu notified it's on my archive
it's too much already eh now banyak sia kawan aku dah post macam like
um much needed eh apa tu much misses holiday either bali lah patong beach lah all those
aku was there like
so mama you already you know right that kakak kan suka makan ayam goreng right and then lately kakak macam makan popeyes sebab I think popeyes punya ayam goreng is way nicer than what do you think
popeyes punya ayam is more crunchy eh I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye punya like lebih sedap
and then compared to punya tak sedap langsung I mean like it's it's it's nice
lagi-lagi like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
but then you still have to wear your mask macam susah and then it's also tak fun langsung sebab
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people macam complain
dia susah to dapat the vouchers sebab ada berapa banyak website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website tu then in the process semua pun macam very sulit and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think kalau tak salah first of december
I don't know eh I think so like I saw at kita punya void deck they put the poster everything then they say um start date thirtieth this monday lah thirtieth november until like
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean kemas and then the after is yellow very dirty then macam macam asyik lunyai and everything so ya
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask tak boleh dipakai so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that dia punya paint very faint very thin macam acrylic dia it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with err like a bit more macam like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last mah so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very rugi because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag banyak all my stuff so ya I don't know see how lor even if I buy like um the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so tak tahu ah macam mana
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then kalau tak habis then I will be rushing then susah if I rush because
I think so ah that one also not so sure you have to check with the ustazah again
ya the water sports sounds fun ah but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so tak tahu macam mana
until june two thousand and twenty is kalau tak salah the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
um chop chop type of person ya you know so kena we all nak buat macam cepat-cepat because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then dapat rehat cepat so ya
I think you can ask adi if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got madrasah tomorrow
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog goreng or like fishball like that
the epok-epok also just now err orang sebelah kasih also like very nice also
but the epok-epok like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very garing
I think like the epok-epok when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old chang kee one cause it's like
err taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat sebab dia banyak inti and then dia pun macam dia pun macam very crunchy rangup like that
but it was like very little but got flavour lah and then macam very sedap macam rasa macam those ondeh-ondeh cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then macam very manis and everything then I cannot tahan also
the apam I ate and
oh then I don't know cause the apam was actually supposed to be one for me and one for adik but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if adik ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the bhatoora
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the apam
and then the the kuah from the bhatoora also still have
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to tuang it's on the bhatoora
doing hummus right tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan hummus
macam sedap seh
oh ya baklava also very nice baklava with like teh O sedap seh
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then bila dah nak makan then macam rasa dia berbeza cause orang lain yang buat
so ya macam tak tahu ah like
oh I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream macam tak
ya the whipped cream it's like macam it's not like serasi in that not not not serasi it's like tak equal like that bila dia spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
I think the satay when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the lemak and then you know the satay punya minyak ah like that right and then you eat with the lontong the bawang timun everything then you cecah in the kuah very sedap and then macam
ya the babat I thought the babat satay I wouldn't like but when I ate it bila masih panas kan sedap gila then macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan
I think the I don't know for me was the nasi was nothing special it was like nasi minyak like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice ah but the they have the like the sambal not the sambal but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli makan dengan green chilli gitu with the nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam crunchy crunchy gitu
but the daging very nice macam makan gitu macam sendiri because it's very easily peel off then macam very sedap
and then macam the minyak right I was thinking if like if kalau kat rumah sendiri right the nasi you put in the minyak then you panaskan you buang you buat macam nasi goreng like that
not a lot of flavour but like just the daging taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli makan tepi gitu
but the sad thing is the vegetables dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit jer the lettuce and everything ya
sebab if I have a lot then macam makan pun macam tak segan right then can put and wrap everything nicely
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then nasi then we still have a bit of the serunding right
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and serunding will taste nice so I think macam beli lettuce atau cabbage gitu kan serunding and then buat macam wrap wrap gitu then sambal belacan and then a bit of macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak
no eh I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so nak beli barang tu semua but maybe we all like
keluar keluar to cause hari ni is
uh naomi's birthday and then like we all thought macam
uh kita pun terlupa then it's like oh then we just okay lah december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
err kailey and ayumi the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like macam
to cause like dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya timetable semua very busy right so nak jumpa and then macam makan sama-sama or something then that time I told you me and ayumi we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right dia belanja because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what ah see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped kena find orang baru ah don't know how see first
bet the person bought lebih sedap daripada you beli because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then macam
tak was-was also nak makan
so ya then kalau you beli besar pun like knowing you you know like you makan one slice then you can simpan if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like lemak manis everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit lah because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one wah very nice I rugi they never buy the apple flavour
if not then go eat at hajjah maimunah or something sana kan sedap and then like
it's besar so dua orang makan kenyang
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like belanja her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like macam treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
minum teh like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you boleh makan kat situ macam tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where macam dia orang makan ah you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
uh my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the uh tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also dia minum macam sedap
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive lah but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan catch up with one another
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like buka the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think kalau tak salah it's
the desserts all like really nicely macam betul-betul sedap-sedap they got assortments macam like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain macam susah nak pakai voucher ni sebab you tak tahu really macam mana nak pakai you tak tahu hotel mana accept hotel mana tak
the ya then macam got a few cafes lah if not also the
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like bugis or something to lepak and berbual-berbual kat situ because atmosphere pun shiok and then makanan pun actually really not bad and then nowadays bugis area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I makan burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
tapi if like that macam susah because from the look of it susah nak travel sebab pasal COVID and then I read up they said that kalau nak travel pun sekarang dah ada banyak measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so macam susah like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but sekarang pun macam end of year pun belum lagi okay everything macam we are still kalau tak salah in phase two
so macam I don't know ah quite susah
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian bakso sedap seh dengan macam chilli sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi roadside makan-makan gitu
dengan dia orang punya soda gembira everything and then the atmosphere orang-orang rokok everything
I want the murtabak manis
oh ya this whole year takde pasar malam seh
luckily my school has some of the pasar malam food like takoyaki all and then like cantine all have the goreng pisang goreng keledek all so okay lah can still tahan but the you zha kueh burger ramly all wah I really miss keropok lekor
and then the susu honeydew tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air sugar cane dia orang suka seh tu rindu seh
and then drink with mango lassi over there sedap seh that time we drink with the mango lassi woo masam tapi manis
ah ya that time yang deepavali that one that adit left halfway
like you see like I never used before right then I was oh okay then didn't think about it then I was like eh rezeki sebab my face wash also nak dekat habis then I actually wanted to buy my new face wash then I saw got new face wash already I was like okay lah can
but I don't think adik will use because adik very particular about his face
oh ya then the perfume nenek give right the bau right stay for very long eh
one after zohor like one two masih ada bau dia like it's very faint but tapi masih ada bau dia and then nenek punya
the lipstick and bedak muka right I pakai right wah it's like eh very nice because the thing is like bedak muka I wanted to I was like I I I
bedak muka I already because like my foundation I needed something to set and then when she gave it to me I was like okay I can use it and then like I used right and then her lipstick I was like eh like wow okay very nice very like very comfortable lah then I was like okay this is like my nenek
no no no the lipstick colour you know dulu dulu nenek has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
then I looked at it right I was like wah actually my lipstick colour and my nenek punya lipstick colour about the same ah because like
nenek wear lipstick like that so I was like wah okay and then when I wore it and then the bedak muka eh okay
but then I didn't dare to share with my friend because like my friend was like asking can I use then I was like no cannot this one my mum punya
in school relax sikit lah ah cikgu tak minta banyak
oh ya ke
so basically in school hari ini kita start sekolah pukul um nine
but is quite interesting lah sebab kita learn about sustainability of uh companies
bab kita um analyse companies and their sustainable uh efforts lah so from there we have to think of um
tapi simple simple jer lah we went to makan err nasi goreng
kampung at kedai mamak at boon keng
simple celebration sebab kita dua tired lah
lah saje jer
you spend time with ibu
no I do not have time tak ada time
tomorrow saya nak keluar dengan boyfriend lagi

thank sama-sama
jadi um the price total was err forty dollars forty five
lah cannot tak boleh think ahead ke
oh saya tahu
sebab saya
it's all on food if food is free and can be replaced with something rather than duit then err
ya I will boleh jimat banyak sangat ah
clothes boleh like kadangkala jer boleh splurge
for me it's err mengada-ngada
err ya other people like example macam service crews cikgu
that one itu tak boleh tahan ah
kalau dia orang betul-betul like
tak tahu like boundaries like as sebagai
spam jer lah nanti besok pagi dia tengok all of your messages
boyfriend kita semua kat army
like semua benda like the system capitalism semua sudah tak ada
then you will bring about chaos lah sebab semua orang akan like fikir
like of their own selves like in ways where they can survive so for example macam food semua food resources
tak ada system ya
so some would tamak kan
so dapat uh apa tu will definitely
dia orang will definitely be selfish lah of like whatever resources they can get
and it will eventually macam create havoc
so as much as capitalism semua orang cakap macam tak bagus it's like much needed in the
ibu makan cheesecakes saya beli empat puluh lima dollar

sekarang ada offer fifteen dollars untuk gel
ah lah sekejap jer
abang ada tak
hari itu nak tapi macam malas jer sebab dia baru book out
so kita makan then we just relax
then then we balik awal
like suddenly a lot of people main layla sia then after that like I don't know she got stronger
so macam layla
eudora eudora eudora pun sama
then siapa lagi
ya a lot of like older older players ah they revamp then macam nowadays
a lot more punya yang we don't use last time macam layla
enam puluh dollar on the game I have no words I am
okay okay lah I mean aku pun spent on harbour so aku tak boleh cakap banyak sangat
let's start playing again ah cause like aku pun nak try naik balik tau cause aku drop sampai like aku from mythic sia mythic you know abeh aku drop so it's like
the fact that okay okay asal kan asal kan kau bahagia ah eh asal kan kau bahagia
I don't think they revamp karina cause macam I don't see a lot of people playing karina so but you can always try then mana tahu kau dah baca kau punya itu build builds semua kan mana tahu kau boleh jadi pro karina so ya and ya it's not as toxic surprisingly lah aku tak tahu asal which is weird lah cause normally kalau cause I always play mage dengan support right then I whenever aku play ah I aku punya sekarang pretty bad ah like noob lah noob so bila
noob ah and ada slurs so macam
nowadays they don't like last time they they ada lah they got say
all the mean words but now they don't eh surprisingly so macam
eh kirakan kau natural born gamer lah ini oh my god
rank apa lagi eh
actually apa lagi eh nak cakap
so kirakan kau just take advantage of this the rank lah ini
suka eh mentang-mentang dia dapat asyik asyik menang jer dapat increase kau punya wing rate and everything err
okay lah I mean ada orang main memang macam gitu so
then like dia macam dragon gitu super cool
dia punya actually I've tried before lah and
aku tak bagus ah aku tak boleh main fighter apa aku jadi fighter macam macam
like real seh everytime aku jadi fighter kan confirm confirm aku mati banyak so it's like a no no but ya that dragon is pretty good macam dia punya ulti kan you basically become dragon
okay lah I don't know what's the term lah cause I'm not as nerd as you but um jadi dragon then right nanti okay dia actually kecil tau dia punya character tak besar sangat then bila dia lepas jadi dragon dia dah collect macam don't know what is it called I forgot apa five whatever it's called
then um meet gordon besar sia dah macam
dah macam besar lah besar ya but I think ya you should play you should play that one or
I mean kau pernah main apa and it's when you play freya bagus lah
so macam maybe at that point of time the the the the the the player wasn't as good lah weren't as good but I think if kalau kau
kalau kau just keep on go kan and main more games and practise right confirm kau boleh jadi top sia hear already knowing how nerd you are
then dia punya balmond bagus sia

so just lepak lah basically eh but but we wanted to go trampoline kan so it's like
kita rest on the first day then second day we just go trampoline all the way so we go morning you want to go gym then after that
I was like eh abeh korang pergi gym dah lah gym boleh dua orang jer abeh aku
so macam I boleh lah korang nak pergi gym pergi lah but then maybe aku just I don't know go for a run but
aku tak tahu that area okay I am not very familiar
container dia pun bukannya besar sangat kan
okay never mind we just make do with what we can okay on that day so we just see how it goes because I aku pun tak nak I just don't want you guys to macam
you know like I don't want you guys to in the morning leceh have to go for gym also I mean it's quite tiring right if we sleep then in the morning I mean it's refreshing in the morning lah of course but
right we're going to cook breakfast right then we cook breakfast then we mandi eh we mandi first then we cook breakfast
container macam you already bought the container mah
bought eh as in like I don't know lah aku macam nak stay in the container
the other end is dhoby ghaut right eh salah
okay what quite dekat what actually
so that's the first plan the second option is the one yang itu lah yang
cause from trampoline park right we'll be sweaty already if we want to go other place aku takut
I mean even if we tukar baju and everything we still busuk mah like we still feel very icky and sticky
bro oh my god okay if that's the case then kita punya our breakfast we just eat mcdonald's lor you can lah can lah not not so eh okay what mcdonald's one of the days
hey the what a hater I mean come on sponge isn't supposed to masak also you know come on now
oh sorry I don't go there I don't know about all this stuff because macam macam I see what's in front of me so my little pony is cute like that is cute like that there's nothing go behind it unless you really go make your reason
sudah eh
adalah kaedah get in the workers are you get everyday
kuih suji is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause uh it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like berat it's just so heavy and
like really tak kisah like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
you the minah that's very bising
why would I wash my selimut
um there's a lot of animes I like to watch I I'm a anime fan lah so Netflix surprisingly dorang macam makin banyak anime dorang masuk-masukkan kan I was like wah quite quite amazed though sebab dulu Netflix there's not much anime
you still hype dia masih ada serious serious because right now um the movie just came out abeh macam
all all of us uh kita pergi tengok movie dia kan
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
and also tak salah aku the season two pun belum keluar kalau kau belum
ah kau baru nak start the hype you still ah don't have to wait so long for the season two
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu season two possibly dorang akan keluar like
ya Netflix it came out ah slow but it came out came out right april tak salah april twenty twenty that's when the hype betul-betul naik ah sia and apa everytime
like uh there's some macam
apa eh I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that ah the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also err dia nya manga because normally mangas like macam for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach uh naruto
dorang punya like the amount of copies that they kan
berapa lama eh tak salah aku one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay lah this is just a rough gauge all of them ah took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
untuk demon slayer for the manga aje eh
dia wah it's only four years ah
dah hundred and twenty million dah
with drums ah ah tapi pasal kan tu ah japanese kan kita melayu kita kita kompang
masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya eh asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar eh
ya the like what they say ah apa actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how apa gui is ah as a person
ah tapi
dia nya other than the anime
um apa soundtrack dia kan
because one thing about uh anything in general ah kalau kau tengok a show or something kan
it is more emotional kalau dia nya soundtrack is a very macam it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer sekarang the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa yang the opening
and pasal
that it becomes like everyday object everyday ah actions are sampai they don't know ah they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but wah it's
for all the animes ah I watch semua ikut yang this dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang
macam aku rasa like one shot there's this thing called one shot animes dorang usually macam forty plus minutes abeh dah tu jer
dia macam a short a short film ah kirakan but it the sometimes like
orang fikir like oh the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters ah kadang-kadang even like those thirty or ten minute films kan it leaves a very
uh everlasting mark in your in your memory macam tak boleh lupakan it's that good ah like the story storytelling even uh the soundtrack cause come on man ah without soundtrack anything will be boring lah
it's okay man it's okay aku nya A math pun
bila entah eh macam there's this kind of stigma ah whenever you go to school or like university ah in that case
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh
ah I I shared this with my one of my friends ah dia pun tengah ambil university but I think is like I think ya so ya ah bro that one is just that's just one person lah don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math kan there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam oh wait what's going on I don't understand sia and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school tau
sebab mak aku english teacher
ya and also macam being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called err from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
like err apa tu there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is huh
macam apa sia dia ni like asal asal ah kecil hati exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like eh don't don't be so abrupt don't be so macam rude ah kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini kan the person who speak all those abrupt words or macam kasar kan dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam oh ni semua ah normal lah takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe] so I'll just continue with what I'm doing ah
adapting and also apa eh what's that word again uh you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
abeh kalau your
then kau akan dapat suspension
ah kau ah eh sorry
after one year then kau kena re-enroll
um when you are in a academic warning punya ni ah ya
if you haven't get academic warning then asalkan your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save lah
ada is that macam kau nya topic bukan topic apa module module is that module macam
kau nak kena belajar pasal another language
like macam malay atau mandarin
orh is it the same as macam
ada benda kita nak kena reverse the structure of a of a word
kalau english post office abeh melayu pejabat post dia dia dia macam reverse ah it's in that that way ah like buat orang macam confusing
pejabat post
oh like apa dialects ah slang slang
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the macam
ah baru-baru punya module yang apa nak nak kena ajar like aku rasa for example like
uh in the market I guess one thing yang
macam banyak-banyak tukar is the job finding
kalau let's say err user experience kan
normally macam tak banyak kerja pasal user experience mah because it's not that known to be uh to be like a proper job orang fikir macam alah ni orang lain buat boleh buat pe macam it's another job
on top of the job that orang tengah buat but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object macam kau pegang cawan
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right abeh kau imagine kalau they handle ada duri tak comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics err the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though macam it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
macam kau tengah bad mood abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa
like err happiness like for example kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja
abeh kau rasa macam eh how am I gonna get to that level so kau kau uh bertungkus-lumus kau uh cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak and that process buat kau bad mood
some people dorang dah so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam oh since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
like kau imagine ah like he said in two years eh
cam rezeki akan di diberikan like don't focus always on the rezeki focus on like
what make things work in in the last time ah macam retrospect ah but for now it's more like
which is why I appreciate like all those people yang even though it's just ah comic books or like anime kan it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
ah for this anime macam all these one
that's why like ah apa eh ya macam demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience lah the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
it's happening in in that macam ah alternate universe lah in a way ah ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is dorang they apa
dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower kan tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but uh they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada ah superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
uh huh game of thrones oh tak eh
tell you about it like macam eh macam orang gemuk like they want to achieve being slim like have that ah that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like eh dah kurus eh sia baik [pe] but actually kau kau tak tahu like the process itself buatkan kau nak slim kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam eh kau dah kurus kan
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal uh weight your optimal image tapi the
the thought of people macam dorang perasan like kau tengah berubah at least macam you looking more slim or looking more ah toned your body looks so toned then kau you'll feel better and it helps to
tapi it's it's I guess this little happiness macam kalau nak go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness buat kau macam maintain your course cause ada orang let's say pasal yang language one aku pun tengah another language is called C sharp programming language
for this different generations like sejak okay ah this past few hundred years ah there has been certain developments in uh certain parts of uh humanity like last time there's uh agriculture industrial evolution kan then there's uh
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam
aku nak keep up to date to certain things jadi macam I'm not
uh losing in the race for finding jobs atau uh skill sets so
aku push myself ah I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes kalau kau buat benda sorang like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
especially if you okay lah probably yang buatkan kau malu is kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam eh ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku assume that walaupun susah but aku I can just Google apa Google is there for me to help boleh search senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri
uh the the amid the Google search yang kau buat
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak kan kalau kau ikut jer it will definitely not work
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun kan kalau kau buat game macam five dorang main ke I mean
ya like okay kalau aku ah nak aim for
apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar like tiga tahun empat tahun ah not not not not tak tahu belajar I mean tak tahu tak tahu buat math like aku bagi dorang game pasal math tapi ah dia nya macam quizzes aku bagi chemistry
lari kan that's why err that target audience is the most important thing when kau buat game macam untuk kau eh best sia game ni ada chemistry tapi kau tak tahu actually your audience is yang orang yang nak belajar pasal math
like iron man okay ni ni ni betul-betul uh off track
ah ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart lah like he might be one of the inspiration where aku will continue programming because
scenario kalau orang betul-betul don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so aku rasa like programming is a
apa eh
that's why aku really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
I mean they will have a controlled environment macam uh dia nya apa tu
apa tu ah udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam this sphere abeh kalau ada ikut macam earth punya udara inside that sphere aku rasa everything should be fine kalau orang kena tanam ke apa there might be a proper grave for them cuma
it's weird lah it it's weird ah cause tak pernah dengar orang ah eh mana kubur kau bukan kau ah mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa oh dekat mars ah aku nak merawat
naik spaceship but that is a possible future also like kalau let's say when elon musk dia cakap uh human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine kalau you have your own spaceship macam kereta sekarang but kau nya spaceship kau imagine macam eh aku nak pergi ah moon jap kau nak makan ah moon burger eh boleh ah kita gi makan sekarang K jap aku ambil spaceship aku
ya abeh kau ah fly ah okay ah ni set ah to moon then dia nya spaceship kau cakap okay uh ten minutes ride okay
abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang Grab pe so kau call uh space Grab
unless bila mars dah ada a way to like
maybe the thought of that like macam aku tahu aku tak mati so buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua you become complacent
then kau complacent then then there's no progress in life lah macam semua dah convenient untuk kau [pe] or aku boleh ah aku boleh tengok anime hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati pe so takyah belajar ah takyah belajar apa takyah mandi cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
makes humanity not to deserve to have a um apa eternal life
but not the things like macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam eh dia ni bagus sia okay dah tu jer ah abeh kalau macam for example kalau michael jackson
dia buat buat lagu semua macam okay lah kalau dia tak mati it's still there ah tapi bila he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because macam oh a legend it has it is a legend because
so imagine if like ah the apa eh
the same goes for ni ah the the the football legend
macam eh dia ada buat aku susah but
ya so okay lah takpe lah eh banyak time ah ni tak banyak time sorry
I think kita boleh start sekarang
tak macam pelik eh buat benda macam gini
you said that you nak berbual pasal
rumah baru kan
okay so rumah baru tu I was thinking
ah initially kan saya nak buat yang
colour kelabu tu kan yang colour grey
entah eh kadang-kadang saya pasal that time saya tengok Pinterest then lepastu
ah apa tu
saya nampak dorang buat macam this deep green punya colour dia macam
royal green punya colour
ada dia macam deep very
dia macam not dark green tau dia macam
emerald green gitu
okay you see this ni kan light kan dia macam something like this
no this one this one yang hujung ni
but it's not very dark what dia macam okay okay jer
so I thought that colour untuk kita punya apa tu
kat mana hall
dalam bilik feature wall kat mana seh
but then our apa err headboard for the bed kan nanti cover feature wall you cover half already what
on top then might as well you taruk frame
entah apa-apa painting ah yang cantik-cantik ke you go and buy kat Spotlight ke
ya habis siapa nak paint
no lah tak jatuh punya lah
okay I ada this idea tau one
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway yang ah okay sekarang it's
right then lepastu ada macam this narrow pathway
ah that pathway kan ada one wall
ah that wall yang now is the study table punya corner yang taruk printer
because sana kan ada um
dia macam ada mini table
and then bawah dia is all drawers
remember makcik tu buat
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized ataupun A five-sized frames
so if if it's a walkway I tak nak
no dining table is still kat ni pe uh entrance
sebab apa tau the
if you put raised floor dekat depan entrance
exactly orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then macam
okay so kat sini is one area
is macam an area of its own
then macam you don't want to talk across like that
so might as well leave it as dining area ah because anyway it's nearer to the dapur what then once you masak-masak kat dapur then you just keluar kan then it's sebelah jer
tak payah nak bulky bulky punya dining table
ah because right now dia punya dining table bulky gila
ye lah ye lah lepastu
dia punya tingkap area is the triangle one kan yang ada bucu kan
ah can ah yang itu yang bucu nya area kita buat raised floor
so at least dorang ada seating area kat situ then you can put you can put books lah or whatever you can put your playstation kat sana if you want to play games
then you don't need to semak kan the living room
because you kalau dah main start main game cam playstation kat
but workstation if kat triangular punya bucu I don't think it work because dia banyak pakai space
and dia punya space tak ah
okay so you can easily duduk lah
almari yang in-built tu
oh ya cakap pasal swing
if we install a swing that mount daripada ceiling
over the years kan nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
cam combine weight lah
nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
dalam house seram hor
saya macam banyak imagination kalau swing gitu
nanti macam ye lah awak kerja malam
then saya sorang sorang kat rumah
which we we want to buy also what you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio punya machine
no seh I malas nak pakai tudung jogging kat luar
tak nak ah swing macam
seram pula nanti malam-malam alone
living room saya nak gi toilet dapur asyik nampak jer benda alah tu
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because dia save space and it looks neater
kita baru move in what
why do you want to alih-alih kan
why you want to alih
if you take it down then you you you jalan wire right and then you just move the mount lah you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole yang kat lama punya wall you just paste it lah you cover
ah okay faham
but let's say you want to alih you want to alih where where you want to move it
then after that is already the wooden punya punya fake wall
ah tukar mood ah
but then that means you won't have your feature wall macam rumah shah lah
because rumah shah is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then jalan wire kat belakang lah berlampu lah apa semua all the lights all the lights
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to tampal
let's say you want to move it depan tingkap
then the lights shines at the tingkap
we don't pasang first
tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can pasang what
ah so that one we nanti nanti dulu ah
tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu too fancy fancy you know what I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
I don't want macam blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
you want the house to look like one karaoke punya tempat ah
but it's but it's macam pening macam I don't want to come home to that kind of house
yes yes betul tapi we can do that tapi we play with shades we don't play with colour you tahu okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel ish macam atas atas hotel so you see atas atas hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and dorang punya furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all macam classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose macam ah simple ah structure metal
so it looks very macam nice and clean and comfortable tau and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
and then we can make it gradient that means atas light colour like the same green light colour light green lepastu pelan pelan medium lepastu pelan pelan dark green
if you want to buat macam a bit fancy
ah tapi gradient ada leceh sikit nak buat ah
that one tak salah you have to use sponge then macam
ah so leceh ah
so macam compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you nak paint gradient macam gitu so about the same tapi dapat paint satu bilik jer
and then you have to buy tiga cat
because you nak gradient kan you kena beli tiga tiga shades of cat ah
solid grey let's say grey ah solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of cat
let's say ah let's say you tak nak buat gradient
tahu lah I know
I'm just comparing the ni
berapa litre ah paling besar
lima litre ada lapan litre
yang bangladesh pakai kan
one big tub yang I pernah beli
oh ya cakap pasal brand
ah tadi I nampak satu advertisement and then uh apa tu
I don't know what technology dorang pakai
tak serious serious macam okay macam for example Nippon Paint cakap dia punya paint is odour-free
odourless and also ah kalau apa-apa conteng conteng you can wipe it off
tak I don't know but ya
I know tapi that's how they advertise ah so
they said that the paint purifies the paint purifies the air in your house then macam wah cool lah
tapi I rasa Nippon Paint should be okay lah enough lah Nippon Paint pun everyone use also okay lah
then the the one yang boleh lap ah kalau
err see if kita nak oil paint ataupun the
kan dua
kan ada dua dua type ya
got two types of paint satu is ah
cat minyak lagi satu is cat apa entah cat kapur ah cat kapur
tapi berkilat seh nanti
the finish is berkilat
is this one this one is kapur
ah oil-based is berkilat is like how ah
it's like okay sometimes you know void deck dia punya pillars tengah tengah dia macam ada pattern pattern then it's berkilat
kalau terkena baju ke terkena apa you buang
you buang sudah tu baju
bukan susah nak hilang tak boleh hilang pun jangan harap mm
ah tu ah
then awak masih nak yang
painting painting ayat tu
tak ah
I'm not saying I'm not saying that we gantung atas ah headboard kat katil
kat ni lah apa tu living room ke kat dining room area ke
if you want ayat-ayat then okay lah put lah but frame
no no you go you go to arab street got this one uh kedai dia punya ayat cara dia buat is so modern tau
cantik gila serious serious cantik gila
no but dia punya dorang macam buat three D printing punya tau of the of the tulisan
it's not old school rumah pakcik kind serious
it's not rumah rumah pakcik makcik punya
paste on wall looks like sekolah madrasah seh
you paste on the wall then macam dia macam mengotorkan
okay unless you can show me the kind of paste dekat wall that I am going to like
ya lah that's why I tell you I don't know which one I like because to me tak lawa
because you want to paste it besar besar dekat living room that one macam
apa uh you find me stickers ayat yang pada you cantik
no lah ayat from al-quran ah
ah kalau words of wisdom might as well I take the A B C english one atau malay one
so you find me a ayat
yang paste on yang pada you cantik yang you berkenan
you you pilih
bila masuk rumah kan ada satu tembok
oh tu tak boleh buat apa-apa eh tembok tu
tapi tu nanti nanti ah
sekarang jer store dia dah kecil
the the pakcik kecil kan store what actually the store is big what
mm the the dining table bulky seh like bulky gila punya kes makcik-makcik punya style
I don't want to put it inside a room ah then macam one whole pile kat tepi tu
kita nanti nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu because tu pun renovation seh
a'ah so still akan berabuk juga ah
it's just a fake wall and then a few macam ah apa tu
ah rak-rak
mmhmm a few rak-rak then okay already ah
and pintu okay lah oh ya ah I just realised rumah makcik tu tak ada bomb shelter
and then the our new house mana ada first floor
dia start from second floor what
mm boleh jer
but I think better if orang solat dekat inside the second bedroom ah because if they solat dekat the first bedroom then let's say we have our laptops
kita ada our documents
and then some more if I then some more if I bring in yang tu ah apa tu
exercise nya machine
ah there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to solat dekat the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
bilik amni looks kecil sebab katil dia besar
you got see before or not single bed then bawah dia boleh pull out
dengar lah dengar
awak punya idea of walk-in
kita ada this macam very short pathway kan actually short pathway tu tak ada
pasal makcik tu dia naik kan wadrobe tu nampak macam short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
macam this dua pintu so you tambah lagi satu pintu ah
and then tempat saya bersiap my
because my tempat siap is tengah tengah what so if I getting ready in the middle abeh you want to walk where got space
because your baju there what
actually kan saya tak suka bersiap duduk tau
I like to stand and siap
I thought it's with a chair and then macam
ah faham
just to taruk my barang barang makeup right
actually I don't want cermin
I don't like that kind of cermin I like this kind of cermin yang you can go up close
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm tengah bersolek
mm laci lah laci kecil
can ah then the laci I can put my tudung and then kat atas tu macam I buy the transparent plastic rak-rak then put lipstick lah ke apa semua
most most probably berselerak
dia tak selerak bila apa tau macam the first few days that I kemas
nanti dah after the first week terus dah macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ
orh side of the bed ya you sebelah tingkap ah
mm mm side side siapa panggil side side bed
mm tutup belum
because I was thinking if ada enough space eh if
couch kat kat kaki katil
you know okay when you go hotel hotel kadang-kadang dorang ada small couch kat depan katil
that's where you sit down drink kopi or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
kat wall lah
gantung kat ceiling a bit ugly you know
tak nak ah nanti jatuh kena kepala
orh rak eh
one simple rak
then after that kita taruk projector kat situ ah
ah then can taruk frames also
then macam it brightens up the room
it does dia macam you have so many memories then you can frame it up
cantik what
because it's very personalised so macam okay for example you go travelling and then you beli painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so macam it means something to you
maybe orang luar yang datang visiting tak tahu lah but you know what
because you are the owner of the house so you macam okay aku tahu aku beli painting ni dari mana and then uh okay this picture was me and you from where we go
because okay kebanyakkan orang kumpul this benda-benda sentimental lepastu they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
dia macam not very useful lah
eh don't want ah ugly ah tampal tampal tampal gitu
dah macam bilik budak
dah macam apa teenagers teenagers punya bilik
wow I'll be your age sekarang
tapi you dah empat puluh
imagine boleh imagine tak
awak dah empat puluh you'll be celebrating your four zero
hello and then bila you celebrate your four zero birthday birthday I belum sampai I masih tiga puluh tiga

okay ah jom kita tengok
hmm macam
pada I semua makanan sedap so semua memorable
um kalau satu eh
terduduk right or like if I makan curry cause I tak suka sangat tau makan curry right so kalau makan curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the bunny chow ah macam mengidam
basically curry dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti
and then curry kat dalam
ya I know I cause like kita order kita nampak gambar tu that's why kita order kan
so tapi macam I think yang kenapa like
tempat the tempat itself
like orang-orang dia semua macam
chill right like dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
tempat orang tourist kan
terus tak ada orang then kita jer
food adventure day so macam
kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan was it a burger
cause also we had no money but kita nak makan banyak
ya nak kena agak-agak
agak-agak lah
oh aku ingat seh aku ingat McDonald's
I remember the McDonald's pasal
aku saja jer keluarkan chili packet um
I ada gambar I think
satu benda tu macam ah roti dalam dia daging
it's like roti prata dalam gulung gulung daging
kari daging or something like that is it
oh ada nasi
macam nasi briyani tapi tu tengah tengah dia cheese eh apa eh
cheese dengan daging ah
ah tu nasi
daging dengan cheese ke something lah putih there right it was a
ya then cause melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita ah cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
oh I aku tahu err there's something else kita cuba um apa benda tu yang roti
itu jer eh roti yang is also from the malay apa the melayu the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
so that no it wasn't bo-kaap it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular roti
what was the roti called
okay so the roti is like ah roti perancis panjang gitu kan and then after that dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam you nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam
ya but it's like a very very long roti perancis right
sayur right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole roti perancis and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
ah terus kita nak masuk kan ice box pun tak berani
tu lepas tu tak ada microwave
so kita macam
nak buat apa ni eh so I remember satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak
uh it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that roti perancis betul tak
and then the next then the next roti perancis
front that roti we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
no it's ya sedap
then the other day I tengok then there's I think someone was also at
the freaking roti perancis
um was we wanted to go to the hill remember kita there was like
hari kedua kan kita dah sampai okay so we sampai kat cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so kita lah macam ghairah kan konon banyak tenaga so kita orang macam okay the next day ya
masih muda that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged kita nak pergi we know tak nak buang masa kita nak terus like jump into all the activities right
so kita pergi
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we lepas just after we got off and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was kita nak panjat itu hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so kita macam okay ah boleh ah settle juga ah kan so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name ah I remember it was something very doug
betul it's like no doug or something doug lah his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb nak tengok sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people panjat kat situ they start kat situ then they panjat and then by the time dorang kat atas nampak sunrise so kita macam eh it doesn't look like
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so kita okay lah go jer so so kita tak tak pakai benda climbing pun kita pakai jeans kan kita pakai winter coat uh you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
tak bersedia langsung we just started and then air pun tak ada I remember
botol air kita ada satu jer botol air right between us there's satu botol air
kasut biasa and then kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula
you know Daim kan yang chocolate gula-gula something like that
I think there's like berapa gula-gula jer and then after that ya satu botol air okay so we started climbing then masih boleh sempat vlog tau mana video tu pun aku tak tahu pergi
then kita panjat
kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik eh belum lagi sampai a'ah so kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay ah
ah puncak dia macam jauh kan
I don't know lah kita dah sampai
go jer ah ikut jer takkan nak stop
a'ah eh tak jauh ah
terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat kan terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk kan then ada bench
then it was like facing the apa the town below so kita macam wah cantik kita pun duduk then kita duduk then kita macam penat terus minum air ah then kita minum air wah macam relax ah konon terus minum air
then by that time also sunrise pun dah naik terus kan kita macam okay don't need see sunrise ah but never mind ah
ya and then I remember kita share gula-gula
apa ni minum air lepas tu dah okay dah nak can continue okay jom continue lagi
continue berapa jam ah dua jam tiga jam dua jam
aku rasa dua jam continue all the way to the top
like seriously siapa panjat all the way tak perasan macam oh go jer
like macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung
tak like waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat kan then the angin
naik kan
ah macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik so I think that's why kita macam every time kita pass by that part kita macam cepat-cepat naik kan macam go go go go
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the kepala and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so kita
but the Grab driver didn't see that kita tak pakai baju athletic at all oh okay kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus
oh I remember after when we were going down kan aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak so dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini
dengan beg sekolah dengan coat warna biru aku ingat seh coat aku biru macam shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so macam I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
ya macam
tak puas kan
we all melayu together
you talk all the masjid-masjid
all the masjid
kita ikut macam ada walking tour kan tapi tu kita tak halfway kita macam
kira was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
the safari so we had so basically lepas kita dah
ya it felt so long right ya like hari-hari ada benda nak buat
weekend kita orang pergi mana
pergi entah lah sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the budak-budak yang ada were budak apa american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans tak complain sangat confirm dorang complain ya
ya so for that after kita dah belajar for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so kita orang pergi um basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then kita ya basically went and look at all
we saw we saw them but like kat reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
oh there was more than three right four I think empat
sepuluh kot and then macam aku tahu we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause tak ada orang like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya same tanah air
um ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they dorang taruk nama dorang in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
and then err at the end of the whole thing we realised yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih mature I would say eh and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other lah sebelum tu when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van yang first first tu semua macam
nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa tau macam at first dorang start off macam ghairah nak mampus macam woo woo woo tapi tu at the end of the
like the whole week dorang macam
macam enemies eh macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk van kita
beginning macam
tak kesah all then at the end of the whole thing kita orang macam woo woo woo
berapa one week plus
I remember when kita dah balik he still message me for photo
I'm like ya like okay hantar hantar hantar hantar
so what what did we do kita buat oh we did bungee jumping
oh dia tolak
ya I was like siapa eh I think kaysa eh anyway I was just telling her like
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just raba raba
so instead instead of the muka-muka kawan it's basically
do you want to talk about the food atau makanan atau everyday activity
aku baru nak tanya what's stopping you
no the question was three but never mind I don't tengok we take turns ah
I mean dulu aku pernah
primary school pernah belajar apa inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I feel like I pernah tanya kaysa
ya you know hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat kallang punya eh ice skating sama-sama and then dorang complain budak-budak tu kacau
similar like if you can naik if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
right and then if you you know especially why kau tengok kau tengok movie movie kan dorang tengok ah macam pretty women yang baru punya tu eh pretty women pula little women kan
and then they there was a scene where joe and laurie pergi kat lake and then after that they skate
tak hitam ke tak merah tak sunburn
banana boat ke
you tak tahu swim you tak nak mati
it's not it's not like the tarik you that kind
tak ada lah
oh ah memang a'ah
okay tapi tu kalau I if you tahu macam mana nak float kan aku rasa okay jer
kalau macam gitu then okay lah bye bye
asal kan kau tak mati okay jer macam floating is the kau tak mati
jangan apa ni jangan dapat cramps sudah
ah hujan ah

ah tapi dalam gambar tu ada empat
drumstick dengan chicken wing attach together

ah four of that so macam worth it lah so we bought that two meal
habis um
ya dan
banyak ah
tapi I think the sekarang the chicken yang
macam kalau you crave for chicken I will go for ginger chicken
cause the cause dia orang ada that promotion tau apa twelve piece at nine ninety
oh dia orang punya six piece is seven dollar something
apa twelve piece
is fourteen dollar something lepas tu
lepas tu macam selalu ada that promotion ada nine twelve piece for nine dollar so I was always I will always get that

ya tapi nak ke bawah dia satu rumah
ya like ayah

I macam then I feel macam at least buat something ah dengan rumah tu really have to go ah cause
ambin tak ada ambin macam err special feature for our house if like visitors guest datang but then it's also a burden to us
ya macam dulu okay
ya and then ayah pun tak ada kena carpet pe might as well just remove everything lah
effort have to put in like the kayu have to go through the window
nasib baik tinggal tingkat dua seh
at least do sophisticated sikit
zen ya tapi tak kisah sangat ambin kalau baring sebab nanti macam you can feel the
cause dia orang punya like square feet all memang macam about the around the same ah macam kecil-kecil
ini pun buka habis terus jamban like
if you kalau kalau the the window the door will be macam to a bit wider one kan dah langgar dah jamban tu
rectangular jamban
to be uh huh habis tu dia orang punya bracket bracket semua ni kat luar like wiring wiring terjojol macam dulu ke semua kat dalam kan

open concept wardrobe orang-orang lain macam eh if we want to follow orang putih kan kan macam dia orang suka wardrobe behind the curtain ke apa kan ours is like
ya and then so many kotak
ya you know dekat ikea pun sekarang dia pun ada open concept
ah eh that time I pergi dengan apa pergi ikea dengan asri then he bought
those macam those metal racks lah
habis dengan dia punya drawer semua tu okay seh at least
oh ya selalu selalu orang beli lepas tu dapatkan kad kenalan habis jual kat carousell
I think because time too much orang baru move in right and then kau orang
one nak benda barang but then you guys think think macam uh lepas tu bila dah beli macam you usually dah furnish most of the things then macam ada sikit-sikit kan
a'ah ya macam dia orang ada add-ons kan
free stuff like add-ons to the cabinet tak eh
macam benda tu tak perlu ah habis dia orang pun tak perlukan duit or or they think
is it yang is it yang reflect journal is it the journal yang
a'ah I can hear you snoring from the hall itu lah it reminds me macam aku punya poly days whenever aku tengok muka kau penat kan like macam it reminds me of my poly
that's why kau akan nampak aku selalu satu malam jer dekat rumah tak buat apa-apa actually aku duduk dalam bilik fikir fikir-fikir benda but then
kau pun nampak ah at end of the day bila aku macam submission aku macam oh chill and happy and everything sebab tak fikir banyak then when is the start the semester start balik lah all the stress and all the macam eh don't disturb me now don't talk to me don't don't whatever don't
eh but kalau aku boleh pull through aku lagi design background I don't have any design background kita madrasah we don't have any art school tak ada D&T art and craft I cannot draw a straight line ke apa-apa but then
okay I cannot draw a circle straight line boleh with a ruler but then still aku manage to pull through ah so macam aku selalu tengok
kau stress kan aku fikir macam ah lah you are left with err one and a half more years you are already in two point two ah so are you excited for three point one chey
huh but you are in a school what kau kat polytechnic semua benda kau task to do you complete what
eh that actually happen to me bila poly uh apa ni bila during internship whereby aku punya internship kan aku design web design dengan digital pin
abeh time tu aku punya task untuk buat it was already aku punya internship was just three months long sebab kita punya panjang abeh
during aku eh three to four months internship so during macam like the first one third of the internship I had to design something for an overseas museum
so aku nak kena design macam dorang punya apa ni interactive punya benda and it's not even a topic that is being touched on dekat poly tak ada pun imagine kau kena buat punya benda
kira macam code tapi untuk punya system orang letak I pad dorang boleh scan abeh kita orang nak kena design that code
and actually at the start of the project it was only me and I had to design for four building pasal museum dia ada four buildings then I had to design all four outer thing so that when visitor datang dorang boleh scan benda tu initially aku kena buat sorang-sorang
then kau internship sama-sama dengan kawan lah ask your friend to internship like sama-sama company like apply together
mana tahu like macam kalau tak kan my company tiga orang apply three people apply me and apa ni kawan aku yang lelaki yang end up dengan sama-sama internship and another aku punya close friend but in the end dorang reject my close friend sebab ada dua intern kat company tu and dorang can only like
hire two interns at that point of time and is a good thing dia ada sebab dia more vocal than aku so macam because
I think it's because it's an environment whereby I'm not comfortable with it's an environment aku tak comfortable jadi macam
aku take a very long time to berbual even dengan aku punya supervisor but luckily but the thing is during aku punya internship kan is not the supervisor my supervisor dia macam assign assign benda jer dia cuma assign aku for one task which is to
it's a mural wall for a company yang dia dah buat cuma bila dia send dekat client client nak kena revise so aku yang revise that file which in the end bila aku submit balik sebelum aku habis internship aku punya supervisor kata aku buat salah abeh by then client dah accept aku punya design so macam hmm pandai-pandai lah kau kau betulkan aku punya file tapi client dah macam eh okay macam gitu tapi during aku punya internship was
aku punya kira macam senior one of kita orang punya senior dia macam higher sikit dari supervisor punya position dia yang apa ni uh overlook aku dengan ni pasal aku ada tiga project afterwards kan so this tiga project was overlook macam dia oversee kita punya design work bukan aku punya supervisor
cuma dia pasal aku punya mural wall
tapi client dah accept so macam aku nak pergi balik tempat tu abeh tengok mural wall tu pasal it's for pasal dorang sewa tempat this company punya one of the room so mural wall dia ada dekat company itu so macam kalau aku tebalkan muka maybe boleh datang tengok tapi jangan pergi atas lah
huh macam mana
dia punya company dia buat apa as in what is the
research pasal
ah but then dia punya nature of the work tak perlukan dia to be in office lain macam like certain
courses ataupun kerja yang macam there was one guy the same area as aku punya internship pasal aku punya office based kan dia punya another group of friend from different course tapi kita orang punya course related to mass communication eh dorang bukan mass comm dorang communication design aku punya interactive media design so dorang punya is like dekat
macam printing factory tau so aku tak tahu whether kalau during that time lah if is like during period
abeh kalau kau macam magazine ke newspaper ke cetak buku sekolah ke
abeh siapa nak jaga machine kat sana
wah rabak seh can't imagine myself if during imagine you
kau ada kawan year one kan
ah lagi especially kita madrasah student kan jadi kita tak pernah exposed to like apa ni people from different races
different ya ke like macam all this while korang berbual kat sekolah berbual melayu jer pe
ah okay lah like during my time is like total culture shock aku kena joget semua
wah like looking back right macam haram sia aku buat semua
ah kau tak regret
ya I remember ya you had a apa ni project during secondary school I scolded you for like macam huh benda macam gini simple pun tak boleh buat ya that is so
pathetic pun ada
actually honestly kan like since aku first kan among kita punya siblings kan so macam aku tak ada kakak or abang to ask things from mummy and is like totally apa ni dorang tak tahu apa-apa and they depend on me kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik shahrul macam mana nak anuh ni semua kan dulu bila aku start pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku can imagine last time before kita ada internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend yang pandai internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours pakai dia punya internet computer remember so aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya email dorang tolong buatkan aku punya friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad tak akan aku nak tunjuk and you like what kindergarten lagi pe time tu like time tu I was
okay kau baru primary kan
no it was like primary four primary six ya lah ya so primary four primary six yang kita jalan gi apa ni bedok library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime nak pergi mana then I say or else mummy tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi library so last time kalau nak buat research ke apa pergi library ah abeh tu then bila abi beli computer letak dekat bilik that's when slowly but then kita pakai internet untuk buat apa tengok youtube video game
ya so dulu pun macam struggle pun struggle sendiri juga like macam ah yes and that's the ni apa ni
aku by the time kan boleh nampak beza tau so time tu aku ingat masa aku tuition ah aku tuition dengan kak mon kak mon sama umur kan cuma aku first child dia third
so bila kita kat tuition I never felt the difference between me and mon so aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama like we learn together we grew up together like we had silat and everything like that and like on these last few days of the kita orang punya tuition ni the kakak cakap
ah mar anak nombor berapa then I say first then mun berapa oh patut lah nampak beza then I was like huh there is a difference macam dia kata in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her macam aku merepek-merepek pun there is still a difference between
tu lah so last time aku struggle ah kau nampak aku macam I had it all like some uh macam senang but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like macam mana nak pakai computer macam mana nak buat ni nak buat report macam mana nak buat homework okay of course I had tuitions lah back then but
dapat laptop
itu lah susah kan dulu hidup
and tak macam dulu
macam kau sekarang by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would macam huh benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu
but then kau imagine kau and last time it was not as apa ni is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation tau so macam memang kena belajar and last time I honestly I was one of the macam lembab
macam everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year aku buat friendster
dah tak popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook oh I think it was facebook facebook atau messenger it was the messenger yang popular
kau tak tahu messenger apa kan
dia macam chatting punya benda
itu pun I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail ke microsoft so tapi by then aku dah ada messenger terus facebook dah popular so macam bila orang berbual pasal friendster aku macam hmm oh I also had friendster oh nama apa then I was like
if you okay kalau aisha ada time okay lah I know aisha baru masuk poly life kan like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one macam pada kau paling memorable sekali
rabak in what sense
tak ada satu pun jadi monitor ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi lah
since but bila first time kau jadi monitress kan was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes aku tahu aku favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and abang
bila ni which year oh my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject cakap jer lah dah lepas pun
ah class ni tak payah dengar lah
kat ear punya height oh
tak tinggi mana shoulder oh
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you pilih which madrasah you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during kak punya time
kita orang tak ada pilihan unless you choose to change school then kita change school kalau tak all the way kita in the same school lah
so time tu bila dah masuk secondary kan bila primary kan kita orang macam
whereby madam rosanna was our form teacher and she taught us everything dia ajar
dia ajar ah english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday kita orang akan mix so someday we just do all english
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class ah like thirty five of us work together madam rosanna being herself a creative teacher she like do art project untuk kita orang semua and that's how we became closer especially during ah like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
ah during the june holidays lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat artworks for example ah old vases kita orang paint balik to sell during our end kita orang punya tempat yang kita for the competition was at tampines mall you know where dorang have the bazaar sebelah tampines mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar hari raya
no even now yang kalau ada bazaar dekat tampines
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of aku punya classmate dia kau tahu yang vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it yang colour colour purple colour blue macam vanguard sheet oh my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet ah
so dia pakai macam vanguard sheet depan belakang and then dia jual envelope macam untuk envelope macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition kita orang punya class dapat eh kita orang punya sekolah we first time arabia masuk and kita orang menang dapat fourth position
all thanks to madam rosanna so but she put the most effort lah because we were like only primary four kita berapa years old then ten years old we don't tak tahu banyak benda kan so then after that when kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu primary four bila primary five kita split class
they just tak ada
so last time during my dorang tak ada my time right dorang tak ada macam ah yang pandai
yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga kan dorang tak ada split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those yang susah juga lah
korang seven levels seh A B C D E F six okay
oh because they want you guys to focus on studies or ah but did you look forward to that camp so tak ada lah kesah sangat
antisocial lah tu so okay back tu aku punya cerita so bila primary five kita split class tau abeh kita orang punya class ground level ground level kan so satu class satu class it all happen when mummy kan dah start jual kan kat situ so aku selalu stay back
so I think there was a kita orang punya senior ke apa tak puas hati dengan some girl from of course lah boy so dorang macam unhappy with the between class five A and five B ah so boyfriend kat five B suka girl kat five A girl kat five A suka lelaki kat five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six tak puas hati
so what happen was like one of kita orang punya time find that I always stay back pasal mummy jualan kan kat sekolah kan so aku tunggu lah mummy habis baru balik sama-sama what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
ada a few clique until today aku masih ingat pasal that is the same clique
who koyakkan aku punya duty roster bila secondary one
kalau dengar okay so dorang dah koyakkan the duty roster and the next day bila five B datang dorang cakap lah aku yang koyakkan
sebab aku yang stay back
yes and ya ya pasal aku tak hold grudge sangat aku hold grudge yang secondary one punya tapi semua dah besar
so lepas tu then after that after that whole incident
mengamuk ah
tak ah because it was just not me I was with another friend kita orang sama-sama
ah macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan by the time akak balik dia pun balik so all this while kita orang sama-sama but the other class knowing that aku yang selalu stay back tunggu mummy
then dorang ni ah
or maybe bila aku tak ada dekat class I didn't stay at the classroom what I will just stay at the musollah ataupun dekat luar
ah so what happen afterwards was kita orang start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school semua orang kena stay back semua dari five A semua dari five B kena stay back aku daripada five A kan dengar
dorang tak tahu tu primary six aku tahu pasal siapa lagi yang stay back tapi pasal dia senior aku tak ada senior lagi nak tolong aku so it happen to the extent that madam rosanna form teacher kita orang bila primary four gather kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang
then I say you were together last year macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk primary five semua macam gini things like that so in the end kita salam and dah habis ah
tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this kakak-kakak stay back
and I knew the history of all this aku kan orang tengah semua benda aku tahu ah yes
ya tapi time rapat dengan dia so ya
tu lah kakak tak suka tu primary five bila but then bila dah masuk secondary kita masih split class sampai secondary one time tu pun sec one a lawan dengan sec one B
pasal kita just annoyed dengan dorang like there was this one trend semua orang akan pakai this jacket do you know my jacket bukan varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket yang kau tahu yang grey and another pink
pink dengan blue star aku selalu pakai bila bila it was that trend that kind of jacket and ya backpack kat belakang do you know what aku punya backpack yang colour brown yang boleh clip ya okay it was a trend and there's this one group of girls dorang pakai tu
and I was so annoyed pasal dorang macam flaunt dorang punya because it was in trend and dorang macam flaunt and the whole group nanti ambil gambar and things like that abeh aku annoyed gila seh so aku pun tak suka dorang then comes the teacher day punya time tau so bila tengah teacher day punya time one of aku punya classmate instead of tolong decorate aku punya class
dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong decorate kan kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam oh my god abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang until dorang secondary one
then bila kita orang masuk secondary two kita sama kelas balik
kita orang different class after that bila masuk balik secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two pasal by then pun kita dah pindah dekat toa payoh kan so classroom dah lagi besar so bila yang secondary two tu
kita orang macam ada certain orang kita tak click sebab dia gatal
but other certain students we are okay with them ah by then kita dah quite click then after that bila masuk secondary three end of secondary three kita ada secondary three camp
ah whereby dalam secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby kita orang semua sama-sama except kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya time
so other than kita orang semua tak sama-sama actually bila camp itu lah semua orang start rapat
um level one ni kat sekolah mana
I think the only time whereby kita orang tak tidur sekolah so last time kita ada was one week and
apa ni kita orang ada arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language paling susah kan so what was ustazah mashallah beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur a day before the paper I think that was thursday kira arabic paper was on friday so dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang so the reason why kita semua tidur kat sekolah was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead kita of course girls being girls when we are together kita orang ketawa-ketawa and the thing is only girls yang tidur
kat sekolah and there was only one ustaz and another male student to accompany the ustaz lah is the only guy in school ustaz was there to look after us lah tak akan kalau all girls kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi kan
then after that during kita orang punya ni ada something happen again so kita orang tidur dekat creepy honestly even bila camp bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh and last time tak ada cermin last time there was no mirrors then we bila dah new sikit that is scary lah so last time bila masih tengah kat kita orang semua tengah duduk it was already at eleven plus
mah then kita orang pun dah habis revise because we going to wake up earlier before subuh the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school kat sekolah kan exam dia esok pagi semua student datang balik ah dekat arabiah dekat hall
then lepas tu
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang facing parade square I think it was there
lepas tu what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby kereta jalan then bunyi imagine ustaz muhammad kereta was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so tak gerakkan kereta pun semua orang
yang kereta jalan ya
park kereta dekat depan
oh yang sebelah security punya ya
and it couldn't be from the road pasal road dah jauh
so kakak punya the more okay I
tak pernah experience benda-benda seram
sampai orang point out
so meaning ataupun staycation ingat staycation dekat dengan old changi hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu kan so macam
aku macam tahu tempat dia very eerie very seram
our chalet time kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali kan tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis the whole thing baru orang cakap kau rasa bila oh it wasn't only me
ah tapi okay tapi itu bukan the most scariest experience aku ada the one imagine ada satu kali tu kita orang ada staycation eh bukan staycation yang chalet dekat pasir ris
pasir ris holiday flat time itu pasir ris holiday flat baru renovate lagi sekali tau they just renewed renovated that's why kita the year before is at changi yang kita ambil
then the following year baru kita buat kat pasir ris pasal dorang dah renovate tempat dia so ah so that time aku pasal aku tak boleh overnight that day kita orang buat barbecue aku tolong the day before
pasal after that day barbecue kan kita balik siang cik shahrul fetch kita orang
so I decided to help a day earlier because kita ambil four days three night so thursday just ambil kunci friday datang petang decorate prepare benda-benda barbecue then saturday the event barbecue some more then saturday is the event sunday is the punya macam retreat pasal tengah ada submission
poly submission so yang tolong cuma lima orang jer akak
kak sumayah dengan lagi tiga kakak ni ah kak jah kak nana kak nisa so kita orang semua tengah bersih-bersih sekali dorang kena beli benda tau
dorang nak kena dorang nak kena beli benda then okay ah tinggal kakak dengan kak maya tengah prepare pasal kak maya in charge of the creation
so aku tolong ah kak maya potong-potong benda tampal-tampal semua untuk batik remember the batik thing yang korang dapat EZ-link
sticker batik ah ah yes yes ah backdrop dia punya backdrop
so nak kena kemas-kemas then after that terus dorang balik so dorang balik dorang letak benda and still nak kena keluar beli benda tau
so then it was three of us sekejap lagi tengah buat kerja thirty minutes ke apa later
terus google punya ni google no it was google ah google ah atau SIRI SIRI ada pakai iphone
don't say anything don't say anything tengah buat kerja
astaghfirullah astaghfirullah then after that terus balik ah imagine balik kul dua belas lebih daripada pasir ris
kau tahu kan the chalet we slept is tengah-tengah laut eh is at hujung depan dia laut pokok-pokok pasir ris park
so like terus kita orang macam hmm that was the
scary experience pasal aku sendiri dengar I myself heard
that thing that beyond that macam aku kadang is it my just my imagination is it something that because from all those ghost story yang aku tengok or was it just me but this one everyone heard and everyone was like macam
okay let's not talk about this anymore so then cepat-cepat ah habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu
but you don't seem like one aku nak tengok cerita hantu
for telegram ke
classroom yang mana which classroom
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the dia punya ni
mengundang kan mengundang
but those one of the stupid things korang buat lepas aku it was polytechnic punya time like it was during it was between kita orang punya from one class to another oh from one consultation to another consultation the session kalau tak salah eh
so macam daripada april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
then kita orang tengah tengok so from one class to another class is like three hours break pasal kita orang punya class straight so during that three hours we have our own lepak place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class ah tap to masuk
pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk so it became our macam hangout room for our course ah
so what happened was the dia punya laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai projector semua so kita have access to main cerita dia macam cupboard dia buka
dia yang buka the whole thing ah so kita buat
tak ada lah dia just pakai macam ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a macam he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa so
tak ada apa-apa lah so should be okay so kita tengok movie so like majority of us were in the class tengah tengok movie and
since dia is a glass door dia glass door kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita but then the glass door dia tutup dengan projector kau faham ah so kita facing projector belakang projector glass door kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok so like macam some of my classmate dorang tak nak duduk tengok movie dorang nak keluar or lepak with others the mix ah from different courses or just nak pergi lunch so one of aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap eh what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
seven eh bukan eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six umur yang twenty six yang buka cerita shaun the sheep kau faham tak so we were watching shaun the sheep abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa after that kita tengok cerita apa tau final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend yang shaun the sheep keluar dia masuk balik kan kita tengok final destination five dia macam wow you guys ah asal tengok one cerita to the other tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa but that was one of the best ni lah
and another best thing I yang kita orang pernah buat was
main hide and seek dekat airport
akak punya clique my clique dengan a few guys so time tu kita orang dah habis
I think sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal that day I think that day was
kita orang main terminal two kita orang main terminal two ah kita orang main hide and seek the thing is kita orang tak boleh hide dekat toilet ah pasal boys tak boleh masuk girls toilet girls tak boleh masuk but it was so fun
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play main hide and seek paling best
ah teman
kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram ah so during kita orang punya
secondary four secondary five kita pergi malaysia
tak lah no is different tak ada during our time tak ada such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate kita pergi overseas kita pergi malaysia and visit universities to macam kononnya future nak kenal-kenal ah universities luar singapore
so kita orang semua dapat bilik hotel okay lah actually ni cerita seram ah
so kita orang dapat bilik hotel so there are kita orang dibagi like our classes are being divided into three levels so example dia level seven eight nine so level seven semua guys
level nine semua girls
so macam guys punya room this thing is the guys room is sebelah depan girls room sebelah belakang
jauh daripada lift so you have to walk in like macam and my room is one of the last few room for that floor kita orang punya that level kita punya room last few
and kak mun was also on the same floor so kita dua bukan the type yang akan takut because we usually travel go hotel kan so macam benda ni tak akan occur unless before this kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room lah so time tu kita ada ada macam seminar sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya hall ah so aku dengan kak mun pun terlupa something so kita orang kena rush pergi bilik so kak mun dengan bilik aku sama level ah
so kita masuk terus time tu ada hall and it's a long way tau like macam ah the corridor macam panjang have to pass by around ten rooms
the room dia macam zig zag
so kak mun punya room is around seven aku punya room eleven tak salah
sama floor tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua sec five dua sec four dua sec five dua sec four dorang split macam gitu ah
terus aku tengok kak mun tengok each other lari masuk bilik letak benda lari
patah balik all the way
itu the worst experience
tak they dim the whole the very old school punya macam yellow light corridor and the carpet was red
most of the time aku akan pakai
oh ya that's why oh so actually mak aku cakap kan um vanilla extract have gelatin
but kan um mak aku cakap if you want find like vanilla extract atau vanilla essence
kau nak kena make sure dia tak ada gelatin cause most of their product have like gelatin inside
ya that time kau cakap kau nak bakekan aku brownies
so kau sudah bakekan haikal
but we're fine we no we just fight macam sekejap jer lah you know like ten minutes kind
no lah because most of them like I'm cranky but then my cranky is like main-main jer
but yesterday I saw you post about him then kau delete
why apasal kau delete
wait so dah dia ada motor
oh tapi dia rarely pakai motor
um takut tapi lama-lama macam sudah biasa
err spark eh eh sorry aku tak ingat ah dia punya motor semua
no it's either spark atau sniper
mana picnic
um okay maybe not friday since friday hari raya haji kan
okay kejap bila ah okay mostly
next week aku sekolah lah
this week aku tak sekolah next week aku sekolah
but aku tak akan sekolah on the thursday and friday sebab hari raya
ya next week oh eh alamak aku sekolah lah ya allah
okay hopefully nenek aku tak datang sebab she's coming today I think
aku takut she will stay until hari raya
then kau tahu ah kalau ada nenek aku kan macam a bit
eh can we try like um picnic dekat bonnet
they like decorate the place they put like tikar all
then dia bawa like bakul of makanan
ya but aku rasa kau punya kereta boleh ah sebab besar seh
kan habis kau just bawa kau punya
kau punya laptop then kita tengok netflix
wah shiok sia habis kau bawa cushion
ah someone actually ajak me to watch train to busan but then out of nowhere tak update
um tak ada slot then after aku macam okay lah sedih
then dia tak update macam okay ada place you know
then you know and then after that dia keluar dengan abang dia
kan banyak orang sia nak tengok like most of kawan aku semua nak tengok then aku macam
tengok ah siapa first come first serve dulu ah tanya aku
but then end up najrah tak update aku then aku macam okay tak apa lah
ada train to busan kat netflix tak
oh my god you should watch your name dekat anime
ya it's damn fun like it's damn sedih like serious like you will cry like legit cry cry
sebab aku tengok dua kali kan dua kali aku nangis tau
huda said it's damn good so I think you should watch ah aku
akan tengok after my english shows so ya I got a lot of shows ah to catch up on
eh fah jap kau cuba bau yang dia orang bagi yang virus shut out itu
you tengok apa bau
mm bau kau nampak yang benda warna biru dekat atas table tadi
oh maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
kau tahu oh wait
so um kau tahu aku kan
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
Zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu kan
tapi aku punya kan it's like we talk
apa inner soul kau
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
no oh my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
aku cakap like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange kan so aku cakap ah like um
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me ah macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay ah then end up aku dapat five points
I want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
kawan aku eh no huda's sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she oh cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go ah like try but then aku cakap like
cause I'm using hijab what so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
macam it's so pelik like ya but I really want sia
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is kan kalau kau eh
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so I think kalau kau sudah fly bangkok or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like eh just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume what eh you use tudung you know
like macam back to back
but kau pergi bangkok bila
mm aku
for temperature screener dia dekat bukit batok hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
kan pelik dia cakap like note kan dia cakap below like for the note they said um
tak ada aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
I never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
lah aircon tak ada biar like I don't want like I want I need
that time kan aku dapat okay someone I got
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then kan end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing eh it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it
so aku pergi double text like okay I was being annoying tapi aku need a job
and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
um hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text tau
err dia cakap hi yes err dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
um dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever lah I just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes I'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like
are you sure you're okay so aku macam okay whatever
so aku cakap mm
so aku rasa dia annoyed macam bila aku macam tanya like kalau ada aircon ke ada fan then dia tak reply aku sia
tak akan whoever kerja sana macam just mati kan dengan heat dia

most of the time like they will only do like macam the important stuff
so kalau
cause zeko brother masuk kan most of the time dia
banyak free time
quite susah lah sebab they have to
but then lama-lama it's quite okay
it's the part yang after itu yang busy gila
he have to think about it lor like you know lagi dia sudah family strict
kau boleh imagine tak kalau ada family strict

mak aku finally okay not finally lah
mak aku sudah tahu yang aku sudah patah balik dengan zeko
um okay kau tahu yang the five hundred grant that singapore bagi kita tu
okay so actually kan zeko dapat
but then he have to give back sebab dia
okay itu zeko dia pergi bilang aisha like macam kau tahu macam member seh kau just bilang like about our problems
then after that itu tak apa then zeko sudah bayar like two days after yang dia dapat that notice
then after that kan mak aku cakap dengan aku
um okay cause we were talking about friends lah like aku cakap dengan mak aku
ma like why you like very macam
aku tak tahu like for me and sarah like we realize mak aku macam tutup one eye for aisha
and it's like annoying macam
okay whenever like we balik lambat okay so that time aku balik lambat like aku balik
before one habis aisha like my mum called me a lot of times ah oh yang kau tahu yang

like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam huh tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then err satu kali oh tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
tadi I mean through text lah
then the tempat
apa eh
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat um atas ni kalau
converse kan nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name kan
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission tau
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if I see my shoes like this
sebab dia punya nike kan she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's mahal
then after that err dia cakap
err dia cakap I was airing it lah habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why mariam so rude then pada aku macam it's basic what it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau ah
habis after dia cakap dengan aku err okay lah so from now
err you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry what like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
um aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam ah whatever lah then err dia cakap dengan sarah I want to buy shoes so like
err mariam don't have to like nag then aku macam I won't nag if you don't
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed I was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use lah but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang lah aku boleh beli habis pergi lah beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
um how to say ah like macam
ya like macam these past few days ah like me and aisha we have like this tension then sarah satu kali
oo I sense tension then aku macam ha lah kau just stop
confirm nanti balik kan dia akan cakap aku err pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time I use her bag
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
she won't ask permission for her macam oh kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like I don't get it
aku penat sia rant pasal dia
far lah it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
um merry eh kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok tau dia pakai macam just
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang kan then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
malas nak go through ah the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu kan tapi dia swee swee jer seh
a'ah macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
swee swee tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah swee swee so like
aku cannot use thick socks I have to use like
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
berapa banyak doc mart ah kau ada
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
macam rare occasion
oh if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
ya I think that one can match my baju because
okay I have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah um tali tau
so kalau aku pakai kan kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
ya dia bukan skinny dia um flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
ya because that baju since that time seh my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct
but then kau tahu aku perasan kan like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
eh baju you boleh nampak dalam kan baju you boleh nampak dalam kan
sekarang bila aku check baju kan aku really see macam
a'ah lah like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet kan
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape kan
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no lah orang like kau tahu sun ah kalau sunlight kan nampak obvious kan then aku macam tak apa ah like
boleh nampak sia like um inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic sia
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too
err macam how to say ah like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam kan
sometimes sekarang aku macam even though aku malas nak pakai
like singlet aku akan just pakai err what ah what's that
the sports bra tapi yang sports bra loose so bila aku pakai at least dia tutup yang kat atas
cause one one time kan aku punya button kan dia
dia very far and aku tak perasan then boleh nampak sia kat aku punya dalam
just hal then aku have to change like my hijab
tapi itu nasib tak ada zeko sia kalau tak dia sudah macam cakap ah siapa suruh pakai baju ni

this macam channel of jobs itu semua and then she didn't reply
then you tak cakap apa-apa
at first I was like senangnya kerjanya like it's easy for like eighteen dollars per hour seh
I am contemplating whether to masuk dikir barat atau like err I don't know if anyone can added like this
itu macam something got to do with like choir the thing tapi it's not really choir but like macam
ya macam nyanyian ada yang menguar I don't know whether I want to nyanyi or not but I don't know where to find barat
like dia macam ah like
actually dia ada ada ah piano punya tau it say like uh I think is piano assemble carpenter and then I don't know if I if I want to masuk do I need to have like a piano punya experience or what atau I can just start from scratch
uh uh mestinya
I didn't know that ngee ann also got dikir barat
ya ke I don't know I thought was only like
have islam ni ke malay
bagus lah
esok err awak masuk see mostly
you know for the for the person you tak boleh
like honestly honesly speaking I don't mind leaving my parents gitu
mm baloi
your course boleh pergi which uni
but the thing is that like like for example macam hari raya if we cannot go back then a bit sad lah mm
no one in my family have gone to like belajar overseas before so like if I'm the first one to go it's gonna be freaking hectic at the airport
but still right one whole army datang sia confirm dia
can you imagine they everyday confirm everyday mesti kena video call like at least once confirm
but I feel that it's okay if if if the school like provide it feel like a dorm atau apartment like if you if you live in the dorm I think it's okay I think it's ya I think that one can like save a bit of money
but like you know you you have to know how to like behave yourself there are like you cannot be iman kau mesti kuat punya like your your spiritual self must be strong ya
like you me and iffa pergi at the same uni but different course I don't mind though right ya
iffa boleh iffa boleh masak actually
bico boleh buat kerja rumah macam vacuum jer she laju
okay aku tak suka suka baju ah aku tak suka basuh baju
oh jemur kain aku suka cuci baju jemur baju angkat baju suka lipat jer tak suka
pasal right lipat baju kan like I don't know like you have to be station there macam if if for example okay like you say you can tengok youtube and stuff right but I cannot I cannot concentrate kadang-kadang
like a suitable time that I want to lipat baju if like someone asked me to do it right I won't do it like I wouldn't have the mood to do it
oh but if like someone like macam tak suruh and then I just like you know voluntarily do it lah finally
oh you have you read about the news yang pasal yang yang orchard killing tu yang orchard tower well what do you feel about that
I I don't like I don't wanna be like racist ke apa lah but like is the fact like if let's say like kalau um our race yang buat
confirm kena punya kan like lebih rabak but I don't know lah I don't know what was the judge or the court was thinking
just just now I told my like I told my sister lah ya every time I see like the news like cakap pasal
I feel like okay lah like how many is is okay but then it reality actually is like quite serious eh like for example like if I'm in that person shouldn't like macam
like confirm it's a bit like severe pe kan the symptoms and everything and like for me to feel like all takde apa-apa lah like that kind of thing it's like a bit worrying though because I selalu nampak and then like you feel like macam day by day your
feeling towards it macam dah apa-apa jer lah
no I think one of the reason why it was because of the election yang kat sabah
fool ya dia lelaki actually know what to say
ya he said that he said that then I'm like like no even like ah is is not even two week tau and he already said that he dah he he baik already from COVID nineteen I'm like apa seh
no the thing the thing about you is that you still ada kind of like ada income from your small business honestly ya
ya like three more minutes just if I miss up then just aduh aku tak tutup pintu that's why
kalau aku giveaway
to think and then like accessories pun boleh pe
yang biasa-biasa jer lah
err sadly due to the circuit breaker the the zoo closed down jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain lah nak kerja tau err
but err I would say the experience there is err pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of macam tourists
I feel macam the camaraderie is is very ya
true lah I mean then again stung lah so people will want avoid tempat-tempat yang crowded lah ramai orang kan susah apa
oh then you quit lepas tu after that few week
so like macam freshie ah
tak payah lah tak payah
oh they approve of your ni lah
you must be worth it lah you kerja keras for a bit only then you graduate with two majors bro everyone wants you man
true lah true lah there's a lot of ya there's a lot of work lah you want to jaga both double major and your part time job it's too much ah even I will crazy man
ah ya hal ehwal masing-masing lah
are you taking of err joining any macam like the malay atau join silat ke silat
macam banyak of my friends lah yang from my err secondary school
all of us decided to join silat together lah
since uh dah rapat kan and then we understand each other
ya then lebih baik lah better for us lah
ya but macam not really official lah I I had to give up the role kepada yang
my best friend yang I feel that it's more suitable lah cause I busy lah with work
kerja then I need to jaga my nenek and atuk
ah speaking of that err about family kan how how are you err ayah and mama
dia orang okay lah
aiyo dia masih belajar situ lah alamak
so macam like err kirakan dia punya pelajaran is a bit uh staggered behind lah is it
but but the your your brother is a genius lah budak pandai kan so shouldn't be an issue lah for him
ya ya my err yang paling kecil lah she taking O level this year
she seems pretty ready I guess sebab dia macam revise lah at home

you need two to three minggu from now
ya I feel super disappointed ah I mean kalau tak I already had plans or to travel around europe lah
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa lah people wouldn't think lor
and ya and err on the bright side also nasib baik lah cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to beli rumah ke
ya oh ya then ah how's your your dad's ah youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya betul
so you expect the baby to appear at eh appear eh they expect for the baby to be born lah in err dalam late november begitu

so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits lah given ya this macam hard
ya and I and my kakak wen is the
anak pertama lah to carry a child for the family
so ya my my mother and my uh brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out lah the this party for us
so harap harap err it's going to be fun err it's gonna happen I think ah early next month also
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
err aktiviti-aktiviti lah yang kita akan buat on that day itself
the government punya pantang larang kan mesti ikut
kita respect respectable lah
eh jangan lah
malu lah
because she can still err go to work lah but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
because he works at the port right so he helps err he is a I think I think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang lah kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he macam gembira ah like wow finally he get a job ah
err ah school err apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us lah for for
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on err facebook live
so they will be like oh ah school of engineering dekat bawah jer nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw lah so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods err jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets lah
ya dia lagi sikit menang seh she said err she said err the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
I actually ordered err ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah I think got no one so uh ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure lah cause the number is
ah the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her lah but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
so mana tahu ah got nasib ah time tujuh then baru hantar
sudah macam one package already
to macam give her I I heard they give her like cremeway alright for her to munch cause of her support for you
aku tahu semua ni ya
that's very nice okay oh it's a chinese girl I I I I forgot I thought it was a I've I've always thought that it will be macam err mixed girl lah
oh really I tak perasan
oh so she's also in our university juga lah
oh she any idea which err kursus she admit in our school
oh wee kim wee is a oh jangan bilang you take double major because of her go wee kim wee
you jangan main-main ni ah
ya pretty surprising eh terkejut I you know

and then we have err loofy on the keyboard and I'll be paying the drums so we just need someone to fit in the role as pemain guitar lah for us so do you uh interested
uh this is sometime next week dalam hari either jumaat atau sabtu
tengok ah loofy macam mana ah loofy dia memang kadang-kadang suka main-main ah dia macam tak tak serious ya
ya that time dia ni dia dia kerja dekat challenger juga for one day
then after that he I think he fought with his manager that's why he had it lah cause I think the manager kind of bully him also but given he's aggressive nature kan so he macam he quit on the very day also lah
he quit lah I mean ya it they kind of buang him lah he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets dia punya orang baik sebenarnya
he was the top scorer lah for our class though I don't know ah for A level surprisingly dia punya result didn't reflect
so macam a bit hampa and disappointment
err ya we doing before solat
then after that we pergi solat sama-sama
oh ya ya ya me and loofy kita orang dah apply dah earlier earlier beforehand we apply already
but usually dia punya slot usually cepat ambil lah pasal dia pakcik-pakcik semua dia orang always wants slots right
ah usually the tingkat satu ah closer to the imam
oh no no no no no err now now the wuduk you take from home ah then
ya they they close off the matikan all the air lah
ya tu lah kita orang tak nak banyak interaction lah with other so we keep it at the minimal lah
but who knows you might fist bump juga in the masjid also lah maybe I mean
mm but this is all purely just speculation lah ya bukan betul kan
mm so makan biasa-biasa jer lah like mee rebus dengan mee soto
wow nasi sambal goreng bang dia punya rendang apa
kau kena try bro
tak tak tak sempat because I bangun like just nice at the ninety four minutes mah
then just nice lah so like I terbangun then like oh my god dah pukul lima eh so the next thing I do was I ambil wuduk then I prepare for subuh lah
so ya cik jamal
ya he was lah but he he don't want to macam made me conform to any err beliefs lah
ya it's like he wants me to have the freedom to choose apa team yang I nak support
understandable lah dia orang dekat kan
boleh masuk champions league ya
oh jauh sangat lah
sean jadi millionaire
so any message you want me to hantarkan sampaikan kepada mister havi
I think tiga puluh tahun kan and I think
he's been waiting for this lah dah lama seh he tunggu go their win right
so he really it really bucks him lah when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak uh perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform lah
my as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy ah kat yishun situ
the daerah canberra
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
oh oh so so you so you were like macam patrolman lah gitu ronda-ronda around the area
wah they are not worrying ah like you I mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
oh err I mean like since you are posted in a the area macam tak ramai orang kan so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
macam tak pressure lah orang tak I don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ah dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan lah so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
oh lari-lari anak around area
but but usually berapa jauh you run
macam the only only time I ran jauh gitu is back when I was in serving my lah they make us run around ubin
and I think that's the way lah macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit jer kalau boleh jangan minum at all
uh habis
thirty minutes baru jer minum that that's the ideology that
ah macam
ya it's about biology larh and then oh ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni lah um ah wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much lah nanti orang cakap kan
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
okay true lah because like for me macam I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks kan macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so uh at home pun I only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only ah the best alternative would definitely be juices ah
oh no I don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause I feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
apa tu benefit lah so I selalu beli pergi pasar then I beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
ah biji biji buah-buahan then I balik I potong I blend
then I letak air then I minum ah
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend lah when you blend kan you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
ah dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay lah the kulit err
oh ya ya ya apa dia apa I heard some fruits eh if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good lah jadi kena macam pandai-pandai lah
ya oh eh grapefruit dengan grape is lain eh tak sama eh
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama kan dia orang two different fruits ah lain kan
siapa ah yang come out eh nama-nama ni
tu lah
lain eh aiyo
ah tadi kerja macam mana
oo jadi
habis participants pun sikit ah
jadi dia orang bawa banyak duit ah kalau berapa banyak hari macam gitu
um jadi ah apa habis tapi tiga orang jer kan tadi
tadi dari um apa sektor
tak ada lah
tak tadi nenek tak pekik ah apa pagi dia terbangun then dia pekik sekejap lah sebab ini tapi biasa lah dia tak ada dia punya maki-maki hamun lah
then I think dia lapar biasa dia minta pergi toilet tapi dia tak minta solat solat lagi ah dia tak I think because dia nampak mak keluar pergi kerja kan jadi dia tahu dia seorang seorang dengan bibik jadi dia diam aje
um so entah um tak ada anxiety tak ada ah
tapi selalu panggil doktor lepas tu dia orang cakap apa pasal anxiety pill tu
I think err tapi is susah to say ah that this is still moderate like I mean moderate I think is kalau nak cakap apa um penyakit yang bila atau paling terhangat kan like you know heat at the peak right moderate lah is should say I think anything more than this um
I think anything more than this kena redha lah
compared to the past tiga hari lalu lah yang
tapi dia ni memang dari dulu selalu apa bila dia bila orang dekat dengan kita orang apa go nak pergi dia kan selalu at her top
um tak tak senang lah reckless lah lepas tu ah apa terkebil-kebil mata dia kan
tapi nenek timid timid kemarahan dia tahap singa
eh hari tu ambil test yang dapat test dementia tak
ah tapi macam mana sebab test dia kelakar kelakar tanya soalan kan
the dementia I pernah nampak ah like the test to do
um bila kita cakap pasal dementia kita pernah nampak test dia apa um dulu dekat tempat kerja sekarang kena buat dia tapi nama test abbreviated mental test or something
A&T kan then apa macam ada dia orang cakap kat situ I tell you the number one nine seven two
huh what is it ah actually you are supposed to go and get her like tested that like for five years ago like when it was at the peak of the light where she keep asking is it already azan is it time to pray is you already azan then you can get their diagnoses which is at the mild stage because right now already at the moderate right
it is there's some like the guidelines to ah diagnose mental conditions susah like it is continuous assessment because ah apa
doctor cakap macam okay dah dia ni he show like five out ah like out of ten he show eight sign then ya diagnosed with dementia or depression but then apa
doesn't mean just depression kadang-kadang kalau dia datang enam bulan later sekali I am very depressed but I can hear voices in my head telling me to jump down
ah tu dah schizophrenia tu but then you see is like mental condition is terlalu susah cause
it's continuous assessment that's why dementia you'd all these mental condition you get diagnosed early you are follow up by doctor psychiatrist early like continuously so they know they see a progression dia ni oh dia ni dah tukar dah lain
just depression kadang-kadang datang enam bulan later sekali
tapi memang dah ada dah lama pun dia orang abandon yang dekat malaysia pun dia orang hantar apa mak dia orang sebab nursing home dekat situ lagi murah then but you cannot blame lah dia orang kerja apa mana ada orang ada time nak jaga mak bapa kat rumah it's like
tapi kalau kita tengok dalam islam kan macam mana
I think kalau you nak ikut yang orang europe punya is that kita first of all kita singapore tak ada space tapi kalau ada space kita boleh buat tapi dia orang buat dia orang tak buat nursing home dia orang buat macam nursing bilik you know
a nursing home right is very strict like you have to be inside there are because they don't have the manpower to bring you out and even if you can go out err is very risky because later nanti anak dia orang datang complain eh why you let my mother my father go out ah ah you know
mak bapa dia orang yang like oh people who stay at their already they also frustrated they also want to go out okay imagine it's like you've been living your life up the whole life in a certain way out of sudden your place in this new environment lepas tu dia orang macam you want to
quote and be be scold or something also like that right pun tak boleh because apa
family members isn't that in singapore if we don't use it have enough resource kita tak ada banyak kebolehan untuk like build something from scratch start from ground zero we have no space and then it's like
our only resource kita punya apa kita ada is ah hasil kita is orang you know we only have people that I would like crops like that that we can export and import so that's why like
you know those uh I think last time your late aunty ah arwah tu dia duduk situ
you mean senior activities macam tu
but if you have to understand sebab kalau dia orang keluarkan I think banyak sangat orang nak literally like rental flats are never enough in singapore
but um apa
macam that time yang for hundred dollar COVID fund tu orang ambil advantage
tu lah
for like the elderly right is you in okay maybe not in singapore because I'm mean in singapore but why doubt popular another reason is orang dah tua orang nak pergi masjid nak pergi temple nak pergi church
you ada that club house especially as senior activity centre it doesn't appeal do you know that that clubhouse one session can facilitate up to thirty maximum sixty lah if the centre is really big
ya so it's like there are people who have to go every everyday because they are alone and very at risk tapi for those yang habis bad manpower is in low you know like if there's not enough space so macam
and not in the activities to appeal to everyone tak tak semua orang nak karaoke tak semua orang nak colour tak semua orang nak main mahjong ada orang nak pergi church nak pergi solat you know nak pergi prayer nak pergi temple so it's like
they should be away like for it to integrate um the spiritual part plus the active aging but it's just that dekat singapore is black kita neutral kan kita apa
um kita apa macam mana nak cakap apa tu yang
ah kita tak nak emphasize right that kind of thing you know and then
so because of that it is not about how I should say are very highly encouraging play a country to practice your religion first that if tapi kita kena buat moderately kita tak boleh over of course lah kita tak nak extremist kan kita nak be good to our neighbours
it every individual tahap um how religious they are tahap dia punya iman it's more like eat in the bowl
so bila you nak bawa orang orang ni cakap okay ah siapa nak pergi mall nak buat you know macam kalau let's say dia orang taruk rental flat like one of the benefit atau studio apartment eh what are the benefit is boleh buat pergi church temple and
um mosque mosque this mosque lepas tu ah church let's say is a catholic church then ah
but I didn't tinggalkan dia seorang seorang
so I I wanted that I'm not so keen but I'm not so sure about how it will pan out like because I'm not raised in the environment you know I'm raised in like nenek dekat rumah
um how to say ah macam nenek kat rumah so I am not the one that go out to seek my to accompany my elders my elders is the one that um my elders is the one that come ah
anything with me if with my family right so it's like you know that that the dynamic is already different dia punya um relationship is different so
macam mana nak cakap eh I I think it's not that I'm not keen maybe it's the fear of the unknown because I'm not used to it mah so it's like I'm I don't know how will it
um I feel sad also macam budak-budak kecil budak-budak secondary school yang macam dia orang nak duduk dekat rumah dalam bilik dia orang because they are because they are the oldest one
then dia orang nak kena sacrifice nak kena pergi rumah nenek
apa ah for those elder grandkids who have been tasked to take care of the grandparents to accompany I think um the parents should the parents themselves should naturally let it flow you know
oh semalam ada cakap kan the discussion dari kecil is what is important how you didik and show right um
kalau you tunjuk dia orang that oh you have to go you monday is usually is me feel like alamak this is a task this is a task
ah because once it becomes a task it becomes a chore nanti macam tak happy then ya but you know you can never know even though they are your kids they are still human beings you made me me like what they are actually very happy with the idea because for me it be like
why didn't you do lah bila kita nak kena pergi
ke apa kita tak nak pergi sebab apa oh cannot cannot I need to take care of my grandma if my friend ajak me go out nak keluar oh sorry sorry tak boleh tak boleh need to take care of my grandma you know like is it for me nenek dah kat rumah it convenient
ya it is a team effort macam mana dekat nursing home ada satu orang satu orang jer ada tiga orang
ya but so jadi ke masa cakap apalah kebaikan apalah sebaliknya jaga penjagaan like you all this tanya right dah tak cabaran lagi lah so it's just a learning experience
tadi mak cakap yang apa jaga nenek baru dapat tahu macam mana nak lain kali in the future macam mana mak nak dijaga don't you think that is the reward don't you think that is the syurga
is that you have to always selalu
be prepared to tukar mindset
tukar mindset
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh if metaphorically is if you put it in a
you can ah whatever makin turun makin turun kalau you tukar your you will say okay I'm trying to swim now okay swimming doesn't work okay let me take a path I let me do some breathing exercises that me just tried to float for a while you know
swimming you are trying to get to where you want to go you get a cramp in your leg and then there is like you know you patah balik patah balik right kadang-kadang like it can be like
it three weeks of peaceful snipping all of a sudden one day it is ah again ya and apa that sucks lah because
apa kita selalu um try our best too you oo kita nak beritahu mak kita jumpa kawan kita hari tu imagine eh kalau
and dia cakap lecturer dia is ah mak dia pun ada dementia she's the main caregiver lah okay you when even a lady who is teaching nursing who you would know is a pakar a professional in these right in having patience and kesabaran cause they take care kan
she also experiences ya she was experience caregiver stress that really affect her work so what my kawan bilang me was that
uh okay lah dia because dia ada background the towel the thick and jake's dump the limit jacket you should you hire professional you know they know what to do so her her tips and tricks is that the disrupt
the incident was um dia try her very very best untuk mak dia tak akan berak dan kencing anywhere
bila nak berak kan dan kencing I rasa dia ada strategi lah macam every one hour you bring every minute you bring you know that kind of thing she has already picked up the mothers are non-verbal cue err bila dia nak pergi berak nak pergi kencing dia cakap I try my very best I try so hard and it happen
siapa dia nak marah tu dia nak marah mak dia ke mak dia cannot help it kan dia nak marah diri dia ke dia ada choice all along ya so she like even like a I'm not sure whether nursing professionals or what lah but a professional who is teaching
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh ya like okay now I realise that even you doctor you nurse as you ni cuma you you also don't treat the patient twenty four seven
family yang dah ada history with that person and then like you they have a lot of emotional
attachment for nurses and practitioners they can always be like okay this is not working you try as so much with your client you try and like ask them work with then work with the family tapi kalau family do decide that one day
there is a professional boundary where you stop at like you will never go beyond it so like family there is no like is unconditional you selalu kena not not selalu kena actually you have to always be there what not what not
yet studied in that I guess especially in the asian society dementia is the terikut perangai lama jer perangai lamanya mana doktor tahu you know even like as much as you share with the doctor or my mother is like this like this like this
but doktor macam as much they are only able to do so much with the information you give tapi like I
think I had one someone I know right um dia punya mak dia tak nak makan kat rumah cakap makanan tu berpasir lah apalah a'ah macam tak suka kalau anak balik lagi so it's like instead of
sitting and eating that meal half an hour she takes four hours to finish that meal ah but did you know what actually what is the history is because she ya she stay in a different child's house now anak dia yang dulu duduk dengan dia ada dia ada bermampu lah
untuk bawa dia keluar makan tapi dementia makes you lose your ability to communicate right so dia tak tahu macam mana dia nak cakap yang dia nak makan kat luar
jadi cerita dia macam ni mm
dia cerita dia macam ni lah like
dementia is you can um jaga because you have heard stories fifteen years taking care but um it's your ability can you go through it or not and communicate they lose a lot of things they lose communication they lose their memory they lose their ability so
yup so it's very important to communicate with your family members because walaupun jaga dementia ke tak bila dah nak tua like mak cakap the blessing in all of this is that you know next time how you want to be taken care of macam mana mak nak dijaga jadi mak tahu mak nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak so bila nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak sekarang
kat rumah that's all
oh so most of the time during the holiday kau kat kerja ah
ah okay okay oh ya lah that time kau bilang kan ah
ya okay lah but still know because of this pandemic right tak banyak orang ah so the you know the lorong right when they all usually like ah lalu right
true lah but tetap masih ada macam budak townees ah
no no no as in like I only started few weeks ago so ya kirakan baru start ah
semangat masih boil ah
ya alhamdulilah dah dah dapat ah
I confirm stress tapi I think it's manageable lah
masing-masing ah
ngam-ngam lah that you all that like dah rapat already
but all this uh all budak history ah
track and field lah but silat
at least ya at least you all know betul-betul joining together ah
oh oh okay okay okay awesome kirakan too much commitment ah
cause you know dia kan belajar kat china kan so when he came back
masih ah but then when he come back
you're like going there physically cause kan medicine kena buat those like physical
ya so now he just lepak kat rumah you know
dia kan ambil kan
you have to do what you have to do ah sebagai you know the abang-abang besar kan
mm ya betul correct correct
what bila ah
bulan oh september ya correct correct
oh that means apply kat
ah kau dah biasa dah buat kan
I mean you did throughout your few years kat the uh
mm mm ya that's good but bila ah bila the results keluar
kalau apa-apa ke apa-apa you just update me ah cause
so so boleh macam you know meet up minum kopi chat chat
ya see but I guess tu kau punya rezeki ah
maybe it's it's better ya kau punya nasib ah better that you've stayed in singapore
cause and then again like the virus situation so belum contain right
oh ya ya ya so have you save up save up for the you know the eventual you punya
oh ya ya ya do it do it do it err I would say it's quite erratic ah dia punya upload like
err cause he has a few differing passions lah kan ah so the initial golf err content that he used to upload right has been on a hub for awhile lah so this sekarang like this past few days he's been you know more interested in collecting airplane models
quite canggih ah for his age
this is the first time kurang experience
ah ya ya ya ya betul betul betul
ya kena ikut dia punya apa
the syarat-syarat
very diligent ah ikut dia punya
err undang-undang ah
dia okay
tu yang penting ah
ya I mean furthermore ours even more mahal lah dia punya apa school the yuran lah so
mmhmm kerja bayar jer uh this ah very efficient ah
slow jer like star wars punya the highlight reel ah
mm dia kan punya
is it held on apa which platform zoom
oh yang the sekolah dah apa sponsor
bro macam mana bro
the thing dah cair ah
but right that means if she's not at home then they won't leave it kat depan pintu ah
ya you know those the standard ones at the floral express where there are they put my macam
ya the standard one ah ya err cukup for that show some appreciation lah
you know sedekah
tu lah it's the standard lah you know how
no lah no no dude that one that one purely my rezeki ah
nasib ah nasib
well I guess communication is key ah yang penting ah so
potential nak kena backfire ah you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it macam tame first
furthermore kalau main also like
so cannot play sampai lambat also kan
tak betul ah ah I know ah
oh apa ni
baik tau
he quit or kena buang
oh but ya I heard back then dia punya temper also quite
but kalau I think
I should be down to jam with you all lah kalau jumaat lepas solat
if you want to go together then kena apply online kan to get the queue
dia orang fast game ah dah apply online
the best seats is tingkat berapa
takde yang rapatkan saf lah
kena expand
the wuduk area now they dia orang taruh apa sanitizer
so then that means salam pun tak boleh ah
orang only the orang atas would know lah all what is set in stone lah
and that one pun mostly kat my
ya so it's the same old kedai kopi and err you know the mall right ya
ya the standard breakfast punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng
ah okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that macam dah second nature kan ambil wuduk
oh cik jamal oh I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest punya supporter
cause you punya opponent mm
mid table but kalau menang the last two matches then
a bit out of reach ah ya jauh sangat
tu yang quite disappointing ah
um win ah so syabas to them
dua puluh tahun is it ya liverpool won punya premier league
but I will have to say ah dia punya though he quite semangat ah
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be melampau ah
is he is he still the regular kat your fire station
mm no doubt lah he is really a budak baik lah
biasa ah you know just
ya so a bit sedih ah
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I kena posted kat foxtrot division ah tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat this area ah
oh I would say there's a fair share of calls lah there's there's still ongoing back then lah err but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like macam woodlands jurong
but no doubt lah there's always calls here and there lah whether their severity macam
ya I I feel the same way ah as as much as like you know the berita dia orang cover and all these cases of
macam mismanagement
I think it's isolated punya cases
cause biasanya macam
tak macam gitu ah usually it's more civilized and laid back ah I would say nothing much going on ah
kan kena stay active kan
ya but I think is tak susah ah tak susah sangat lah but it's
kena biasakan so
mm cause when you when you first start lah like after one ten and then usually you togok air like melampau ah but
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree ah kan I mean cause banyak orang banyak orang tak
tak begitu informed lah about this kind of stuff ah so
it is the right way lah is to jangan minum banyak ah you have to conserve
like macam
kena full cool down mode already ah
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little lah it's cause you you minum melampau ah basically
ah that's true lah cause kalau kau minum banyak kan the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
kau punya badan is like you know get gets in a shock
uh so the more you biasakan with more water then the more likely you will
kenakan the effects of that heatstroke ah
ni semua kena belajar ah
mm yang tepat ah
oh the biji ah biji
biji-biji kecil ah
the biji take out then you blend the kulit but but then
bila kau minum kan
oh do you blend the kulit ah
but kau kena
kau kena like see first lah whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars ah before kau tambah extra sugar or anything lah when you blend
with the sugar level already dah cukup already
tak payah tambah extra stuff
ah lain
err grapefruit is besar sikit
sama sama ya
ya it's uh pelik sia
ya but kau kena potong ah before you put dalam you punya blender
dia dengan the what's the girl's name ah
dia dengan fy dah berapa lama together
nothing much ah I tadi cause I got sekolah what
so it's just school from home ah sekarang
pay attention sikit sikit
but then cause my fridays free ah so I got nothing to do I thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
kat sana kerja dah punya lah senang
but then my rest also dorang bayar
but then dorang tak nak ambil cause I still schooling ah then they say like apa ni
aku actually boleh kerja sia
then gitu duit masuk so senang ah but then wasted lah I never think of it lah
dah lama ah tak makan sana because like
diam sudah no ah I mean like
but hijrah barang lama ah now the people there all
faiz faiz lagi extreme no I think faiz is like the epitome of extreme you know
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if I go gym all ah
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya ah
but gym just very intimidating ah like aku rasa macam
seram ah like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
but like if you see orang gemuk kan orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua pe
I don't know ah later people kat gym tengok like eh try hard pe this guy
forever sia macam gini
at least I looked proportionate ah like don't look so bulat
then these days I want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery ah for the
no not really after ah after still got a lot of outfields semua pe so we still keluar banyak-banyak
makan banyak ah cause of
then it's cause of ah always order in asyik beli jer then sekali
dah getting rounder ah
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
rumah ella kat mana eh oh ya ya ya correct correct correct
uh uh rumah ella
kat belakang ah
like from rumah ella you walk to tracks
then there's a coffee shop there ah Fatty Bom Bom kat sana
eh it doesn't make sense leh I mean like okay like kau tahu uh
but then in this case like abang gemuk and Fatty Bom Bom no difference what both halal already what
so like they tukar nama for what sia
that time also ada ah
so like like when I go lia's house senang ah
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes sampai ah
uh kau tahu dunman sec kat mana
ah dekat ah
malas pe dah cakap malas nak exercise
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
ya but like macam
confirm malas sia nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
but that one tengok ah kalau
if only kalau ada discount ah
uh then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that lah
I never try abang gemuk before ah so cannot say ah
but a bit mahal ah that day I eat it's like six ninety
pasal dorang dorang bagi banyak ah
tak tapi even though the portion worth kan but I feel like it's like two people portion ah
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
but over there they give the full bowl ah then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
I think new ah the shop dulu takde ah
I don't really remember ah because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
I play public game like macam
always kena thrashed ah
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental lah
I don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh sia
like it's more to like main sendiri
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do ah
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu ah
better than runescape ah tapi
like kau kena tunggu ah resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
console pun ada
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales ah they spent banyak ah
dude gila like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
like empat ribu lima ribu
so it's like really luck based ah tengok ah your luck macam mana
pernah pernah ah ah last time I buy the skin
so macam I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like lima belas eh
wasteful ah spend duit kat game
ada ah additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat ah like you need like
so tak rasa sangat
uh uh kau macam tak you like don't know me like that ah
hmm sejak bila
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
a'ah tapi tapi bola macam
like I book my solat jumaat tak dapat

since the booking start I never I never kena dapat I think cause I always book late ah
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up kan then dah tak boleh

a'ah so other people can get ah but some more aku selalu tak dapat ah
tak tahu ah

it's leather you know leather actually murah seh
tak tahu ah
I mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar kan
sama ah
I mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
kau ambil pisau kau potong seh already
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah kan Coke
that time that time siapa eh tunjuk aku uh I think
achap ah achap tunjuk aku the video

Seasons peach tea but susah ah nak cari like everywhere I go like most most kedai tak jual ah

but sekarang susah nak cari I think they stopped production already ah I haven't I haven't seen it
takde takde takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
I think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so lup sup you know

but then eh you got lobang for kerja or not
I don't know ah like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
aku tak pernah kerja banquet

tengok ah nanti I play for fun ah
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish kan
oh uh kira kan macam halo kind of graphic ah
busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell eh
I don't know ah like semua orang like rebut nak beli P eh actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console lah
ada ah main ah
like when I go to my apa ni cousin's house
aku dari dulu kan like
my parents macam
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
dorang like cakap okay uh haris uh
kau main twenty minutes
my father ah my father cakap like eh haris uh okay ah
suddenly like everyone kat uh kat luar then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
eh cik if you want to buy game boy
dah ah tak ah tak yah panggil gemuk pe
the once the slim one come out semua beli ah
I think it's cause it's different lah like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
just want to show off features ah ada dual screen kind of
no but Switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
but quite popular what aku tengok banyak orang sia main
tak pernah ah
oh okay okay faham faham ya
until now I I looking to play it again you know but tak leh jumpa ah it's called what is it called eh uh
total war tak pernah ah
ya apa eh got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro yang
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
apa ah nama dia
oh oh is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
I never see before ah ipin I only see him post punya video ah
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak kan
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak ah
ya for other country is by state so like johor macam johor will be
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
okay ah for me I find it interesting also but I not so into it sampai
so macam like the
malay heritage semua kan dia tahu ah
the different type of culture semua
quite cool eh actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
they control like the whole trade route semua
now semua
what what you want to makan
kau tengok Guga Foods ah
like with the with the what do you call that the onions semua
eh but guga he got his own ini sia industrial size tempat masak grill
at in his home there's like a restaurant punya size punya grill
no ah I think they slowly ini ah
purchase like I think they see it as macam business purchase gitu
cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel what in the end
so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff lah like his knife semua bagus punya all like
ah ya ya ya correct correct they buy dia beli the knife from like macam garage sale like that
ah ya the rust out semua
but then yang ini okay ah yang you know those kanjiro kind
uh huh tak kan ah dorang jual
then is dorang jual like legit kira kan like boleh potong orang punya
that one quite ni ah he but that guy keluar kan samurai sword ah
to potong someone
and lastly err the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world sebab bila you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good ah when you can do things yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat
mm pasal ilmu ni but dia ada banyak err rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi hmm kalau dapat ni best ah pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat mm and bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni mm
so ini adalah yang tiga wishes yang saya nak mm so kita err what about you fathul
pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh spend on whatever and what not and bila awak dapat spend whatever and what not then means err with every spending awak akan rasa this happiness
kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang teleport ke tempat lain so dia jadi the source of this err kuman lah so dia yang spread to others
dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus mm so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
okay mungkin awak dah cakap ini okay maybe saya agree sikit
maybe awak ada point over there
tapi yang contact tracing tu mungkin tak tak senangkan lah
pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia teleport kalau dia sendiri dah suka teleport
mm tapi ini interesting point of view mm so kalau awak tanya saya apa superpower yang saya nak saya nak power of regeneration
so contohnya err jari saya terpotong ah nanti dia akan heal sendiri
saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki dislocate ah dia regenerate sendiri
dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak kan nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang high risk
itu meminta kematian lah
think of living in isolation uh maybe one maybe satu hari bila dah dah experienced everything yang kita nak ah
okay mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya and betul lah yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena
sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang we will never know what they face
so for example bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong so kita akan mencari solution untuk menolong seseorang itu
so mungkin apa awak cakap err betul juga ah and tapi bila awak err saya
hmm hairan lah kenapa awak err question bila seseorang itu nak isolate maybe for months
his child behind then anak-anak dia akan merana ah and
kalau months okay months maybe saya rasa maksimum err maybe not more than nine months ah
lesser than that mungkin okay
kenapa nine months sebab within this nine months um budak tu dia akan grow and after this nine months
okay soalan tu interesting sepuluh tahun means sebelas tahun yang lalu
sebelas tahun yang lalu okay saya definitely akan suruh diri saya err ini ah invest ah invest in bitcoin
sebab at umur ten years old memang awak cakap betul uh nak nak faham tentang certain barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat convince ah
satu orang ni at ten years old dia akan ingat
and maybe along the way mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas and then dia akan start
err thinking back err apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak
ah adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya ten years bila saya ten-year-old akan betul
so mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan err um akan interest awak ah pasal maybe one day juga awak akan jadi famous because of this ah
err some luck you managed to stay alive ah so for you err apa yang experience awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian
I need to add on apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati
it happens whereby we have to train where err train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so kita orang kena capsize habis tu bila capsize ini kita kena grab kawan kita punya kayak
and get back up ah so bila saya tengah practice capsize ini
instructor jauh so kita jauh daripada semua orang
habis tu kita bila saya tengah capsize kawan saya dia lose control of dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah capsize terus saya tap saya punya kayak
bila saya tengok terbalik ini so kawan saya punya bot tak ada
saya dekat situ saya stuck ah saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada skirt skirt ini akan prevent water from entering our kayak
nak keluarkan skirt tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh so saya tap kuat-kuat
tap kuat-kuat uh in hope that kawan saya dengar saya ah pasal saya tengah dekat
dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia so saya tap tap tap dia tak dengar alright bila dia dengar ini dia kata ah lepas incident dia cuba paddle tapi I tolak dia so dia nak paddle susah sikit
so saya dekat bawah air maybe for one minute ah
but I was skateboarding and dalam mimpi tu saya rasa best nak bila skateboard ni rasa seronok jer and
bila skateboard tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun oh eh rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak skateboard ah ah dari situlah saya start
start skateboard tapi nak belajar skateboard ni dia susah sangat err it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
and bila dapat tahan breath saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar uh free dive and that time bila kat swimming pool uh saya ada swimming dekat nine metre pool ah ah itu saya cuba
and dapat lah dapat sampai ke bottom tapi I was having difficulty breathing ah and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that I have
okay ya so macam to start the conversation I aku introduce aku myself first ah
but err my friends my friends call me ash lah pasal nama aku panjang sangat so like ash is the easiest way to remember lah
uh my keluarga all um
to me it's weird lah pasal nama macam bunyi macam nama perempuan but then I'm like comfortable with it because they've been calling it calling me since young lah
so aku tak tak kisah sangat ya so err aku sekarang like uh twenty three years ol
aku baru from uh
ya ya now aku jus
in like various of different jobs lah so aku macam at first like I'm still like looking for my career path lah so I'm just like hovering around looking for as many jobs as as I could possibly find like one of these uh this is one of jobs that uh aku jumpa through like uh telegra
aku I'm a single chil
I I I heard of it lah but aku terlupa</malay
oh ya ya ya park oh ya ya ya ya okay okay ya bill air aku macam pernah dengar tapi macam apa eh
